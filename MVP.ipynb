    "## ETL\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pipeline_executor.py` module has been designed as a wrapper to combine the following three ETL steps of the project into one seemless excecution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `link_extractor.py`: A performant, multi-threaded web-scraping module which uses a selection of Search Engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo) to gather a large variety of news article URL`s that are used downstream to extract a corpus of news data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `content_extractor.py`: A performant, multi-threaded, and well-generalizing web-scraping module used to extract news text content from a variety of sources. Makes use of two approaches to gather data if the first one fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `content_cleaner.py`: A functional module used to preprocess the extracted news text. Takes into account length of extracted text, cleans punctuation, and uses regex patterns to filter out links, e-mails, phone numbers, as well as other phrases which indicate unusable text (ex: \"Are you a robot?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `execute()` method, the user can specify his search query, if he/she wishes to limit the amount of retrieved news articles, and if he/she wants to overwrite any existing files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usability and performance oriented design choices:\n",
    "| Feature | Rationale | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| Dynamic thread assignment | Performance | The number of assigned threads depends on the number of tasks, CPU cores, and free memory the machine has access to.\n",
    "| Anti-scraping measure circumvention | Usability / Perfromance | To make the webscraper appear more human, the following has been implemented: timeouts, user-agents (HTTP headers), HTTP sessions (keep connection open between client and server)\n",
    "| Logging | Usability | Logging has been implemented in the ETL process to allow users to monitor code and easily debug (if necessary)\n",
    "| Direct Requests | Performance | As of now, the use of headless browsers has not been deemed necessary due to the noticeable performance impact associated with them. However, it should be noted that tools such as selenium or playwright are easily integratable due to the object-oriented design of the ETL process.\n",
    "| Caching | Performance | If the user already searched for a sepcific query, the locally saved data is used instead of running the entire web-scraper again (this behavior can be overwritten)\n",
    "| Search Query Behavior | Usability | Any news topic can be searched for by the user. This includes Search Engine specific functionality such as boolean operators and quotes to find exact matches"

    "\n",
    "The `word_wizard.py` module is a performant and feature rich NLP module capable of performing various operations on the dataframe that gets returned from the ETL pipeline. When initializing a WordWizard object, the user can specify on which basis he/she wishes to analyze the data (either the entire article, or on paragraphs). For more precise analysis, this is done on single paragraphs by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usability and performance oriented design choices:\n",
    "| Feature | Rationale | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| Pretrained Models | Performance / Usability | Especially in tasks that are universally similar, such as language, using preatrained models often rpooves beneficial. With the exception of some unsupervised lerning approaches, the NLP pipe makes use of a variety of pretrained models. This allows us to benefit from performant models, trained on magnitudes of data so large that entire datacenters are needed, while using everyday computer systems.\n",
    "| GPU acceleration | Performance | The NLP pipeline automatically detects and selects the most powerful device possible for Deep Learning Inference. This can also be overriden by the user for each method and defaults to the CPU if no GPU is detected. Currently supports NVIDIA's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and Apple's Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) software frameworks.\n",
    "| Lean Models | Performance | With computational complexity in mind, most WordWizard methods have been designed in a way that allows the user to choose between a heavy (and usually more performant) or lean (and potentially less performant) model. As is, lean models are preferred by the WordWizard.\n",
    "\n",
    "General NLP Pipe Roadmap:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Create Embeddings:** Either using `create_sentence_embeddings()` or `create_word_embeddings()`. Word embeddings offer more in-depth word analysis and a very fine-grained representation of text. However, they often struggle with Polysemy (words having multiple meanings -> Apple the fruit or the company?) and inherently loose contextual information. Sentence embeddings offer better contextual representations and appear to be more performant but end up loosing specific in-debth word-level information. Ultimately, the choice is context specific and one or the other may offer better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Create Clusters:**  Clustering is done using the `cluster_embeddings()` method and serves the purpose of identifying and combining common news topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Any of the following:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `summarize_medoids()`: Creates a summary of embeddings closest to the center of a cluster.\n",
    "- `find_sentiment()`: Calculates a sentiment score for each piece of news data in the WordWizard.\n",
    "- `entity_recognition()`: Filters out the most common entities in the news data corpus.\n",
    "- `topic_modelling()`: Identifies meta-topics amongst the news corpus.\n",
    "- `topic_modelling()`: Reduces the dimensionality of the embeddings for easier downstream analysis in tasks such as visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Perfrom further analysis using the enhanced dataframe from the WordWizard object**"

For specific and crucial tasks, it promises to be<br>exponentially faster than the zero-or-one binary technology that underlies today's machines, from<br>supercomputers in laboratories to smartphones in our pockets. But developing quantum computers<br>hinges on building a stable network of qubits—or quantum bits—to store information, access it and<br>perform computations.",
          "While these particles had never been observed in nature, theorists predicted they could be created<br>in a particular type of semiconductor device and used to build the components for a robust quantum<br>computer.",
          "The recent flows and therefore the growth opportunities within the market in the approaching amount<br>are highlighted. Major players/suppliers worldwide and market share by regions, with company and<br>product introduction, position in the global Quantum Computing market including their market status<br>and development trend by types and applications which will provide its price and profit status, and<br>marketing status & market growth drivers and challenges.

In our list of priorities, you-our patron-come at<br>the top. You can be sure of the best cost-effective, value-added package from us, should you decide<br>to engage with us.",
          "Ultimately, quantum computers excel at solving a certain class of problems. It’s infeasible or<br>unrealistic to use them for many of the tasks that we use computers for today, such as accessing and<br>reading this whitepaper.",
          "Despite these challenges, there has been significant progress in the field of quantum computing in<br>recent years. Companies like IBM, Google, and Intel are investing heavily in quantum computing<br>research, and several startups are working on developing quantum hardware and software. Moreover,<br>governments around the world are recognizing the importance of quantum computing and are providing<br>funding and support for research in this area.",
          "After completing their master’s, they pivoted to a different technology called superconducting<br>quantum computing. Instead of suspended atoms, this technology uses tiny electric circuits that are<br>exceptional at carrying electric current. To control these circuits, researchers only need to send<br>electric signals."
