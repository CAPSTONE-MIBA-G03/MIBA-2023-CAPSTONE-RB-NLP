NorthWestern approached South Dakota’s utility commission Feb. 8, asking for approval to bill customers for a nuclear power plant study. The company indicated that it had already done a month’s work with global consultancy Roland Berger and planned to meet a May application deadline for federal subsidies.

The path for nuclear power in Montana is complicated, the utility told South Dakota regulators. In both states, NorthWestern identifies nuclear power as an option to replace retiring coal-fired power plants, should it be forced to do so by regulators, though In Montana the utility is preparing to double the amount of owned coal power in its portfolio.

“NorthWestern has not identified a date certain for nuclear in Montana, only the possibility. But to be ready for the possibility, NorthWestern has modeled retirement scenarios that include adding nuclear in 2030 and 2035,” the company told the South Dakota Public Utility Commission.

Bill Gates' nuclear energy company TerraPower and utility Rocky Mountain Power plan to bring a nuclear power plant, to Wyoming. The small modular reactor will make use of a molten salt energy storage system. Note: this image a rendering of the nuclear power plant.

In January, NorthWestern CEO Brian Bird hinted to a Helena audience that the current site of Colstrip Power Plant could be suitable for a nuclear reactor after Colstrip closes, possibly by the end of the decade.

""Guess what a great location to build a non-carbon emitting resource would be? Colstrip has fantastic transmission, consistent transmission that serves us today. It has a highly skilled workforce, who certainly could be trained in other resources down the road, "" Bird told the audience.

Both the construction timeline presented by the utility, as well as the price don’t reflect the current struggles of nuclear power plants. NorthWestern’s Jeff Decker told South Dakota regulators a 320 megawatt power plant would likely cost between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion, far less than current nuclear power projects, which are currently costing much more, and taking much longer to build than planned.

“Even if it’s the overnight cost that doesn’t include escalation, or financing costs, this is way too low, per kilowatt,” said David Schlissel, director of resource planning analysis at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “It’s way too low. No plant like this has been built or operated. It’s just over-optimistic hype to get money to do a study on a project. Prudence would say wait until others have built these reactors, see how much they cost and how well they work.”

Asked how it came up with its cost estimate, NorthWestern offered a prepared statement that didn’t attempt an answer.

“In South Dakota, NorthWestern Energy applied for an accounting order associated with a nuclear study bill. NorthWestern Energy has not made any decision whether to proceed to develop carbon-free nuclear generation,” said Jo Dee Black, a NorthWestern spokesperson. “Rather, this study is intended to help NorthWestern Energy understand the evolving technology and its costs.”

Regionally, the nuclear reactor project that is furthest along, with inflation driving up cost estimates, is the NuScale small modular reactor partnership with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems. The estimated price of the 462-megawatt reactor has increased 75% from $5.3 billion to $9.3 billion. The price of the power to cover the bill has risen from $58 per megawatt hour to $89.

UAMPS members are municipal-based monopoly utilities, who make good partners for the cutting-edge projects because utility customers are “captive” meaning they cannot shop around for a better deal and would be obligated to cover reactor costs.

A larger scale project by Georgia Power has seen its estimated price increase from $14 billion to $30 billion with a completion date delayed 6 years.

TerraPower announced in December that it was delaying its plans for a reactor in Wyoming by two years because Russia was its lone fuel source and the rogue nation's war with Ukraine is complicating supply.

In Washington, small modular reactor developer X-energy Reactor Company announced that it was withdrawing plans to build a reactor at the federal government’s Hanford nuclear site near the Tri-Cities. The Washington reactor was to be X-energy’s first, a demonstration project that will now be relocated to a Dow Chemical site on the Gulf Coast, according to the company.

X-energy’s reactor project was similar to the one described by NorthWestern to the South Dakota PUC, an 80 MW reactor that could be scaled up to 320 MW in what X-energy described as a 4-pack of reactors. X-energy was selected by the Department of Energy to receive up to $1.2 billion to develop a reactor and fuel fabrication facility by 2030. The reactor is a 76 MW capacity small modular unit.

Following a merger earlier this year, X-energy’s new owner, Ares Acquisition Corp., issued a cautionary note with the Securities and Exchange Commission warning investors about the risks of investing in projects like theirs.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Truck driver Yuichi Tomita has been delivering packages all over Japan for two decades, often clocking 40 straight hours on the road. He says the work is tough but a source of pride, and one he's never thought of quitting - until now.

On April 1, 2024, the government will limit truck drivers' annual overtime to 960 hours, among other reforms officials say are meant to improve the job's notoriously gruelling conditions and make it more attractive.

Drivers such as Tomita say the law will instead lead to an exodus from an occupation where most need those extra hours to pay the bills.

That has sparked fears of what those in retail and logistics call the ""2024 crisis"": a critical shortage of truck drivers that, if unaddressed, could leave a third of all cargo undelivered and result in a potential 10 trillion yen ($76 billion) hit to the world's third-largest economy by 2030, by government estimates.

""I've been doing this job for 20 years and you just can't make ends meet on base pay alone,"" said Tomita, a second-generation trucker and father of a 3-year-old. ""I really think this crisis is going to threaten Japan's economy and families like ours.""

Drivers make 4.46 million yen ($34,000) a year on average. That is about 10% below the average for all industries despite working 20% longer hours.

An expected drop-off in the number of truck drivers would set off a domino effect for farmers, shops and diners accustomed to next-day delivery of fresh fish and crisp produce.

The global consultancy Roland Berger expects a 20% decline in the number of Japanese truck drivers in the decade to 2030.

""Simply put, people in Tokyo will have no means to get fresh vegetables or fish from Kyushu (in southern Japan) and other far-off regions,"" said Masashi Onozuka, a partner at consultancy

Roland Berger who serves on the government's study group for

sustainable logistics systems. ""That could affect consumer spending and other areas too.""

SQUEEZED

About 98% of Japan's 62,000 trucking companies - responsible for delivering almost all of the country's cargo - are small operations. Fierce competition and high fuel prices mean truck drivers are squeezed too despite an acute labour shortage.

A recent government survey showed trucking companies were able to pass on only 19% of their cost increases, compared with 47% for small- and medium-sized firms. That would make it difficult for small companies to hire to make up for the lower number of legal working hours per driver.

Underscoring the difficulties smaller players face, the Fair Trade Commission in December named and shamed 13 firms that it said abused their superior bargaining power to refuse price increase requests from smaller contractors and suppliers. Six were logistics and delivery majors, including Trancom and Sagawa Express. Both companies promised to make improvements.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida last month instructed his cabinet to come up with ""drastic"" measures by June to address the crisis. A dedicated lane over a 100km (62-mile) stretch of highway connecting Tokyo and Nagoya for self-driving trucks and a flight route for delivery drones are planned from next fiscal year.

Some retailers have devised ways to soften the impact.

Convenience store operator Lawson will reduce deliveries of lunch boxes to twice a day from three times for all outlets by April 2024. Supermarket chain operators Summit, Maruetsu, Yaoko and Life Corp agreed to allow an extra day for delivery and reduce overnight shipping.

Many far-flung producers, though, have no plan.

Farmers and fish wholesalers from Kyushu to the northernmost island of Hokkaido fear for their livelihood and local economies if there aren't enough drivers.

Masaaki Iwamori, an official at the Ehime Fishers Cooperative on the western island of Shikoku, said the town of Uwajima could wither without trucks to deliver its famed amberjack by 2 a.m. to Tokyo's main fish market, a 12-hour drive away.

""If the fish aren't ready in time, they lose their freshness when they're auctioned the next day"" at a significant discount, he said. ""Maybe once consumers start noticing the drop in quality, they'll share the sense of crisis.""

As of 31st December, there were over 1,650 organizations and the ecosystem, comprising the geographic region of the Middle East and North Africa and its Blockchain, Crypto, Metaverse and Web3 related organisations, has been growing faster than previously anticipated.



The Ecosystem has witnessed a sturdy 13.8% growth, while Crypto Oasis is expected to continue robust growth in the coming months, as regulators in the region welcome innovation and disruption, making it easier for blockchain-related companies to secure licences and operate. At the forefront of this is Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) which is home to over 500 of these native Blockchain organisations, representing the largest concentration of crypto and blockchain companies in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.



Crypto Oasis has added 200+ new organisations in Q4 2022 that have brought in 1,300+ new professionals to the burgeoning Ecosystem, bringing the total number of individuals working in this industry to 8,300+. This 19% growth in employment numbers can be attributed to the UAE being a force to reckon with in the global Blockchain landscape. 78.2% (approx. 6,500) of these individuals work in native blockchain organisations, i.e. those which are focused on blockchain and related decentralised technologies. 21.8 (approx. 1,800) percent work for non-native companies, i.e. those that offer blockchain related services or products but do not have blockchain as their primary focus.



Ralf Glabischnig, Founder of Crypto Oasis, stated, ""We're thrilled to have identified these new organisations in our ecosystem that are contributing to a diverse community of stakeholders. The possibilities for Web3 technology are vast, from finance and supply chain management to gaming and social media. However, as it's a relatively new and emerging technology, its full potential hasn't been reached yet and the industry is facing challenges such as scalability, security, and user adoption. It's an exciting and rapidly evolving field to watch and we're eager to collaborate and learn from each other as we work to improve Web3 and decentralised technologies.""



The Crypto Oasis supports blockchain and Web3 organisations to access resources and expertise that can help them navigate the complex and rapidly evolving landscape. In addition, joining the ecosystem gives them the opportunity to network with potential partners and customers, and to showcase their work to a wider audience.



""The UAE is the perfect amalgamation of Talent and Capital built on a world class Infrastructure,"" said Saqr Ereiqat, Co-Founder of Crypto Oasis. ""The Ministry of Economy (MoE) has become one of the first Government entities in the world to be active in the metaverse. In 2022 the MoE published its Digital Economy Strategy which aims to double the contribution of digital economy from 9.7% to 19.4% in the next decade. The inception of regulators like VARA and various industry events like the Abu Dhabi Finance Week and Dubai Fintech Week, as well as the launch of the Dubai Economic Agenda ""D33"", demonstrate UAE's commitment in taking an active step to becoming the centre of digital economy globally.""



The inaugural version of the Crypto Oasis Ecosystem Report 2022, published in partnership with Roland Berger in October'22, identified 1,450+ Web3 organisations in the UAE as of end Q3 2022. This report aimed to establish the first quantitative and qualitative study of the Crypto Oasis ecosystem. Commenting on the growth of the Ecosystem, Pierre Samaties, Partner and Global Head of Crypto Economy and Web3 at Roland Berger, a top tier strategy consulting firm said: ""The UAE is uniquely positioned to play a leading role in the global innovation economy. The growth of the Crypto Oasis Ecosystem will continue in the coming months as we can already witness how regulators in the region are welcoming innovation and disruption, making it simpler for Blockchain-related companies to secure licenses and operate.""



The Crypto Oasis Ecosystem is dedicated to building and strengthening the infrastructure for decentralised technologies in this region. The Ecosystem fosters collaboration and intends to pool resources and expertise to create a more robust and resilient environment to build, create and operate. The Web3 Ecosystem serves the needs of all of its members and has a positive impact on the wider community by helping drive innovation related to decentralised technology. New members of the ecosystem will have the opportunity to contribute to this effort and shape the direction of Web3 development in our region.

The bespoke British brand and mass-market Korean automaker announced this week at the UK’s Farnborough Airshow a memorandum of understanding to explore applying fuel cells (which turn hydrogen into electricity) to advance air mobility.

More from Robb Report

Fuel cells could quadruple the range of a battery-electric aircraft, according to Matheu Parr, customer director at Rolls-Royce Electrical, the marque’s electric aviation division.

Rolls-Royce, the world’s second-largest aircraft engine manufacturer after General Electric, launched the unit in January 2022 to answer the pressing question, “What is the electrification of aerospace?” Parr said.

Fuel cell technology unlocks a world of potential in an industry poised for exponential growth over the next couple of decades. Consulting firm Roland Berger forecasts that the urban air mobility market will mushroom from an industry worth $1 billion in 2030 to $90 billion by 2050.

“It’s an order of scale above where we normally operate,” Parr said. “That’s where Hyundai comes in.”

Discussions between the brands began at the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show, where Hyundai detailed its plans to focus on different modes of urban transportation.

The project will borrow from Rolls-Royce’s legacy in aviation and Hyundai’s expertise in fuel-cell technology to deliver a battery-electric aircraft demo by 2025. Parr said the conveyance will likely be a nine-seat fixed-wing aircraft like a Tecnam P-Volt.

The trend toward transportation companies rebranding as mobility technology businesses has opened up the skies as a new place to pilot electric and autonomous technology. Those developments may even wind up back on the ground, powering a new generation of electric vehicles.

Story continues

Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for the Airbus A350, dons a decorated past after more than a century in aerospace. Its technology has powered historic flights from the Comet—the first aircraft to offer commercial service between New York and London, in 1958—to the Concorde, the late 20th-century supersonic jet that shortened the journey to three hours.

Hyundai is no stranger to the skies, either. The South Korean automaker is spending billions on flying taxis, eVTOL aircraft, and other advanced air mobility modes to transport the people and goods of tomorrow. To oversee the aviation efforts, Hyundai hired an aerospace expert as the chief technology officer of Supernal, its Washington, DC-based urban air mobility business.

FILE PHOTO: Chinese tourists shop at a Lotte duty free shop in central Seoul

By Casey Hall

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - An end to China's travel curbs this month is expected to revive demand in the global luxury retail market, which has been starved of mainland visitors for three years, but many consumers now see more reasons to do their high-end shopping locally.

Share prices of global luxury brands jumped last week after Beijing announced it would loosen travel restrictions from Jan. 8, effectively allowing Chinese tourists to once again flock to global shopping hubs from Paris to Tokyo.

However, analysts and luxury brands warn they are unlikely see an immediate return to pre-pandemic levels of Chinese travellers with airlines yet to fully resume operations and local prices falling. Just as importantly, big luxury brands are now investing more in the shopping experience in China.

One Shanghai shopper, surnamed Mao, said that she had visited boutiques around the world for years, but now believes she gets the best service in China.

""When I would go to Paris, I couldn't ask the Paris sales people to keep a bag for me, but now here we can,"" she said.

Before the pandemic closed borders early in 2020, Chinese shoppers bought 70% of their luxury goods abroad.

Under pandemic travel curbs, China's domestic luxury sales boomed, doubling to 471 billion yuan ($68.25 billion) from 2019 to 2021, according to Bain & Co. Even so, Chinese consumers' share of the global market fell to 21% in 2021 from 25% in 2019.

Luxury gains https://www.reuters.com/graphics/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/CHINA-LUXURY/jnpwyymgypw/chart.png

""It won't go back to 70%,"" said Jonathan Yan, a principal at consultancy Roland Berger in Shanghai. ""I'm sure there will still be a portion of luxury spending happening in other countries, because it's natural people like to shop when we travel, but it will be more like 50-50.""

Many luxury companies such as LVMH's Louis Vuitton and Coach-parent Tapestry doubled down in China over the past three years, opening new flagship stores and hosting large fashion shows to reach consumers unable to go abroad.

Story continues

This helped local staff cultivate relationships with China's VIP customers, who previously preferred to shop overseas.

Research conducted by Hong Kong-based consultancy Oliver Wyman showed 70% of China's luxury consumers used sales assistants to facilitate purchases while 40% communicate with sales staff at least once per week.

Oliver Wyman's Kenneth Chow says that half of Chinese consumers who bought luxury in 2021 were doing so for the first time.

""It will be interesting to see how new luxury consumers will perceive the difference between domestic and overseas luxury shopping,"" he said.

ALTERNATIVES

International travel restrictions and local policies to spur spending also drove many consumers to China's tax-free island of Hainan as a luxury shopping destination.

In 2021, Hainan accounted for 13% of China's domestic luxury spend, versus 6% pre-pandemic, and tax regulations are set to continue to loosen. By 2025, luxury brands will be able to operate their own duty-free stores, rather than rely on partnerships with local players such as China Duty Free Group.

Hainan's popularity is expected to continue, Roland Berger's Yan says, as only 13% of Chinese citizens have a passport, making a tax-free domestic destination enormously attractive.

Hainan, as well as Beijing's moves to lower import tariffs on luxury goods in 2018 and 2019, have consequently dulled some of the appeal to shop abroad for some more price-conscious shoppers, with handbags now about 10-20% more expensive in China, from 50-60% previously.

At 14,400 yuan ($2,090), Louis Vuitton's medium-sized Neverfull bag is only 18% more expensive in Shanghai than in Paris, if travelers claim their 12% VAT refund.

Luca Solca, senior research analyst at Bernstein, said brands will continue working to narrow cross-border price differences, though efforts are further complicated by currency depreciation against the dollar.

""The return of the Chinese to Europe, where prices are lower, will take some time,"" he said, predicting a widespread return to long-haul travel in 2024.

Searches and bookings for international travel since the announcement that quarantine would be lifted have favoured short-haul international destinations, with Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan topping travel agency searches.

For many, however, the broader offerings of luxury goods overseas combined with the savings means shopping holidays are definitely back on the agenda - good news for Paris retailers.

Lucy Lu, 31-year-old who works in fashion in Shanghai, has already made her travel plans.

""The Bulgari ring my friend wants is 20% cheaper in Dubai and my other friend has given me a list of make-up, some products are often out of stock in China, so it's easier to get them abroad.""

The chemical class is a growing concern in fashion too, with period care underwear the latest to come under scrutiny.

More from WWD

As WWD reported, Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency held firm on its timeline to propose a PFAS drinking water standard. Through this proposal, the EPA is taking strides to protect an estimated 200 million Americans from PFAS pollution, leveraging the latest science and complementing state efforts to limit PFAS.

The proposed rule is undergoing interagency review, and then the EPA will open it for public comment. The proposal will require public water systems to monitor and regulate: PFOA and PFOS as individual contaminants, while regulating four other PFAS — PFNA, PFHxS, PFBS, and GenX Chemicals — as a mixture.

Everyone from lawmakers, activists to actors weighed in on the news. The agency anticipates finalizing the rule by the end of 2023 mobilizing upward of $10 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Returns: The British Fashion Council released a new report Tuesday together with DHL and consultancy firm Roland Berger on the environmental impact of fashion returns. It found that incorrect fit and lagging product quality were the top returns reasons in the U.K, and a returns charge is the most likely measure to prevent returns. Last year, U.K. clothing returns alone, with 23 million garments sent to landfill, created 750,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.

The report, which presents findings from phase two of BFC’s Institute of Positive Fashion’s inaugural Circular Fashion Ecosystem Project, outlined two target outcomes to minimize returns. Firstly, retailers have the responsibility to help consumers make the right choice. Secondly, retailers need to invest in reverse logistics to reduce costs and meet carbon emission targets.

Story continues

Siobhan Gehin, senior partner at Roland Berger, added that the circular fashion business, albeit harder to achieve, is estimated to grow 18 percent per year from where they were at the beginning of this decade to 2030, whereas the rest of the market is looking at just 3 percent annual growth.

Resale Moves: Ariat International is joining the growing resale movement.

The California-based company announced that it has partnered with resale tech company Archive to launch a secondhand marketplace for its products. The site, called Ariat Reboot, is powered by Archive’s digital platform, though it lives on the Ariat.com website. Initially, the product offerings will be limited to Ariat’s English and Western boots for men, women and kids, with more categories to be added in the future, such as work boots and apparel.

In more resale news, branded resale player Trove released its first platform-agnostic “Brand Resale Index” Tuesday. The five-month study, in collaboration with OSF Digital, included more than 40 brands — among them Patagonia, REI and Phillip Lim — weighted against 147 criteria, including marketing potential.

Patagonia was one of the top programs in terms of brand positioning of resale, adopting 78 percent of marketing best practices, funneling 10 percent of customers over to its “Worn Wear” resale site.

“Just because a model is resale doesn’t mean it’s good in the world,” said Andy Ruben, Trove’s founder. “Most of the resale marketing we see are riders or existing emails going out. [Resale] should absolutely mimic what regular marketing spend is for e-commerce.”

It’s the first time the government has relaxed its Zero-Covid policies since the start of the pandemic in 2020. Luxury brands are hoping to capitalize on Chinese tourists looking for revenge travel, but these shoppers may not be so quick to return to cities like Paris or Milan.

When the China’s lockdown was first put in place, it ended a wave of Chinese tourists visiting international capitals to splurge on designer brands. Before the viral outbreak in early 2020, Chinese shoppers bought 70 percent of their luxury goods abroad in tourist-driven destinations like Paris, Milan and New York. According to consultancy group Bain & Co., China will become the biggest luxury market in 2023—and many brands in the sector will be looking for eager Chinese tourists amid an expected financial downturn.

More from Robb Report

“Most luxury brands were bracing for a very steep V-shaped recovery in sales in mainland China after the end of the Shanghai and Beijing lockdowns, which affected the business in the spring,” Erwan Rambourg, global head of consumer and retail research at HSBC, told the New York Times. “Apart from Hermès and Moncler, who experienced strong growth in the market, the rest of the sector has seen very muted growth or— more commonly—no growth at all.”

However, a lot has changed since the start of the lockdown. Two years have passed and shopping habits have changed with it, including a domestic boom for the country’s luxury market, which doubled to $68 billion between 2019 to 2021. Local shopping destinations like Hainan have seen a sharp increase in visitors as well. The area accounted for 13 percent of the country’s domestic luxury spending—more than double its pre-pandemic figures.

While many international destinations have already relaxed their travel restrictions, many Chinese tourists are opting to stay within Asia. Among Chinese travelers, the top five destinations booked when the regulations fell were Singapore, Japan, Thailand, South Korea and Hong Kong. All of this has some industry analysts questioning whether Chinese shopping abroad will ever return to pandemic levels.

“It won’t go back to 70 percent,” Shanghai-based Jonathan Yan, a principal at consultancy Roland Berger told Reuters. “I’m sure there will still be a portion of luxury spending happening in other countries because it’s natural for people to shop when we travel, but it will be more like 50-50.”

Whether Chinese tourists will return to international destinations in the spring and summer remains to be seen. For their part, luxury brands in Europe and the US will be crossing their fingers.

While Luko isn’t disclosing terms of the deal, the company says it’s a 100% share deal, which means that Coya investors are now Luko investors. Those investors include Valar Ventures, Headline and Roland Berger’s family office.

Luko started as a home insurance company for both homeowners and renters. It’s a big market, as you have to prove that your home is insured when you rent or buy a home in France. Since then, the company has expanded with new insurance products and services.

Compared to traditional insurance companies, Luko has chosen a direct-to-customer model. People sign up on Luko’s website or in the company’s app directly.

After that, Luko tries to be as efficient as possible. You can chat with the company in the app directly. When the insurance pays you back, it tries to send you the money as quickly as possible. For instance, you can receive money instantly on a Lydia account.

When it comes to transparency, Luko takes a 30% cut on monthly payments. Everything else is pooled together to pay compensation. If there’s money left at the end of the year, you can choose to donate your portion of what’s left of the 70% share.

The startup has been quite successful. It has attracted 220,000 customers — in particular, the customer base has doubled between November 2020 and November 2021. Luko started accepting clients in Spain a few months ago, as well.

Coya, on the other hand, offers various insurance products for the German market. Insurance products include home content, private liability, dog liability and bike insurance.

Following today’s acquisition, Coya is going to be called Luko Insurance AG. Coya’s 80,000 clients are joining Luko’s customer base, which means that Luko now has 300,000 clients in total.

More importantly, Coya has obtained an insurance license in Germany. Luko is going to leverage that license across all its markets thanks to European passporting rules. This way, Luko controls a bigger chunk of the insurance stack.

Up next, Luko has ambitious goals as it plans to build a European leader in the insurtech startup space. The company plans to hire 100 new employees this year alone. By 2023, the startup wants to reach one million customers.",['Romain Dillet'],2022-01-19 00:00:00
https://www.kansascity.com/press-releases/article274231250.html,New Report by the Manufacturers Alliance Foundation and Roland Berger Identifies How Manufacturers Increase Competitiveness and Resilience,"Report features input from C-suite U.S. manufacturing industry leaders regarding the trends impacting their operations and how they are responding, and reveals an appetite to invest in strategic change











CHICAGO / ACCESSWIRE / April 12, 2023 / The U.S. manufacturing sector is experiencing disruptive change, and manufacturing leaders are moving exponentially faster and juggling more priorities than ever before. Among the most important issues impacting their operations, manufacturers rank digitalization and sustainability as top priorities. In the wake of supply chain challenges, and market preferences, among other factors, more companies are pursuing localization and reshoring to the Americas. Furthermore, as the pace of disruption has become the new benchmark for change in the manufacturing industry, leading-edge manufacturers continue to strategically invest and move forward. These are among the key findings in the new report by the Manufacturers Alliance Foundation and Roland Berger, ""Manufacturers Disrupting Themselves: Increased Competitiveness and Resiliency Through Next Generation Manufacturing.""

Manufacturers Alliance and Roland Berger conducted interviews and surveys with C-level leaders from dozens of manufacturing companies, primarily located in North America, in Q1 of this year. Survey respondents included subject matter experts in finance, strategy, and manufacturing operations.

""Now more than ever, manufacturers are recognizing that in order to move the needle, they must embrace next generation manufacturing trends, and proactively develop a pragmatic set of solutions that address today's global challenges,"" said Michelle Drew Rodriguez, Partner, Roland Berger. ""Through the report developed by Roland Berger and Manufacturers Alliance, our goal is to provide insights on how leading next-gen manufacturers are prioritizing and already activating each of these trends in their go-forward strategies, as well as how their best practices can help create a roadmap for other manufacturers looking to increase their own competitiveness and resiliency.""

Manufacturers Alliance Foundation President and CEO Stephen Gold noted, ""While manufacturing has faced years of disruption through a global pandemic, supply chain crisis, and threat of an economic downturn, to name a few, the pace of change continues to accelerate. Successful manufacturers continue to face these headwinds with innovation and an eye on long-term growth. This report highlights six megatrends manufacturing executives ignore at their own peril.""

Among the Key Findings in the Report:

Business model innovation has come to manufacturing

Following in the footsteps of other sectors, manufacturing is increasingly looking at business model innovation instead of strictly focusing on product innovation. Additional sources of growth include new solutions, differentiation through software, and novel services.

Digitalization is table stakes for competitiveness, and a prerequisite for sustainability

After many years of taking a 'wait-and-see' approach to digitalization, companies now realize digitalization is essential for them to succeed. Companies now rank digitalization (76%) and sustainability (72%) as the most relevant and important trends. There has been considerable investment uptick in both over the last two years, and manufacturers are investing and making progress in both areas with long-term goals in mind. The daunting nature of handling these two massive trends has been replaced by the realization that, when done right, they solve each other.

Reshoring and localization are gaining traction (and becoming a competitive advantage)

After decades of outsourcing, the idea of locating manufacturing within the market it serves is taking on new importance in wake of surging transportation costs, trade wars, geopolitical risk, the accelerated pace of climate events, and broken supply chains. More companies are pursuing or considering localization and reshoring; the U.S., Canada, and Mexico topped the list for intended destination for manufacturers surveyed. Among survey respondents, 52% stated they are implementing or expanding localization initiatives, and another 22% said they were piloting initiatives (with others limiting relocation to specific functions or products). A whopping 52% of manufacturers surveyed plan to build new facilities as part of their relocation strategy.

Technology leaders are much more likely to pursue lot-size-one or individualized manufacturing

Many manufacturers are pursuing local-for-local strategy based not only on the difficulty and cost of shipping a large product, but also because of local market preferences and the demand for specific functions.

Digitalization is playing an important role in the ability to deliver customized products, as well as the development of new products, solutions, and services. Customization initiatives and pilots are already being planned or are underway or expanding at 78% of companies; 34% of them are pursuing fully individualized manufacturing approaches, with the goal of lot-size-one (producing a single item) - the exact opposite of traditional mass production. Among companies that consider themselves to be early adapters, 54% are pursuing individualized manufacturing.

https://www.consultancy.uk/news/33996/digital-tools-and-return-charges-key-to-cut-uk-fashions-carbon-emissions,Digital tools and return charges key to cut UK fashion's carbon emissions,"As the UK struggles to meet its net zero targets, millions of returned fashion items are incinerated, generating thousands of tonnes of CO2 emissions every year. According to a new report, digital sizing tools and return charges could reduce fashion industry returns by more than half.

In late 2022, the British Fashion Council (BFC) announced it had commissioned global strategy consultants from Roland Berger, in partnership with DHL, to carry out a report that hopes to solve problems surrounding e-commerce returns in fashion. The initiative formed part of the BFC’s Institute of Positive Fashion (IPF), looking to recognise the importance of investigating in innovation to secure profitable businesses, while safeguarding the planet and society.

In a statement, BFC’s chief executive Caroline Rush said at the time, “We are delighted to work with Roland Berger to help find a solution to the direct and hidden costs and impact associated with returns in the UK.”

The report has now been published, and at a time when fashion retailers are struggling with heightened costs and falling custom, due to the continued inflation crisis gripping the economy, the findings make for striking reading. Roland Berger found that the UK fashion industry lost an estimated minimum of £7 billion in 2022, due to returns.

At the same time, when the industry is coming under intense scrutiny to reduce its carbon footprint, a significant amount of waste was generated from fashion returns that could not be resold. While most fashion items can be resold after complex processing, the study found approximately 3% of returns were never put back on sale. It is estimated that more than 50% of those unsold returns were sent to landfill, with another 25% are incinerated – while only the remaining 25% were being recycled. Each year, UK returns are therefore estimated to generate about 750,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions.

On top of the fact some fashion categories are producing as much as 15% too much output, with most of that ending up in landfill, this is simply not sustainable – financially, or ecologically. To that end, Roland Berger found that fashion retailers could deploy a blend of technology and customer service shifts – to radically reduce their returns, their impact on their purse, and the planet.

At present, size and fit are the biggest reasons for returns – with 91% of the consumers who returned items in the last three months citing it as a top cause, and 73% also noting bracketing size as an issue. When asked which methods retailers could deploy to help reduce this, three-quarters of shoppers said improved product descriptions could help, while 72% also said digital tools such as size calculators and a 360 view of goods could help. The majority of each age-group also said they would be willing to share digital size and fit details with brands to show how items would fit on their digital avatar. Even the most cautious group of over 41s saw 56% of consumers agree to this, while Millennials were most enthusiastic, at 74%.

Roland Berger calculated that large retailers with approximately 70% of sales coming from their website, could reduce cost of returns handling by 20-40% with the introduction of sizing calculators and avatars. At the same time, implementing stricter return policies, linked to environmental messaging, could also see the number of returns fall. While many firms offer free returns, 56% of shoppers told Roland Berger returns charges would incentivise them to keep products they ordered. At the same time, this could lead to obtaining new customers – with shoppers increasingly avoiding spending money with retailers whose sustainability credentials are poor.

Siobhan Gehin, a Senior Partner at Roland Berger, commented, “Tackling the returns issue is being prompted by lower consumption, impending legislation and higher operating costs – the latter probably being the strongest motivator for companies to move from a linear to a circular business model. While the future for fashion is circular, achieving it is not an easy task. The prize, though, is that circular fashion businesses are estimated to grow 18% per annum from where they were at the beginning of this decade to 2030, whereas the rest of the market is looking at just 3% annual growth.”",[],2023-04-17 05:04:00+00:00

While most of the work is currently being delivered in Europe, the international partnership is led out of Roland Berger’s Middle East practice.

A tiny place on the European map, the Swiss city of Zug (only 30,000 inhabitants) is a surprisingly big name on the global crypto stage. Home to many cryptocurrency companies, including unicorns Ethereum, Dfinity and Cardano, Zug has been dubbed a ‘Crypto Valley’ for its role at the front of the crypto and Web3 world.

Also headquartered in Zurg is Inacta, an IT firm that specialises in technology services, with a particular focus on digital assets and blockchain-based technologies. The firm has over the years helped the likes of AXA, InCore Bank, Swiss Post, Raiffeisen Bank and Visa explore and tap into the world of digital assets.

In the Middle East, Inacta is best known for its role in concepting and backing Dubai-based Crypto Oasis, the region’s fastest growing blockchain ecosystem. Crypto Oasis brings together stakeholders form across the landscape – startups, investors, corporates and service providers – with the aim of building winning formula’s and mutual partnerships.

When Inacta recently approached Crypto Oasis for support on its growing portfolio of Web3 projects, Crypto Oasis Co-Founder Saqr Ereiqat was quick to endorse Roland Berger, its exclusive global strategic partner and a firm that operates at the forefront of the crypto strategy consulting landscape.

This week, the companies inked a three-way deal. “We’re delighted to have orchestrated this partnership between our trusted partners,” said Ereiqat.

Led out of the Middle East by partner Pierre Samaties, Roland Berger’s Digital Assets, Web3 & Metaverse practice helps its clients build and implement crypto economy strategies. Adding weight to the international-oriented partnership with Inacta, Roland Berger also has teams of crypto experts across Europe, including Switzerland and Germany.

“Roland Berger is a thought leader among the top strategy consulting firms in the digital assets and Web3 space,” said Zug-based Ralf Glabischnig, Managing Partner and Founder of Inacta. “With this strategic partnership, we can combine Roland Berger’s strong consulting skills with our Web3 implementation power to better support our joint clients.”

The deal has been quick to materialise, with “a number of projects already in the works,” said Samaties. One of the projects is for German utility giant E.On, and another is for an unnamed pharma- and consumer goods giant based in Switzerland. “And we intend to closely cooperate on many more projects in the future.”

What distinguishes companies that are making rapid progress in digitalizing their manufacturing operations from those that are not? The new Roland Berger study on “The current state of Industry 4.0” has found that it is a combination of four factors: the clear prioritization of applications, the setup of a dedicated cross-functional Industry 4.0 team, the definition of a completely harmonized IT/OT target landscape and a strong focus on respective employee training. Drawing on the experiences of leading automotive OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers, the study presents the key success factors for digital manufacturing.

“When the term ‘Industry 4.0′ was coined a good ten years ago, there were immense hopes around it,” says Bernhard Langefeld, Partner at Roland Berger. “In the meantime, companies have in some cases invested a lot of money, but most of them are still far away from the original vision of an intelligent, fully flexible and self-organizing factory.”

Digital manufacturing often fails in practice owing to circumstances such as largely autonomously operating production sites with heterogeneous IT/OT architectures, the use of outdated equipment, or difficulties quantifying the added value of Industry 4.0 use cases. In spite of these challenges, the automotive industry in particular has made significant progress in Industry 4.0 in recent years. The consultants’ analysis based on the experiences of leading manufacturers and suppliers shows that to drive the identification, prioritization and implementation of use cases, the digital pioneers rely on organizational setups that efficiently enable a centralized (hub-and-spoke) approach to solution development. This avoids the same work having to be repeated at different company facilities. Not only that, but the resulting processes are easier to roll out and scale up across multiple plants if there is one central body in control.

Organization and technology are crucial

The implementation of individual use cases requires competency in data analysis, IT and production. That is why successful OEMs normally bundle their digital activities on a cross-functional basis in an Industry 4.0 center of excellence. Working in close coordination with the plants, this central team will determine the concrete requirements and pilot new applications. To manage the various specific implementations, companies also need an overarching IT/OT target architecture. This is where IIoT-based cloud platforms are becoming increasingly important. This target landscape helps to avoid the redundant buildup of IT infrastructure and interfaces for different use cases, and ensures that the use case implementation roadmap is aligned with the investment in new systems.

The study found that the automotive industry has achieved considerable success in recent years:

Condition monitoring and predictive maintenance of plant and machinery are already at an advanced stage of technical maturity.

Vision-based and process data-based inspections come with high value added across different use cases, from engine production to final assembly.

Autonomous material handling is used particularly in intralogistics for engine and vehicle assembly.

Modern track and trace systems support the tracking of transports along the supply chain, helping to achieve greater process transparency and facilitating the seamless tracking of incoming parts.

In-process (real-time) machine optimization displays the lowest degree of technical maturity. There are currently some initial pilot use cases in press and paint shops.

Aulbur is slated to speak on the global economy and its impact on the commercial vehicle aftermarket. He has extensive global experience, having led Roland Berger’s India Practice and served as head of the Automotive Practice for Asia. He also served as chairman of Roland Berger Middle East and Africa. Prior to his work with Roland Berger, Aulbur held several management positions for a leading global OEM in the passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle side of the business across the U.S., Europe, and India.

HDAD ‘23 is co-presented by HDMA and MacKay & Company and will immediately precede Heavy Duty Aftermarket Week 2023. HDAD is traditionally held as a conference, networking, and kick-off for suppliers attending HDAW. The upcoming program will be themed “Resiliently Transforming the Future.”

HDAD brings together thought leaders from all segments of the heavy-duty aftermarket industry who can share applied knowledge on the state of the marketplace and what steps are necessary to be sustainable and prosperous as the industry evolves. Right now, other HDAD topics include:

2023 outlook: Operational resilience among mixed economic signals

Disruptions to the global economy are occurring more often and with greater impact than ever before, and the instability isn’t likely to change, said Giovanni Schelfi, partner at global consultancy firm Roland Berger.

The disruptions to the economy, and in turn the commercial vehicle market, are driven in part by geopolitical alignments, such as the war in Ukraine and assertive policies in China, as well as climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic and structural issues in the global supply chain, Schelfi said as part of a global economic and geopolitical overview during the Heavy Duty Aftermarket Dialogue outlook conference held on Jan. 16 in Grapevine, Texas.

The war in Ukraine, for example, hinders access to key raw materials, has led to distortions of global energy markets and resulted in significant cost increases, particularly in Europe, Schelif said. If current conditions persist, Roland Berger predicts a shift of sites and jobs elsewhere, even North America.

“Volatility is actually the new normal,” Schelfi said. “I think the times where we could do a 10-year strategic plan, and be fairly confident about being correct… these times are over with.”

Decline in Global Growth

Roland Berger expects a decline in global growth in 2023. The latest inflation numbers and labor market data are comparable to those during the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, Schelfi said.

While supply chain challenges were often considered short- and mid-term issues, that’s not the case now. Supply chain disruption is often driven by macro factors and could thus lead to longer term challenges. Furthermore, the current structural demand versus supply imbalance and logistics cost inflation are unlikely to disappear quickly. Inflation could continue to be a problem for the next two to five years, and beyond, Schelfi said. If this is the case, the cost of goods is going to be higher, especially in the West.

Impact of Shifting Focus from ICEs to ZEVs

Supply chain concentration is likely going to be a larger challenge for internal combustion engines as the global supplier landscape contracts with zero-emission vehicles on the horizon. This could have an impact on the industry for five years or more, Roland Berger predicts. This is because global focus on building out the ZEV supply chain will reduce supplier capacity and availability for commercial vehicle OEMs over time.",[],
https://www.consultancy-me.com/news/5931/hani-tohme-roland-berger-on-the-circular-economy-transition,Hani Tohme (Roland Berger) on the circular economy transition,"The fairly new concept of a circular economy – supported by green financing – is fast gaining importance given the current global developments, including the many global warming events being witnessed particularly in the last few months across all corners of the globe.

“In our fight against climate change, we tend to ignore circularity and focus on carbon-dioxide emissions,” says Hani Tohme, senior partner at Roland Berger in the Middle East.

“However, the impact of circularity is estimated at 45% on climate impact. Safeguarding resources is our first step to ensure that all national commitments towards climate change are met. A good example is the delay in manufacturing of windmills due to the scarcity of rare earth material. This tells us that circular economy is a prerequisite that we can't ignore,” he adds.

“Moreover, circular economy is a concept that brings together ecology and economy – as such, businesses would take it more seriously as they would still meet their traditional key performance indicators (KPIs) of profitability and achieving the desired internal rates of return (IRRs) while meeting the planet's KPIs.”

The circular economy model is based on giving organic material back to the earth and the non-organic material back to the industry. It is about closing the loop and avoiding creating true ‘waste’. In order to do that, people have to think of industries as a whole and not as silos. There is a need to create the link between the manufacturer, the seller, the transporter and the recycler.

Achieving circularity

According to Tohme, there are three fundamentals that need to be achieved for circularity:

Change the design taking the end of life of products into consideration,

Change the concept of ownership, allowing manufacturers and original owners of products to stay close to their material,

Change the concept of material flow, allowing products to be looped back into the industry or earth.

A circular economy can be an instrument to tackle issues such as resource scarcity, climate change, and the problem of pollution. And there are some key building blocks of a circular economy.

“To achieve circularity, you would need to rethink the current status quo to enable economic and ecological savings,” says Tohme. For this to happen, he asserts that the world would have to:

Rethink the design to better assess what product to use to limit waste at the end of the life-cycle; what technology to use, making sure the most efficient and the least energy-consuming one is selected; what source of energy to use, ensuring it has the least impact on the environment; and, in many cases, the best financial impact on the business, and so on.

Rethink the ownership, understanding who is responsible for the product consumption and disposal, how to raise awareness to limit the unnecessary consumption and improve reuse levers, and who will take care of it, etc.

Rethink the transportation, or to make the wise decision on collection and transportation, leveraging latest clean fuel sources (from waste, from agri-sources, from hydrogen and carbon), and maximising digitalisation to streamline routes and itineraries, thereby reducing redundancy.

Rethink the material flow, instating the correct waste management fundamentals to assess how to treat each waste stream; which technology is best to use based on the existing market characteristics; and what regulations need to be in place to enable appropriate treatment, reduce resources scarcity, and eliminate pollution.

For measuring the progress towards the building of a circular economy, different metrics can be set to track the progress such as the share of recycled materials in the raw material sourcing, share of clean energy used in production, share of clean fuel for transportation, recovered and recycled material rate, landfill diversion on a country level. All these factors need to be considered in the product life-cycle assessment.

Fundamental shifts

“Having said that, a circular economy is based on creating fundamental shifts in the behaviour and the way industries operate and therefore can't be seen as the short-term impact. An analogy that is often used is when you place your kids in school, you don't expect that they start generating a return the next year,” says Tohme.

“Instead, you would hope that after 18-20 years, your kids would be well positioned to become effective in society and, among other activities, they would be having a good and impactful job. Businesses have always been short-sighted, driven by monthly stock price or yearly budgets,” he adds.

“We have to break that thinking and focus on the long-term sustainability of businesses.”

Green financing

As for the new field of green financing, Tohme says that it can be defined simply as financial instruments where proceeds are used for green projects only. The main purpose of green debt is to address climate-change mitigation, natural resources depletion, loss of biodiversity and air, water and soil pollution.

Several standard financial instruments are currently used to finance green projects. This includes bonds, loans, sukuks (an Islamic financial certificate similar to a bond), and carbon market instruments.

“Industries have been built with the industrial era in mind. The more you produce, the better; the higher the profit, the better. Industries are not taking into account the indirect impact of their work on the environment.”

“When green financing is introduced, new KPIs that matter become a priority to the chief executive officers and the C-suite in general. Green financing would therefore shift behaviours to help economy in meeting ecology, as they are complementary rather than opposite.”

For example, in the waste management sector, green financing is being explored as a means to pay for waste treatment and recycling efforts. However, many of the waste management activities and recycling efforts are not financially sustainable when compared to raw material production and subsidised sectors.

Tohme: “When the financial viability in its current definition is not met, businesses and investors are not excited to push for best practices and would instead consider sustainable investments as corporate social responsibility, killing the true purpose of circularity.”

The ultimate objective of sustainable financing is to lower the bar to make the right and responsible decisions and to raise the bar for other polluting activities.

Roland Berger

The firm that Tohme works for, Roland Berger, acknowledges that sustainability is a prerequisite for any sector to thrive and to exist in the coming years. As such, it has created a dedicated competence centre for sustainability but, more importantly, ensured that every sector it addresses embeds the fundamentals of sustainability, climate change and circularity.

“Through our work, we impact decisions made at national levels, in board rooms and on the shop floors. We therefore recognise the responsibility we have in shaping the mindset of the decision-makers. Our projects cover defining new sustainable strategies, rethinking the portfolio and operating model, developing countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), developing environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategies, conducting mergers and acquisitions to expand the sustainable offering – and the list goes on.”

Tohme says that focusing on sustainability gives him the satisfaction of supporting businesses as well as contributing to the future planet which his children and grandchildren will inherit.

“Being exposed to topics such as waste management, where 50 per cent of the world's resources are still being landfilled, or water management, where our most precious resource is being polluted and wasted, gives me the urge to be fully invested in making a change.”

https://hydrogen-central.com/unlocking-hydrogen-growth-middle-east-roland-berger/,Unlocking Hydrogen Growth in The Middle East,"Unlocking hydrogen growth in the middle east – Roland Berger.

The Middle East is uniquely positioned to become a frontrunner region in the future low carbon hydrogen economy. Investing in the creation and development of a sustainable hydrogen ecosystem can make the Middle East a leading producer of low carbon hydrogen and a major exporter to Europe and North-East Asia.

Nonetheless, several challenges still stand in the way of achieving these ambitions, many of them related to the lack of infrastructure, strategies, and regulations. In this publication we outline the key challenges and identify key enablers to drive the low carbon hydrogen ecosystem forward.

Hydrogen – An opportunity for Middle Eastern Countries

The Middle East is uniquely positioned to become a future export hub of green hydrogen. Not only does it benefits from abundant resources to produce low carbon hydrogen at a large scale, but it is also well located to export hydrogen to major demand centers in Western Europe and North-East Asia.

While there is a lot of interest in the Middle East’s potential of becoming a hydrogen powerhouse and despite the high number of hydrogen projects announced in the region, a comprehensive strategy has not been announced yet, even though most countries are in the midst of defining their strategies.

Key challenges need to be addressed to enable the development of the future hydrogen economy

If well informed national strategies are set and executed, the Middle East can see a boom in large-scale hydrogen projects, an expansion of hydrogen valleys, and a decline in production costs. It can further become a leader in advanced R&D activities and hydrogen innovations, and in setting international best practices and standards.

https://www.consultancy.eu/news/8467/roland-berger-adds-team-of-german-restructuring-consultancy-candidus,Roland Berger adds team of German restructuring consultancy Candidus,"Roland Berger has strengthened its restructuring and performance improvement capabilities in home market Germany with the time hire of Candidus, a 13-strong consultancy from Munich.

Founded in 2003, Candidus specialises in a range of management consulting services, including operations management, finance and restructuring. The award-winning firm works for medium-sized enterprises.

For Roland Berger, Candidus came on its radar in particular for its expertise in restructuring, turnaround and interim chief restructuring officer services – a segment that is seeing booming demand as a growing number of companies enter the zone of financial distress or even insolvency proceedings.

“We are delighted to expand our restructuring and turnaround consulting services,” said Sascha Haghani, leader of Roland Berger’s Restructuring, Performance & Transaction practice in the DACH region.

With Candidus’ team coming on board, the bolt-on also sees Roland Berger expand its network of interim chief restructuring officers, who are typically externally appointed by companies to lead them through special or crisis situations. “Our offering to take over board functions in special situations such as complex restructuring, carve-outs, post-merger integration or financial distress is experiencing significant growth,” said Haghani.

This line of business sees Roland Berger shift from its traditional strategy consultant remit, to a more in-house executive role. “In such special or crisis situations, our clients not only expect us to develop new concepts, but also to help lead and implement them,” Haghani explained.

In this segment, Roland Berger faces stiff competition from the well-known restructuring houses such as AlixPartners, Alvarez & Marsal, and FTI Consulting (trading as FTI/Andersch in Gemany), as well as local boutiques.

Roland Berger is not alone in expanding its interim chief restructuring officer service – other leading strategy consultancies are making similar moves, with McKinsey & Company, Bain & Company and Boston Consulting Group for instance all recently hiring well-known restructuring specialists in Germany.

According to a recent benchmark by the Scientific Society for Management Consulting (WGMB) among 700+ insolvency experts, Roland Berger however has remained Germany’s most reputable restructuring consultancy, ahead of (in order of ranking) AlixPartners, Alvarez & Marsal, McKinsey & Company, Boston Consulting Group and Bain & Company.

“The competition between the large consulting firms active in the restructuring space is intensifying,” said Dietmar Fink, director of WGMB. “The recent developments in the market have created a whole new competitive situation.”

Globally, Roland Berger has approximately 3,000 employees in 50+ offices worldwide. In 2022, the firm grew by 15% to hit revenues of €850 million – the highest level since its inception in 1967 by namesake Roland Berger.

A small part of this growth was driven by inorganic growth. In August 2022, Roland Berger acquired PolarixPartner, a consultancy specialised in cost optimisation.",[],2023-02-03 14:21:00+00:00
https://www.consultancy.eu/news/7891/roland-berger-buys-30-strong-german-manufacturing-consultancy,Roland Berger buys 30-strong German manufacturing consultancy,"In its first acquisition in three years, Roland Berger has picked up POLARIXPARTNER, a management consultancy with a team of around 30 staff in Germany.

Hot on the heels of Stefan Schaible’s growth-focused unveilings in Manager Magazin, Roland Berger has announced its first deal in 35 months.

The CEO of Roland Berger admitted that the strategy and management consulting firm is working towards an ambitious growth agenda, aimed at hitting €1 billion in revenues in the coming years (up from nearly €750 million today), with inorganic growth an integral part of the drive.

Kicking off its deal agenda is POLARIXPARTNER, a Saarburg-based player specialised in strategy development, product teardown, value engineering, and cost and process optimisation in manufacturing-oriented sectors such as automotive, medical technology, pharmaceutical, aerospace, and plant engineering.

The deal comes on the back of a period of collaboration between the two firms, in particular around technical cost optimisation projects in Germany. “POLARIXPARTNER strengthens Roland Berger’s value chain and broad services portfolio,” said Marcus Berret, Global Managing Director at Roland Berger.

“They not only complement us operationally, but we also share the same philosophy – we deliver measurable results to clients and help them manage the major transformations of our time. The joining of forces is a natural fit, combining unparalleled industry expertise, European heritage and a global mindset.”

For POLARIXPARTNER, the merger into Roland Berger means the firm will be able to tap into a network of 2,700+ staff worldwide, and combine with one of the leading manufacturing consultancies in the marketplace.

CEO Markus Wiederstein: “Roland Berger is the only European voice among the major international management consulting firms, so the ideal partner for us. They will boost our offerings and help open the door to new markets.”

Turning to deals is a rare move for Roland Berger, although that is rumoured to change in the years ahead. According to Consultancy.org’s M&A database, the firm only closed two deals in the past decade: Enovation in the United States (2019) and FMC Consultants in Germany (2015).

Meanwhile, Roland Berger has on multiple occasions successfully fended off hostile merger attacks from rivals, including coming an inch close to being absorbed by a Big Four firm in 2013.",[],2022-08-01 09:26:00+00:00
https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/roland-berger-automotive-disruption-radar-electric-vehicle-boom-undeterred-by-economic-downturn/,Roland Berger: Automotive Disruption Radar: Electric vehicle boom undeterred by economic downturn,"Share of electric vehicle sales in ADR countries rises to 13.2 percent

Electric vehicle sales continue to rise, despite challenging economic times with increasing inflation and energy prices. According to Roland Berger’s latest “Automotive Disruption Radar” (ADR 12), the share of electric vehicles in the analyzed countries is up to an all-time high of 13.2 percent – almost twice the share from the previous 12 months (6.9 percent) and quadrupling since ADR8 in 2020 (3.3 percent). The twice-yearly report, which tracks 26 automotive indicators across 22 countries, also signals a shift away from traditional ownership models. Interest in car-as-a-service (CaaS) models has increased by 11 percent since 2019.

“The recent economic challenges for the automotive industry, caused by the pandemic, supply chain issues and the shortage on semiconductors, have not slowed down the push towards electrification,” says Stefan Riederle, Partner at Roland Berger. “For example, in China, which had production stops as a result of Covid lockdowns, the electric vehicle sales are up to 23 percent. As governments in more and more countries are introducing regulation and restrictions on internal combustion engines, this trend will only continue.”

Appetite for mobility sees Singapore surge ahead

A top three finisher in previous editions of the ADR, Singapore leap-frogged both China and the Netherlands to secure the top position for the first time. The city-state performed especially well on mobility indicators, with 15 percent of the distance traveled by Singaporeans being via demand-driven modes (car sharing, ride-hailing, etc.) and 46 percent via public transport.

Previous ranking leader China drops down to second place but remains the most enthusiastic about electric vehicles. As many as 90 percent of buyers said they would consider an EV for their next vehicle purchase. Due to ongoing supply chain issues in Europe, ADR10 leader the Netherlands continue their slide down the ranking into third position, where they are joined by Norway. The Scandinavian country recorded by far the highest number of EV sales of any nation – 76 percent of new car sales in the country are all-electric, PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid EV) or FCEV (Fuel Cell EV). The next best performer in that category is Sweden, with 47 percent.

Mobility bounces back as Covid fears subside

Demand for mobility solutions, such as ride hailing, e-scooters, and public transport, crumbled during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic but is on the rise again – in some cases even exceeding pre-pandemic levels – as fears of infection ease. The latest ADR survey found that 65 percent of the respondents know at least one person who gave up a private car in favor of alternative transport modes, compared to 55 percent in 2020. This sentiment is particularly strong in India, Singapore and Indonesia.

Demand for flexibility boosts the popularity of CaaS models

There is a growing trend towards all-inclusive CaaS models, as consumers turn away from traditional purchase or leasing options in favor of flexible subscription models. More than half (56 percent) of car buyers indicated they would consider a CaaS model, while 45 percent said they would be willing to pay a 20 percent premium on equivalent leasing rates for the sake of flexibility.

“Consumer habits are changing and customers, especially in the younger generations, are becoming more inclined to sign up to subscription models that provide convenience and flexibility,” says Riederle. “It is important that OEMs adapt to this trend by offering more flexible payment solutions and comprehensive car-as-a-service options.”

The leadership change sees Hani Tohme and Santiago Castillo together lead a team of 20 partners and nearly 300 employees across five offices in the region: Dubai, Doha, Beirut, Manama and Riyadh.

Active in the region for over two decades, Roland Berger is one of the world’s leading strategic consultancies, and one of only two top ten strategy consulting players of European origin. The firm was founded in Germany in 1967, and today operates with 50+ offices in 30+ countries.

“Stepping into the role of Managing Partner is an exciting new journey filled with challenges and opportunities. Hani and I are excited to put our experience and expertise to work in order to help Roland Berger continue to achieve tremendous success and development by supporting our clients and the region,” said Tohme and Castillo on their new challenge.

Both have been with Roland Berger in the Middle East for almost ten years, driving their respective practices – Tohme specialises in sustainability (focus on sectors such as waste management and water utilities) while Castillo leads the automotive and mobility offerings (with a secondary focus on the technology and telecom sectors).

“I have worked closely with Hani and Santi for many years and I believe they are the perfect match to co-lead the company and take it to the next level,” said Seyger, who looks back at a spectacular time in the top seat. Under his leadership, Roland Berger more than quadrupled in size, from around 65 employees when he arrived five years ago from the firm’s Dutch practice to its current size.

In the process, Seyger also helped Roland Berger augment its profile in the region to mirror its global standing.

Seyger remains with the consulting firm, and will transition to the role of Chairman for the Middle East, tasked with overseeing the company’s strategic direction.

“Rene has been an exceptional Managing Partner, who consistently ensured our tremendous growth and close relationships with our clients, as well as within the company itself. We are grateful to his guidance over the years and look forward to continuing to work closely with him,” said Tohme and Castillo.

The transition to a co-CEO governance is quite uncommon among tier-1 strategy consultancies, with some notable exceptions. Growth-focused consultancy Simon-Kucher (which has a small presence in the Middle East) has been led globally by a duo since 2019, while AlixPartners in 2021 installed co-CEOs for Asia.

Roland Berger’s appointment comes within months of rivals McKinsey & Company (Hasan Muzaffar) and Boston Consulting Group (Pablo Martinez) also appointing new leaders for their Middle East division. Peers Bain & Company, Oliver Wyman and Strategy& are led by Tom De Waele, and longtimers Pedro Oliveira and George Sarraf, respectively.",[],2023-03-01 05:05:00+00:00

“With COP28 ahead and the major sustainability transformation sweeping through the region, the timing for Darren to join our team couldn’t have been better,” kicked off Rene Seyger, Managing Partner of Roland Berger in the Middle East.

From its four offices in the Middle East, Roland Berger advises a multitude of government and private sector organisations on how they can make their operations more sustainable, and adopt circular economy principles into their way of working.

In the waste management space, Roland Berger’s is one of the more established consultancies. Led by senior partner Hani Tohme in the region, the firm’s waste management team has advised several industry players with strategic and organisational transformations, including scaling-up to meet growing demand, reducing waste and emissions through recycling, and more.

In light of sustainability’s growing weight in boardroom agenda’s, a development accelerated in the region with both COP27 and COP28 taking place on Middle Eastern soil, Tohme said demand for waste-related sustainability services is more critical than ever. “Our clients need to ensure to integrate sustainability into their whole value chain, and establish a culture to secure competitiveness in the new, sustainable economy of tomorrow.”

“At Roland Berger, we help our clients turn their pledges into action and transform their business and operating models.” An expert in the waste landscape, Perrin adds extensive technical knowhow that “complements our strategic consulting approach,” said Tohme.

Perrin joins the strategy consultancy from Ricardo Energy and Environment, where he was Head of Business Development, Growth and Strategy for the Waste Management vertical. Earlier, he served environmental group Eunomia and spent a decade at engineering consultancy Jacobs.

During his career, he has delivered a range of waste strategy and implementation projects in segments such as waste collection, treatment systems and circular economy, across four continents (Europe, Asia, Middle East, and Australasia).

“I am very excited to be joining such a large and diverse strategic company that is aligned to my own personal vision of helping to create a sustainable future and leave the world in a better place than we entered it. It already feels like I am amongst a family of passionate individuals who are inspired to have a positive impact on the world,” said Perrin.

“As a keen problem solver, I look forward to building on over twenty years of strategic focused consulting in waste and resource management acquiring new skills and delivering new challenges.”",[],2023-01-23 13:43:00+00:00

Twice a year, all partners of Roland Berger find their way to the firm’s global meeting, with leadership appointments one of the key topics on the agenda (alongside topics such as strategy, acquisitions, and investments).

The latest meeting was one of the firm’s most joyful in years, following 15% growth in 2022 to hit record revenues of €850 million. While the Middle East represents a quite small part of that stake, the region is among the fastest growing units – which in turn culminated into the region taking home more than a quarter of all partner-level appointments.

In Europe, Roland Berger appointed six partners and senior partners, in Asia four were elevated, and in the Middle East, Arvind CJ and Mario Sanchez joined the partnership, while veteran partners Michael Caracache and Vatche Kourkejian were made senior partner.

The Dutchman Rene Seyger, Managing Partner of Roland Berger in the Middle East, said that he is extremely proud of the recognition, both for the Middle East team as well as for the four individuals. “2022 was an excellent year of growth for us, globally and in the Middle East. We’ve exceeded our expected growth in the region.”

“After such an excellent performance of the team in 2022, the whole management team is extremely pleased to see the professional developments of all our colleagues,” he added, noting that the firm promoted a record number of consultants across its ranks, including five to principal level.

The new principals are: Laurids Aigner, Taha Benali, Niklas Jovy, Alejandro Longueira Ramirez and Borja Velayos.

https://www.aftermarketnews.com/clepa-roland-berger-reveal-results-of-vehicle-electrification-study/,"CLEPA, Roland Berger Reveal Results of Vehicle Electrification Study","The ongoing electrification transition in the automotive sector indicates a massive change for the European aftermarket. The reasons: Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have around 30% lower demand for traditional aftermarket components and BEV sales forecasts project a 53 to 82% market share in 2030. These are the findings of a joint study by Roland Berger and CLEPA, the European Association of Automotive Suppliers. The authors have formulated three future scenarios and recommend steps the industry can take to shape the transformation.

“For automotive aftermarket players, planning for the transition to electrification is a very complex business because many vehicles in our fleet will still have an internal combustion engine after 2035,” says Hasmeet Kaur, partner at Roland Berger. “Even though electric vehicles currently make up only 0.8% of the vehicle parc, players need to reposition themselves now to ensure their success going forward.”

The automotive industry has been undergoing a rapid transformation for several years now. A combination of technology trends, changing customer behavior, the various supply shortages and the proposed regulation of the European Union (EU), which only recently was agreed on by the EU council, have put companies under pressure. Electrification is expected to massively impact the forces at play in the aftermarket.

The EV transition is underway: Outlook for 2030 and 2035

The study authors developed three scenarios and in each of them calculated the effects of the different pace of electrification on the automotive aftermarket. The most bullish scenario (Radical Electrification) sees electric mobility making a rapid breakthrough. This causes the share of battery-electric vehicles in total new vehicles below 3.5 tons sales to rise to 82% in 2030 and reach 100% from 2035 onwards.

The middle scenario (Ambitious Transformation) is based on the policy and corporate goals as they currently stand. In it, prices for the raw materials needed to manufacture batteries stabilize, and a suitable charging infrastructure is established. As a result, the share of electric cars in total vehicle sales grows to 68% by 2030 and hits 100% from 2035 onwards.

In the least progressive scenario (Regulatory Compliance), progress towards BEV-only is moderated by various headwinds, including rising battery raw material costs. The share of electric cars in total vehicle sales rises to 53% in 2030 and 96% in 2035, before reaching 99% in 2040.

Drop in demand for traditional drivetrains and engines

The increased market penetration of battery-electric vehicles will change both the importance of the various product categories in the aftermarket and the roles of the companies that operate in it. The authors analyzed 250 components along 53 vehicle systems and expect battery-electric vehicles to offer about 30% lower sales potential for traditional aftermarket components, compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. The reasons: battery-electric vehicles are built with fewer components and there is less wear and tear on the engine, the drivetrain and the brake components, among others.

For each of these components, the study estimates the impact, both negative and positive, on “gross” demand on the aftermarket (excluding additional demand for new components and services, such as labor in workshops or software updates). In order to show the impact of electrification clearly, the study specifically excludes other macro factors such as the impact of the expected overall growth of the vehicle parc or inflation, and technical trends such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. In the Radical Electrification scenario, a drop of 12% by 2035 and 17% by 2040 is forecasted. The product categories most affected are the internal combustion engine and the drivetrain, where demand will fall by 49 and 51%, respectively. In the Regulatory Compliance scenario, the impact is expected to be reduced to -13% by 2040.

New opportunities for industry players across the board

Electrification also opens up new opportunities along the value chain for the various suppliers in the industry. Parts manufacturers, for example, can shift their portfolio to battery-specific components but also expand their business model by remanufacturing or refurbishing components. A further opportunity is to offer diagnostics and flashing solutions to support workshops, particularly with the challenging software and data management of battery-electric vehicles with new electronics and connectivity platforms. Partnering with 3 battery specialists can help both the traditional aftermarket supplier and the battery specialist.

“It will be especially important for aftermarket players to develop remanufacturing and repairing capabilities for battery systems, electric motors, e-axles and power electronics,” says Frank Schlehuber, Senior Consultant Market Affairs at CLEPA. “We expect to see a shift in aftermarket services from hardware to software. Preventive maintenance will also gain relevance, given that the battery is safety-critical.”

Wholesale distributors will be able to assist in the management of end-of-life components, becoming providers of recycled materials or offering their logistics networks to new customer groups. And workshops have the option of positioning themselves as battery electric vehicle specialists and offering services to generalist workshops in their area. They can also offer their services to OEMs looking for IAM workshop partners to strengthen their service network.

Shopping festivals are evolving from discounting drives into an opportunity for brands to connect with new consumers and build a loyal fan base.

The 11.11 Global Shopping Festival, also known as Single’s Day in China, is the biggest retail event of them all and brands prepare months in advance to perfect their campaigns.

Traditionally conservative luxury brands are embracing online shopping in droves as the user experience improves in strides and e-commerce takes an increasingly larger share of total retail sales. In China, digitally native consumers expect a seamless shopping experience whenever and wherever they want to shop.

Luxury brands, such as Italy’s Brunello Cucinelli and Hungary’s Nanushka, recently made e-commerce in China a core plank of their international expansion.

In this episode of Alicast, Kathy Jiang, Principal & Chief Researcher at global consultancy Roland Berger talks with Alizila’s Managing Editor, Alison Tudor-Ackroyd, about how luxury brands can maximize their investment in 11.11 to attract Chinese consumers.

“11.11 has already become the key moment for Chinese consumers to think about what to add to their shopping cart,” said Shanghai-based Jiang, so brands need a carefully crafted strategy.

Top tips include making best use of virtual and augmented reality – but don’t rush it as too abrupt a rollout could disrupt consumers’ perception of the brand.

Munich-headquartered consultancy Roland Berger has published two white papers on luxury trends in China this year in collaboration with Alibaba Group, China’s largest e-commerce platform.

It believes that luxury brands concluded en masse this year that digitalizing luxury goods will not dilute their DNA. Instead, harnessing advanced technology can promote brand building and further strengthen their image.

The consultancy discovered that in China, only about 4% of luxury consumers complete their purchases through offline channels alone as most choose goods online and then buy them offline. Even this is changing as online infrastructure speeds up the shopping journey.

Podcast transcript:

You’re listening to Alicast, a deep dive into innovative and emerging trends in e-commerce, online payments and digital entertainment.

Alison Tudor-Ackroyd: Thank you Kathy for joining us today!

Kathy Jiang: Thank you Alison for inviting me to Alicast. It’s a great pleasure.

Alison Tudor-Ackroyd: How would you say the luxury market in China is evolving vis-à-vis the rest of the world?

Kathy Jiang: The luxury market here is evolving rapidly, and China will continue to lead its growth in the future based on our analysis.

Due to the impact of politics, macro environment and post-epidemic [elements], luxury consumption has some turbulence. However, the growth rate of Chinese luxury consumption will remain in a leading position.

It stands out as the benchmark, leading the global luxury industry in business innovation, as represented by Alibaba’s Tmall Luxury Pavilion.

Many of the leading luxury giants here in China set up good practices before the pandemic. For example, digitalization and the direct-to-consumer transformation helped them realize the value of online channels and the complementary nature of online and offline.

So we stay very positive and forward-looking.

Alison Tudor-Ackroyd: You did mention the turbulence created by the pandemic. Could you tell us more about how that impacted luxury spending and how luxury companies are positioning themselves to capture that post-pandemic rebound?

Kathy Jiang: Thanks to digitalization in previous years, we have already seen that many luxury giants utilize digital touchpoints to maintain persistent interactions with clients.

[They] communicated directly through social feeds to stay active, even during the most challenging time.

Now, on the way back to normal, we see that online luxury consumption is growing rapidly. Chinese online sales’ share of luxury in fashion retail is still growing in double-digits, even since the pandemic. The online purchasing channel is diversifying. Our data from 2017 to 2021 shows that luxury goods’ online retail sales share had a CAGR of 13.1%. Looking forward, we can say that online shares will still grow aggressively.

Alison Tudor-Ackroyd: Digging into those figures, other consultants have predicted that online shopping will take a larger share of the pie, up to 40%. Is that right?

Kathy Jiang: Overall, the [online share] number in China markets, especially for general apparel and fashion, is far beyond the global average – up to 35% to 40%. For the luxury [category], there is still some room and some gap versus general consumer goods.

Alison Tudor-Ackroyd: Will digitalizing luxury goods not dilute the DNA of luxury brands? People want to feel that luxury is exclusive, don’t you agree? And is that why traditionally luxury brands have been reluctant to move online?

Kathy Jiang: That’s a very good question. There is fierce debate.

Currently already up to 200 brands are already on Tmall Luxury Pavilion. We think the role of the online [channel] has already changed a lot. Now online is not only the new traffic gate but also a very good platform for brand building.

We still think that luxury clients need to be very clear about their brand message and assets, and sustainably invest in their communications directly to the consumers.

However, we see that consumers are becoming more changeable.

They’re looking for something fresh, even adventure. It means that traditional luxury clients need to be very open-minded to embrace the clients [by] using the correct social interaction. So that’s how to stay agile and echo new consumer trends while staying loyal to their brand genes. In the digital area, luxury goods need to be sustainable, staying true to yourself but trying to interact with your consumers – learn from them and grow with them.

Alison Tudor-Ackroyd: That’s very good advice. Thank you. I read the first white paper you wrote in collaboration with Alibaba, and it had some interesting insights into the shopping habits of luxury consumers in China. Could you briefly tell the audience about these personality archetypes that you have observed active in China?

Kathy Jiang: We have categorized six groups of consumer segments based on our study.

For example, we had the stereotype that luxury clients have a high income. But now, we not only observe some groups like the “trend-setters” who are very focused on taste and style and pursue spiritual pleasure to [pursue] a high-quality lifestyle.

We also figured out some emerging new trends of “active youth”. Those people are young and pursuing health and happiness for a more casual and natural life. Still, they like to investigate what to purchase with a sense of responsibility, cost-effectiveness and comfort. They’re also looking for something sustainable.

Alison Tudor-Ackroyd: Great stuff. I’d like to look closely at the “trend-setters” archetype you discussed. As I understand, that is the fastest growing and has the highest penetration.

Kathy Jiang: Those people have a large age scope ranging from 18 to 39. They are mainly females living in the first and second-tier cities, single, senior, middle class, and [coming from] wealthy families. They are very diversified and proliferated. They spend much of their leisure time on art experiences, sports, eating, advanced technology and fun.

If we look into the shopping cart to [look at] the overall consumption, they usually consume 30 to 50 categories annually. It’s a very wide brand range. [They shop] with high frequency, especially for luxury consumption – twice per year and pay for the total price.

They both look for classic [products] and newly launched ones. So about the touchpoint, it’s also a little bit different from our previous understanding.

Alison Tudor-Ackroyd: Got it. Thank you, Kathy. With 11.11 fast-approaching, the largest shopping event in the global retail calendar, how important would you say 11.11 is for luxury retailers?

Kathy Jiang: Previously there was some bias from luxury clients because 11.11 sounded like a discount-driven [event for] the mass market.

However, we think 11.11 has already become the key moment for Chinese consumers to think about what to add to their shopping cart [for] the next half of the year.

It’s very important for even luxury clients to engage with consumers further, to emphasize the brand image, and to be closer to the consumers when they approach the next key milestone during their entire life cycle.

Alison Tudor-Ackroyd: May I ask a little bit more about 11.11? Are you expecting to see any technical breakthroughs or innovations? Are you expecting more livestreaming from brands or the use of metaverse technology?

Kathy Jiang: Metaverse technology is a very hot topic, [and] it has been discussed a lot among our luxury clients.

The digital form and immersive experiences are very important; we have seen something like the 3D interactive works displayed on the artworks or the SKUs (stock keeping units) provided by the clients, the online fashion show, and virtual reality-themed creation. All have provided a better experience. Personalization is another theme that could be empowered by digital [technology].

For example, the online and offline integration to create a new event makes it more agile.

Also, customize the services to show individuality, like customizing the signature. Localized communications are also very important, especially on social content; no doubt livestreaming is among them.

However, one reminder to luxury clients is that they need to keep a well-balanced mix of formats, so not to disrupt consumers to much and destroy their classical understanding of luxury and its taste, aspiration, and loyalty.

Last but not least, we have seen many online consumers who are usually more open-minded and care about a sustainable lifestyle. So how to engage and convert willingness to do actual business is another topic open to all luxury clients.

Alison Tudor-Ackroyd: In our last few minutes Kathy, may I ask you what are your top three suggestions for luxury houses looking to build an omnichannel presence in China? What should they be looking to achieve?

Kathy Jiang: Brand clients should proactively understand consumers and build effective communication bridges between brand values and consumers. They need to anchor in the minds of the new generation of consumers and pay more attention to the intimate relationship between the consumer and the brand [so that they can] keep a loyal relationship in the long term.

The second point is that the brand clients need to use consumer communication skills to cater to consumer needs. And the brand takes the lead. In the future, both the brand and the customers can co-create.

Last but not least, I think the point would be to interact effortlessly with new digital technologies including VR, AR and the metaverse; that would deliver a more relaxed, pleasant, and immersive experience to customers in the future where consumers can purchase whenever and wherever possible.

Alison Tudor-Ackroyd: Thank you, Kathy. Super informative chat. Really enjoyed it.

https://poetsandquants.com/2023/03/07/top-consulting-firms-to-work-for-in-europe-and-asia/,Top Consulting Firms To Work For In Europe & Asia,"Different locations. Same results.

Wherever you go, Bain & Company sets the bar.

That was the takeaway from a second Vault Consulting survey by Firsthand. Last month, Bain & Company earned the highest survey marks in the North American ranking. When the same survey was given to consultants across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) and the Asia-Pacific (APAC), Bain again emerged as the best place to work.

The only difference? In North America, Bain has now held the #1 ranking in the Vault Consulting 50 for three consecutive years. In both the EMEA and APAC regions, Bain knocked McKinsey out of the top spot this year.

BEST CONSULTING FIRMS: SAME METHODOLOGY, DIFFERENT REGIONS, SIMILAR RESULTS

“We couldn’t be more thrilled to earn this recognition from Vault,” says Kara Gruver, Bain & Company’s chief talent officer, in a statement. “Our people make our firm what it is, and we will always ensure that Bain remains a company that is supportive, inclusive, and committed to their growth. We’re proud of the culture we’ve built at Bain and these rankings from Vault reaffirms our values, goals and commitment to all of our stakeholders.”

This year’s EMEA and APAC survey received responses from over 6,000 practicing consultants (compared to 16,000 across North America). The survey targeted four key areas. In the first, Vault measured employee satisfaction across 19 dimensions, including Compensation, Firm Culture, Work-Life Balance, and Firm Leadership. Here, consultants evaluated their firm on a 1-10 scale, where 10 was the highest possible score. Using the same scale, respondents also measured their firm’s commitment to Diversity involving race, gender, and sexual identity. From there, Vault queried respondents on the Prestige of competing firms, again applying the same 1-10 scale. Finally, consultants could score their rivals in their practice areas, which range from Analytics to Technology.

Like its North American counterpart, Prestige accounts for 30% of the ranking weight. Combined equally, Firm Culture and Satisfaction make up another 30% of the ranking. Three dimensions enjoy a 10% weight: Compensation, Work-Life Balance, and Level of Challenge. The remaining 10% is split evenly between Business Outlook and Promotion Policy.

SECRETS BEHIND BAIN’S SUCCESS ACROSS EUROPE

Across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), Bain outpaced McKinsey by just one-tenth of a point (9.052 vs. 8.944). Not surprisingly, Bain produced the highest survey average for Firm Culture, a company staple. What’s more, it finished 1st in six more dimensions: Firm Leadership, Formal Training, Interaction with Clients, Internal Mobility, and Promotion Policies. Not to mention, it inspired the 2nd-highest scores for Compensation, International Opportunities, Overall Satisfaction, and Selectivity. It wasn’t a dominant performance by Bain, unlike the Vault Consulting 50 for North America. In the EMEA region, Bain finished 8th for Work-Life Balance and 10th for Hours In the Office. By the same token, it ranked 3rd in Prestige in this region, .625 of a point behind McKinsey.

So why did Bain pull ahead of McKinsey? For one, Prestige was maybe the McKinsey’s only true advantage. Sure, McKinsey ranked 1st in Selectivity and 2nd in both Formal and Informal Training – but none of these dimensions carried weight. Where there was weight, McKinsey struggled. In Firm Culture and Overall Satisfaction, the firm finished a pedestrian 5th – dimensions that take up nearly a third of the Vault EMEA ranking. Plus, McKinsey posted even worse scores in areas like Business Outlook (6th), Promotion Policies (6th), Compensation (8th), and Work-Life Balance (14th) – which together comprise another 30% share of the weight.

Among Bain respondents surveyed by Firsthand, the firm’s flexibility regularly crops up. “The company promotes people who are ready for promotion, independent of current course of business,” writes one consultant. “International, standardized movement policies make it extremely easy to gain international exposure, in addition to international project experience. In some geographies like Switzerland, travel is a bit reduced. You can also move your role internally quite easily by doing internal rotations for a few months, or even longer placements.”

Overall, Roland Berger retained its #3 spot from last year in the EMEA region, thanks to ranking among the Top 3 in eight dimensions (including being the #1 firm for Heath & Wellness, Level of Challenge, and Overall Business Outlook). OC&C Strategy Partners, which placed 25th in the North American ranking, climbed to 4th – despite not ranking among the Top 5 in any dimension. Meanwhile, Kearney moved up four spots to 5th in EMEA, a rise fueled by a 5th-place score for Prestige. Publicis Sapient and Advancy also debuted at 8th and 12th respectively.

MCKINSEY STANDS OUT IN ASIA

In the APAC – or Asia-Pacific – region, Bain notched a 9.250 average from its consultants, more than .24 of a point better than McKinsey. Like the EMEA region, Bain ranks behind McKinsey and the Boston Consulting Group in Prestige (with the latter not participating in ether the EMEA or APAC ranking). However, Bain easily made up the difference by ranking 1st in 17 of 19 dimensions! Innovation (2nd) and Hours In The Office (7th) were the only areas where the firm even remotely fell short.

Ironically, McKinsey produced the highest averages in both Innovation and Hours In The Office in APAC. More impressive: McKinsey ranked 2nd in 13 dimensions, including Firm Culture, Firm Leadership, Internal Mobility, Overall Satisfaction, and Work-Life Balance. And McKinsey finished 3rd in Benefits and Compensation too, with their lowest score coming in Level of Challenge (7th).

One theme from McKinsey consultants in the APAC region: the firm has invested heavily in health and wellness for employees. “The firm is very inclusive in so many aspects,” writes one anonymous consultant. “I can also personally say that we have been well supported throughout the pandemic years. A lot of mental health and well-being support was provided. New work arrangements have also been truly helpful for working parents.”

Kearney rounds out the top three in the Vault Consulting 50 for the APAC region. It improved by four spots, led by posting the 3rd-best scores in Internal Mobility and Level of Challenge. Roland Berger, last year’s #3, moved down one spot while OC&C Strategy Consultants remained in 5th. Grant Thornton and Publicis Sapient debuted in 7th and 9th respectively.

https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/roland-berger-automotive-disruption-radar-60-of-potential-car-buyers-consider-buying-an-electric-vehicle/,Roland Berger: Automotive Disruption Radar: 60% of potential car buyers consider buying an electric vehicle,"Global EV sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales rise to 9.5%

Electric mobility is booming in spite of the difficult economic situation and tight global supply chains. As a share of global new car sales, electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids rose from 4.6% (2020) to 9.5% (2021). The trend shows no sign of slowing, with 60% of potential car buyers around the world already considering an electric vehicle as their next car. These are among the key findings of Roland Berger’s latest Automotive Disruption Radar (ADR), a twice-yearly study of 26 automotive indicators in 23 countries.

“Innovations like autonomous driving and electric mobility must be pushed if we are going to reduce global carbon emissions,” says Wolfgang Bernhart, Partner at Roland Berger. “Even though many countries have made progress, we are only just beginning to reach an inflection point for modern mobility. The task now is to take existing technologies to the next level. The automotive industry should take this challenge as an opportunity to build competitiveness for the future. The customer demand is there. Automakers that act fast can power ahead of their competition.”

China back on top

After a two-year gap, China tops the ADR ranking once again. Reasons include the fact that, as a leading country in the electric vehicle industry, it is more open to new driving technologies. Added to that, almost 500 million Chinese now have access to a 5G mobile network, a must-have for autonomous vehicles. The inflection point has arrived in China, with the 5G standard overtaking 4G.

The Netherlands placed second in the ranking, partly because of the government’s very early decision to ban the sale of combustion engine vehicles from 2030. Third is Singapore, followed by Norway and Sweden in joint fourth place. South Korea came in sixth, with Germany and the UK sharing seventh spot. Germany passed a law in May 2022 permitting vehicles with Level 4 autonomous driving capability (no human interaction needed) to be driven on public roads. This currently counts as the most progressive national legislation on autonomous driving.

Strong interest in electric vehicles leads to rising sales figures

Global supply is higher than ever, with 550 different electric vehicle (EV) and plug-in hybrid (PHEV) models, and customer demand is growing. China takes pole position in absolute numbers, with almost 3.4 million EVs and PHEVs sold. Germany is in second place, with 691,000 electric vehicles sold. In terms of the market penetration of EV/PHEV/FCEVs, Norway (76.4%), Sweden (41.2%) and the Netherlands (25.2%) lead the field.

Traditional OEMs risk falling behind

The survey reveals that new, specialized manufacturers that produce electric vehicles only and are thus able to position themselves as zero emission companies have a significant advantage against traditional OEMs. Only 12% of respondents said they would stick with the traditional OEMs when buying an electric car. Conversely, more than three times as many (38%) said they would only buy an electric vehicle from one of the new electric-only automakers.

“If the incumbent OEMs do not adapt fast to the new conditions on the market and redesign their business model from both a financial and a technological standpoint, they will find themselves overtaken by the competition,” states Stefan Riederle, Partner at Roland Berger.

From its headquarters in the Middle East, Crypto Oasis is aiming to build “one of the leading blockchain ecosystems in the world,” according to Ralf Glabischnig, who founded Crypto Oasis last year together with Saqr Ereiqat.

The group is active as an investor (Crypto Oasis Sentio invests in early-stage tokens and Crypto Oasis Metaverse invests in early-stage metaverse and web 3.0 concepts), as a hub that brings together stakeholders from across the landscape (Crypto Oasis Society), and is the initiator of DMCC Crypto Centre in Dubai.

Now teaming up with Roland Berger, Crypto Oasis expects to enhance its positioning as a value-adding ecosystem. Glabischnig: “Our ecosystem members will have access to Roland Berger’s world-class management consultancy that will support them as they embrace the opportunities to transform their business and utilise blockchain solutions.”

Roland Berger will also act as a knowledge partner. “We will be working together to release thought leadership reports to further educate and inform the market of this ever growing and evolving ecosystem.”

On top of this, “Roland Berger has a strong presence among governments and corporations, we expect this partnership to help us develop meaningful connections with them,” said Glabischnig.

By the end of this year, Crypto Oasis aims to have 1,500 organisations in its wider ecosystem (up from around 700 today), on the back of “exponential growth” in the region’s crypto and web 3.0 scene. “The significance of blockchain lies in its inherent transparency, trust and immutability.”

“Regulators in the region are welcoming innovation and disruption, making it simpler for blockchain-related companies to secure licence and operate. Our ecosystem offers unique value to new and established players – we look forward to welcoming more organisations and aspiring entrepreneurs to our growing blockchain ecosystem,” said Glabischnig.

Asked why Crypto Oasis picked Roland Berger for the collaboration, Crypto Oasis pointed at the firm’s leading position in the crypto landscape. “Roland Berger is one of the first top-tier strategy consulting firms to have entered the world of blockchain, and together we can explore the myriad of opportunities in the exciting frontier of blockchain and decentralised technologies.”

Indeed, while Roland Berger remains secretive of its client roster, the firm is known to serve as the strategic advisors behind some of the biggest recent projects in the region, including the strategy for a large bitcoin mining facility and the setup of tokenized green asset exchange.

“Roland Berger has strong capabilities in helping our ecosystem partners with developing crypto economy strategies and identify use cases and investment opportunities that are critical for the future strategic positioning,” said Glabischnig.

We all know that our planet is burning and that climate change is the most urgent, global issue we face today, one that will impact generations to come.

Germany, where Roland Berger is from, experienced its worst floods in 2021, with many experts pinpointing climate change in the North Atlantic as the source of these catastrophic events. Almost at the same time, China experienced torrential rains, causing the loss of life and economic havoc. It’s time for action.

At the current pace of emissions, our ""credit limit” of confining global warming to 1.5 degrees will take between four and eight years. For 2 degrees, it could take 20 to 25 years – if it’s possible at all. Either way, the clock is ticking.

A total of 137 countries have made a pledge to achieving carbon neutrality, 90% of which have set 2045 and 2050 as targets. That may appear distant, but the lead time for transforming industry and society involves long investment cycles, particularly in the energy and mobile infrastructure sectors, which are counted in decades.

Carbon neutrality commitments put pressure on developing solutions that are up to the challenge, but it’s also a matter of competitiveness. Consumers want to buy products with low- or zero-carbon content. So, while thinking of ways to penalize and tax high carbon content in their system, legislators across the planet are also looking at ways of taxing imports that have a high-carbon cost.

I’m a proud European because after pioneering the fight against climate change more than 20 years ago, the European Union is still at the forefront of change with the recently announced Fit-for-55 legislation package.

After the Kyoto Protocol was established in 1992, European commitments towards mostly renewable energy stemmed from Germany, with the economic and technological motivations for energy reduction already clear. The idea was to create a new market and a technological advantage for Europe within the European single market. It worked: The emissions reduction roadmap saw renewable energy production rise by 2.5 times in 10 years. However, the competitive advantage of Europe is less than certain.

China benefited greatly when it joined the WTO, becoming the producer of the majority of renewable energy equipment. It now makes 70% of the world’s solar PV modules and occupies a 60% share in the wind turbine market. And a lesson has been learned for the future: Climate change can stimulate progress in technology, while providing a competitive advantage to the leaders in the field.

Europe also learned that it needs to protect itself from carbon leakage, or the ability to outsource emissions globally. This resulted in the EU Green Deal and the Fit for 55 program under the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which sets targets as early as 2025 for some heavy industries. While bringing about a competitive advantage through technology, Europe also plans to use this time to create an estimated 2 million new jobs. Shifting to lighter carbon operations and business models will be a key driver for regional and global competition between countries, regions, and companies.

China in focus

China has a huge challenge because of the mountain of coal it starts with and because its energy consumption will continue to grow, even though the energy intensity of its economic growth has decreased by one third in the last 10 years.

However, China has a set of unique advantages, including:

A long term perspective combined with planning and execution discipline.

Supply chains that are gradually becoming integrated beyond China at a regional level in South East Asia, a movement that the RCEP treaty will accelerate.

The physical space and renewable energy resources to stimulate development.

Many potential carbon sinks such as reforestation or the restoration of wetlands.

Strong digitalization both on the consumer and supply sides.

How will China achieve carbon neutrality?

Greenhouse gas emissions are generated by every human socioeconomic activity, mostly through the combustion of fossil fuels, chemical process, and the leakage of some gases.

Power generation, mostly by coal-fired power stations, contributes half of China's CO 2 emissions.

emissions. Industrial production is responsible for one third.

Transportation by road, rail, water and air, and domestic and international travel accounts for 10%.

Up to 6% is caused by construction, construction materials, and energy efficiency in buildings.

Waste disposal and treatment, including agriculture, generates the remainder.

Energy, mobility, and buildings are central to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reaching carbon neutrality.

So, how can digitalization contribute?

The major factor towards carbon neutrality is reducing emissions upfront. First of all, what isn’t measured cannot be managed, let alone reduced. In most cases, emissions are not actually monitored, but are calculated based on data-fed algorithms that model CO 2 emissions from all types of activities. For urban activities like traffic or utilities, the data is generated from local governments’ existing information systems. For industrial activities, it comes from the instrumentation and control systems of production machinery. In both cases, this data can be real-time or generated from frequent monitoring.

One district of Mannheim in Germany deployed a smart power grid system based on the data collected from smart meters, which achieved a direct reduction in carbon. A cohort of 200 residents in one phase of the project saw a reduction of daily energy consumption by 6% to 8%, with an equivalent reduction in CO 2 emissions.

Abundant data can also be used to virtualize city planning and operations by, for example, enabling simulations that can improve city design, planning, and optimization, and by building in a low-carbon approach from the start. Urban environments are the single biggest contributor to climate change, producing two thirds of emissions.

The software company Dassault Systèmes provides multiple virtualization solutions that enable low-carbon urban planning and, in turn, new urban designs supported by environmentally optimized decisions. For example, reducing commuting time through industrial, commercial, and residential zones can optimize mobility and cut carbon footprints.

Stockholm, which plans to become carbon neutral by 2040, has implemented best practice in the field of intelligent transportation planning. The local government has reconstructed traffic routes to encourage low-carbon commuting by simulating layout, road networks, and carbon emissions. As a result, 93% of the city's residents use public transport or low-carbon ways to travel.

Energy efficiency in buildings can be increased by the continuous monitoring of key performance indicators around occupancy, heat, cold, and lighting. Doing so can achieve outcomes like minimizing heat or cold leaks and maximizing the usage of facilities. Optimized industrial processes can result in low-carbon building materials such as cement, concrete, glass, and steel.

Energy efficiency in production processes can be increased by more efficient industrial processes, for example, stopping the combustion of fossil fuel through the electrification of furnaces and tighter control of process temperature and pressure.

This is where digitalization plays a key role in saving energy by enabling instrumentation and control, real-time monitoring, and process regulation with algorithms.

Data and digitalization are key enablers of climate action and climate performance. Several key technologies can help with the modeling, visualization, monitoring, planning, and optimization processes:

IoT and the industrial Internet can generate and collect the basic data needed through things like smart and automated meters, intelligent sensors, and smart wearables.

5G and cloud can meet requirements for massive, frequent, and low latency communication.

Machine learning can process the mass of new data, enabling the understanding of greenhouse gas emissions and ways to improve it.

Corporations, as well as governments, are tackling the climate challenge out of responsibility and compliance and also to increase competitiveness. And digital technologies are the key to achieving both.",[],

A multi-billion-dollar project announced some fifteen years ago, King Abdullah Financial District is on the verge of opening up for business, with construction now at the very final stages.

The district is gearing up to become one of the region’s leading centres for prime business (the area will comprise 90+ towers with 1.6 million square metres of office space) and lifestyle (housing for 12,000 residents, 110,000 square metres of space for entertainment, culture and nature including a tree-lined walkway).

The mammoth development in the heart of Riyadh plays a central role in Saudi Arabia’s drive to bring up to 500 international companies to the capital city, with many expected to be based in King Abdullah Financial District.

Joining the likes of large banks, the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul), the Capital Market Authority, and the Saudi Research & Media Group as one of the early tenants in the King Abdullah Financial District is Roland Berger, a strategy and management consulting firm that already is involved in several initiatives of Saudi’s Vision 2030 agenda.

“We are delighted and honoured to welcome Roland Berger to the King Abdullah Financial District,” said Gautam Sashittal, the CEO of the district. “As a key strategy consultant in the region, Roland Berger contributes to Saudi Arabia’s infrastructure and the fulfilment of Vision 2030.”

“Saudi Arabia is a key market for Roland Berger,” said Rene Seyger, Managing Partner at Roland Berger in the Middle East. ""We have successfully developed and delivered multiple projects at a national level in support of the Kingdom’s ambitious Vision 2030.”

While Roland Berger is traditionally secretive about its client base, known is that the European-origin rival to the ‘MBB’ (McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group and Bain & Company) has supported projects including: advising on the establishment of Saudi Arabia’s national waste management company, supporting the rollout of the Kingdom’s affordable housing schemes, and laying the foundations for the country’s first electric vehicles manufacturing facility.

But the firm’s local work extends further, pointed out Seyger: “Our track record spans a broad spectrum of topics, from sustainability and social infrastructure to mobility, renewable energy and next-generation manufacturing.”

From its fresh base, Roland Berger aims to expand its presence in the region’s largest economy. “Our establishment in the district demonstrates our focus on Saudi Arabia and our deep commitment to growing our presence in the Kingdom,” said Michael Caracache, a Partner at Roland Berger and General Manager of the Saudi market.

|

As luxury shopping becomes accessible to younger generations and residents of China’s lower-tier cities, new lifestyle and consumption preferences are emerging among domestic consumers, according to Alibaba Group’s high-end retail platform Tmall Luxury Pavilion.

The recently published Tmall Luxury Strategic Consumer Profiles White Paper points to growing digital awareness among Chinese luxury shoppers as well as a move towards investment buying.

“Chinese consumers are diverse, with very different lifestyles, values, different understanding of luxury products,” George Ren, a senior partner at consultancy Roland Berger, said in a statement.

Roland Berger collaborated with Alibaba on the white paper to implement their RB Profiler data analytics program, developed specifically for brand marketing in most B2C industries.

RB Profiler found six distinct types of Luxury Platform consumers, from stay-at-home mothers with disposable incomes to young trend setters who use the digital platform to explore luxury products.

Tmall Luxury Pavilion provides the means for brands to better connect with these shoppers.

“We saw a percentage growth in younger generations shopping luxury on our platform in the past year, all thanks to the digitalized means used by brands to approach consumers,” said Alibaba’s luxury division chief Janet Wang, who heads Tmall Luxury Pavilion.

VR and AI-powered digital tools have allowed luxury buying to become more intimate. Tmall Luxury Pavilion allows consumers to virtually try on clothing, view 3D jewelry renderings, and receive one-on-one consultations from their living rooms.

Shoppers are flocking to the platform. During last month’s 6.18 Mid-Year Shopping Festival, it reported double-digit growth in average transaction value, suggesting consumers are browsing on the platform longer and buying more.

Catch Them All

Consumers coming of age in a digital world are driving demand for collectible digital luxury products.

The cohort of consumers born between 1980 and 1995, also known as Millennials, make up over 67% of shoppers on Tmall Luxury Pavilion, while the more digitally-native Generation Z born between 1996 and 2010 takes up over 17%.

Brands on the platform released more than 2,000 limited-edition digital collectibles during last month’s 6.18 Mid-Year Shopping Festival. These include 100 digital watch tokens from Swiss luxury watchmaker Breitling SA.

“It was an immediate hit among consumers. We saw consumers jumping on opportunities to own the digital collectibles just like the way they snatch the limited-edition products in real life,” said Wang.

These high-class digital collectibles are just as exclusive as tangible luxury products, if not more, which “created a special connection between the brands and digitally savvy consumers,” she noted.

Stocks and Sapphires

However, luxury buying isn’t all fun and games, as investing in quality products gains traction among consumers looking to store value in uncertain economic times.

“We’ve spotted a significant increase of consumer demand in products with investment values,” said Wang.

An uptick in related keyword searches on Tmall Luxury Pavilion, such as “watches with long-term value,” alerted Wang and her team to the phenomenon.

“It’s a new trend we’ve noticed this year. There was a double-digit growth in the amount of higher value luxury products sold at this 6.18, all priced above RMB100,000 ($14,900) each,” said Wang.

Jewelry, watches and other durable luxury goods remain the focus of value-seeking consumers, and product searches in these categories lead shoppers to a page for browsing high-end collectibles.

“We’ve spotted the growing consumer demand and hope this will help fulfill it,” said Wang.",['Chloe Shen'],2022-07-12 01:01:00+00:00
https://phys.org/news/2022-11-reveals-extent-gender-inequality-start-up.html,Study reveals extent of gender inequality in start-up landscape,"Gender distribution of founders by technology. Credit: Theresa Treffers et al, Gender diversity in German and French startups - still a long way to go to close the gap (2022) https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1690861/1690861.pdf

Women are significantly underrepresented in German and French start-ups, especially in technical industries. This applies to both founders and employees, as a study from TUM in collaboration with the Roland Berger Foundation for European Management now shows. In companies founded by all-female teams, the proportion of women in the workforce is almost twice as high as in male-established ventures. Start-ups launched by men also have a much higher valuation.

Similar to mature companies, start-ups are increasingly shining the spotlight on the importance of gender equality. However, unlike in larger enterprises, the level of diversity in start-ups has not been explored in much detail to date.

With this in mind, a research team from TUM, supported by the Roland Berger Foundation for European Management, set about analyzing roughly 700 German and 1,000 French start-ups. To ensure comparability, the researchers focused on companies that had received seed funding between 2012 and 2016. They analyzed information from the database Dealroom and matched it with data shared by around 80,000 start-up employees on LinkedIn.

The analysis shows that only around 3 percent of the German and 4 percent of the French start-ups surveyed were founded by all-female teams or solo female founders. Around 83 percent of German and 84 percent of French companies were founded by men, while 14 and 12 percent, respectively, were launched by mixed teams.

Exceeding 60 percent, the proportion of male employees is also significantly higher in both countries. It is striking that all-female founding teams have 62 percent female employees, while in start-ups founded by male teams that figure is just 35 percent.

Women particularly underrepresented in tech industry

The research team also investigated how the gender divide breaks down across industries. In Germany, the proportion of female founders is comparatively high in the dating industry (50%) and in fashion (29%). However, there are hardly any female founders in robotics or real estate (3% each), for instance. The picture is similar in France. Here, female founders are most strongly represented in the wellness and beauty industry (25%), but are rare in markets such as fintech (5%).

Looking at employee figures, the analysis also shows that women are strongly underrepresented in technology industries. Of the sectors surveyed, the computer games industry in Germany (19%) and the semiconductor industry in France (17%) were among those with the lowest proportions of women.

No female founders in quantum technology

Similar to the analysis about start-up industries as defined by the product, the study also analyzed the gender distribution according to the technologies that start-ups use. In Germany, women most frequently founded start-ups using virtual reality (20%). Ventures using technologies for the Internet of Things were very rarely launched by women (3%). Meanwhile, in the quantum technology sector no female founders at all could be found—as it was also the case in France. In that country, the share of female founders was highest in start-ups using nanotech (14%).

Male-established start-ups have much higher valuation

Across both countries, valuations by investors are also marked by inequality. While male-led German start-ups are valued at a median of 21 million US dollars, start-ups with all-female founder teams are at around 6 million dollars. In France, male-established start-ups are valued at a median of 14 million dollars, compared with 4 million dollars for female-led ventures.

Increasing gender parity in start-up processes

""Women are significantly underrepresented in the start-up space, both as founders and as employees—across all industries, technologies and revenue models,"" says study leader Dr. Theresa Treffers of TUM's Chair of Strategy and Organization.

""If we look at studies in social psychology, we can see what drives this lack of gender diversity. Investors have the perception that men are better suited to entrepreneurial roles. And we are missing female students in STEM subjects—in other words, subjects that would likely be the springboard for future founders and start-up employees. Women only make up around 30 percent of STEM students.""

The study recommends several measures for a more diverse and inclusive start-up landscape. ""The most important thing is to combat gender bias and stereotypes, for instance by promoting female role models at an early stage,"" explains Felicitas Schneider, member of the Management Board of the Roland Berger Foundation for European Management.

""Targeted support needs to be available for female founders, since women hire more women."" The study also sees room for improvement in founding and investment processes, for example through gender-neutral start-up programs and a higher proportion of women in management positions at venture capital firms.",['Technical University Munich'],
https://www.automotiveworld.com/articles/fleet-decarbonisation-demands-investment-in-new-capabilities/,Fleet decarbonisation demands investment in new capabilities,"Roland Berger explores how fleets can tackle the transformation to a cleaner transportation ecosystem

The environment for freight electrification, be it via battery electric vehicles of fuel cells, has never been so positive. Even in the US, a market often associated with a rather measured approach towards a de-carbonised future, things have decidedly turned a corner.

On the regulation side, the environment is positive not only at the state level (led by California) but also at the federal level with the recent Inflation Reduction Act providing significant incentives for fleet electrification and infrastructure construction. Customer demand is strong. Many fleets have identified their emission reduction targets, and the leaders have committed to carbon neutral or even net zero operations by 2035-2050. Their desire to decarbonise transport reflects the expectations of their key stakeholders—investors, end customers and employees. Based on Roland Berger’s observations, many fleets are even pulling forward their de-carbonisation targets by four to six quarters.

Technology development is also moving in the right direction. Battery technology is maturing and lower cost alternatives such as LFPM technology promise cost-efficient operation for use cases not only in passenger cars and buses but also in some commercial vehicle applications. On the fuel cell side, the drive to either develop commercial vehicle focused powertrains or to adapt passenger vehicle technology to commercial vehicle duty cycles is on. Remaining challenges should be largely addressed by the end of this decade.

What then is holding us back to move boldly into the new, de-carbonised future? Two main challenges remain that require multi-stakeholder co-operation and investment. On the one hand, the build up of adequate infrastructure is key. For return to base operations or dedicated routes between two warehouses, the investment requirements are likely to be borne by carriers or infrastructure partners. Here, having charging or hydrogen refuelling on-site gives the operator full control over site access, charger type, and timing. Also, the cost of fuel is lower than at public stations that need to recoup investments and make a profit. Yet, new capabilities around, for example, vehicle-to-grid charging or green energy implementation have to be built up.

On-route charging/re-fuelling or opportunity charging/re-fuelling requires a public network that enables battery electric and fuel cell trucks to fill up during transit as a means to extend range. Early initiatives are on the way, e.g., the effort along the I-5 in California. Most of these initiatives are currently state and utility driven with the first commercial vehicle OEMs getting into the fray. Key challenges that need to be addressed include interoperability testing, authentication and billing. Also, commercial vehicles need high-power L3 chargers, which are hard to come by. As shown in the graph below, a paltry fraction of all public chargers in the US are relevant L3 chargers with more than 300 kW.

The other concerns centre around the availability of key inputs. Take battery electric vehicles as an example. Current projections for BEV penetration indicate a CAGR of about 30% between 2020 and 2030, i.e., a six-fold increase in demand from today until the end of the decade.

Clearly, such exponential growth is likely to lead to bottlenecks from the perspective of access to key battery raw materials (Li, Ni, Co, Mn, graphite) as well as copper as adequate mining and refining capacities will take time to build up. Similarly, battery cell production may not keep up with demand in the mid-term. Similar questions exist around the availability and price points of blue or green hydrogen. While Roland Berger believes that these concerns will be addressed, it is important to understand the challenges, take pre-emptive measures and watch the development closely.

Lastly, the electrification journey for fleets isn’t a simple undertaking either. Based on our work with several fleets, it is clear that we are talking about a major transformation that includes internal as well as external stakeholders. Fleets understand the basic application profiles of electric and hydrogen vehicles, hydrogen being advantageous for long range and high-variability operations. Yet translating general understanding into the details of the fleets routes and operations takes careful deliberation. As the transition is costly and capital intensive, being able to tap into the right funding pools is a must.

Understanding the impact that your operations have on the environment requires detailed baselining, i.e., the analysis of the current energy consumption/emissions as well as future consumption and emissions based on business development projections. With this baseline, companies can move towards setting decarbonisation targets. It is important to set these targets while understanding which measures can be deployed to avoid, reduce or off-set emissions. Committing to targets without knowing how to get there is dangerous as the likelihood of over-promising and under-delivering is high.

Part of the decarbonisation journey will have to include moving a significant fraction of each fleet to battery electric or hydrogen vehicles. Finding the right routes, applications and vehicles is crucial. Ideally, vehicles should be custom-made for specific applications and routes (e.g., last mile delivery). Yet we have to be conscious that complexity needs to be kept to a manageable level. After all, fleets need to train their workforce to maintain and repair electric vehicles, parts inventories need to be at acceptable levels and vehicles need to be integrated into new fleet management solutions. Beyond training their own employees, fleets need to be mindful of external stakeholders as well. In one case, one of our customers spent a significant amount of time and effort in training first responders on how to handle their electric vehicles.

Lastly, securing best cost access to charging infrastructure and green electrons and/or molecules is key to successfully making the transition. This will require engagement with a large ecosystem of players including OEMs, charging solutions providers, utilities, infrastructure companies, etc. There are a number of players competing in the area of fleet sustainability management services—OEMs (incumbent and start-up), charging infrastructure providers, utility providers, software providers, civil works/services players, spare parts players, renewable energy players, etc. The landscape is complex and evolving, and a clear leader among business models and companies has not been found yet.

Part of the decarbonisation journey will have to include moving a significant fraction of each fleet to battery electric or hydrogen vehicles

Overall, fleets need to invest in a new set of complex capabilities and activities if they want to manage and operate decarbonised fleets. Advanced analytics, build up of procurement scale and purchasing power, employee training, frequent regulations, policy and subsidy tracking are some of the areas that need close attention as fleets move through their decarbonisation journey. Not all of these capabilities may have to be fully in-house and we are seeing different sourcing and partnership approaches across various logistics players.

One thing is certain, decarbonised fleet operators and the energy and transportation ecosystem that they operate in will be very different in a few years time. It is time to tackle and manage this transformation and to get ahead of the curve.

https://www.consultancy-me.com/news/5281/middle-easts-bold-green-hydrogen-ambition-needs-quick-action,Middle East's bold green hydrogen ambition needs 'quick action',"When it comes to green hydrogen, the Middle East is in pole position to emerge as a dominant player on the global stage, according to the views of 400 energy leaders in the region. But the region’s own optimism needs to be backed by real action, highlights a new report.

The report by Siemens Energy and strategic consultancy Roland Berger explores how the region is working towards its ambition of becoming a major supplier of sustainable energy to global markets.

Not surprisingly, much of the region’s focus goes to green hydrogen – the production of hydrogen from renewable energy (or from low-carbon power). Green hydrogen is considered by many as one of the key pillars of the energy transition, with the International Renewable Energy Agency predicting that hydrogen and its derivatives will be able to account for 12% of global energy consumption by 2050.

Among the 400 energy experts surveyed by Siemens Energy and Roland Berger, the sentiment was not much different. “Green hydrogen is key for the energy transition,” summarizes Karim Amin, Executive Board Member at Siemens Energy.

The Middle East has the right cards to become a major exporter, in particular due to the availability of abundant and low-cost renewables, existing export infrastructure and the availability of massive financing resources.

Europe is earmarked as the top and logistically most feasible export opportunity. Demand for hydrogen in Europe is forecast to grow from its current level of 10 million tons a year to 20 million tons by 2030, and 95 million tons by 2050. Around half of this demand will be met by imports.

“Exporting green hydrogen to Europe presents a major economic prospect and the opportunity to gain geo-political significance in the global decarbonisation effort,” states Pierre Samaties, a Partner at Roland Berger.

The UAE and Saudi Arabia have been quick to spot the opportunity, and have crafted bold plans. The United Arab Emirates aims to capture 25% of the global market for hydrogen, while Saudi Arabia even aims to become the world’s largest supplier. Other countries in the region making notable progress are Oman and Egypt.

As it stands, a total of 46 green hydrogen projects are already underway in the Middle East and Africa. For the period to 2030, more than 40 investments of over $20 billion have so far been announced, as well as many more smaller projects.

“The development of green hydrogen is currently driven chiefly by hydrogen developers such as NEOM, ACWA Power, Masdar and OQ. These players are supported by the public sector, which is responsible for enabling factors such as hydrogen valleys, access to technology, clear regulation and the availability of human capital,” explains Samaties.

Gearing up

However, to meet demand and the region’s ambitions, the report emphasizes the need to ramp up production capacity. In doing so, the authors identify three key areas where action is needed: policy, funding and technological innovation.

“The success of the energy transition hinges on the existence of a clear, stable policy framework. Business and financial institutions need this solid basis on which to make their long-term and often irreversible investment decisions. Building the required infrastructure for decarbonising society also requires funding that is front-loaded at the development stage of projects,” states the report.

Technology meanwhile is required to drive more efficiency in hydrogen production (for example: to ensure that hydrogen an also decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors), better streamline and organise (international) energy flows across networks, and prepare the future energy grid for a greater share of intermittent renewable energies.

Nabil Alnuaim, Chief Digital Officer at Saudi Aramco, says: “Transitioning to hydrogen requires huge investment to develop technology, build projects and establish marketplaces that collectively contribute to a cleaner energy future. This coordinated effort by all stakeholders must be supported by policymakers to achieve success.”

With the cost of inaction rising by the day, Siemens Energy and Roland Berger call for concerted action. Christian Bruch, President and CEO, Siemens Energy, says, “Everyone gets [the burning platform for change] and has the same ambition, but we have an implementation problem, not an identification problem.”

Echoing the report’s recommendation, H.E. Suhail Al Mazrouei, the UAE’s Minister of Energy & Infrastructure, concludes: “We need to act, and we need to act quickly.”",[],2022-08-01 10:20:00+00:00
https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/greenwashing-roland-berger-brands-3d-printings-sustainability-superficial-materialise-calls-for-more-focus-and-investment-208342/,"Greenwashing? Roland Berger brands 3D printing’s sustainability “superficial,” Materialise calls for more “focus and investment”","International management consultancy firm Roland Berger has called for sweeping changes across 3D printing to turn the sector’s “superficial” and potentially “misleading” sustainability benefits into reality.

In a paper titled ‘Sustainable Additive Manufacturing,’ Roland Berger claims that the technology is more than capable of delivering on its much-touted eco-friendliness, but it must first become “more transparent.” The company’s assertions are based on research, which has shown that prior to entering production, 3D printed parts have a larger carbon footprint than traditionally-manufactured counterparts.

To address these results, Roland Berger has highlighted the need for more life cycle assessments (LCAs), so that the industry is able to create a ‘baseline’ from which it can deliver, and issued a roadmap designed to help realize 3D printing’s potential.

When contacted for a response to these findings, Erik de Zeeuw, Materialise’s Market Manager for Certified Manufacturing, revealed that the firm was actually consulted on the project. What’s more, while de Zeeuw highlighted the inconclusive nature of the research, he didn’t opt to challenge its outcomes, and instead called for more “focus and investment” into making material production sustainable.

“Additive manufacturing companies need to be mindful about the use of valuable resources and develop innovative technologies to reduce our impact – from reducing scrap rates and increasing the usage of recycled powder,” explained de Zeeuw. “This includes more focus on better understanding the printing process and increasing our ability to control and optimize it.”

Roland Berger’s 3D printing report

At first glance, Roland Berger says that 3D printing offers greater material efficiency than subtractive processes, making it the “perfect technology for responsible manufacturing.” Yet, upon closer inspection, the consultancy firm claims that additive manufacturing “falls short of this lofty ambition,” as it often requires the use of thermally or chemically-treated materials, raising the amount of energy it uses.

Roland Berger also points out that during metal 3D printing, materials often need to be sieved to enable them to retain an optimal particle size distribution, resulting in “large amounts of scrap powder,” while some methods still bring long lead times.

Due to these factors, as well as the lengthy post-processing needed by certain end-use parts, the firm’s Tim Femmer claims that at face value, 3D printing’s pre-production phase energy consumption may even give it a “larger environmental footprint.” That being said, the Project Manager adds that the amount of material saved via it being an additive process, “more than makes up for” these shortfalls.

Additionally, by enabling part consolidation at the design stage, Femmer says that additive manufacturing can deliver weight and performance advantages that are impossible to achieve via traditional methods. Using an aerospace bracket as an example, the engineer explains in the paper, that switching from milling to LPBF 3D printing the part, allows it to be made with a reduced mass of up to 65%.

Again, in response to Femmer’s “larger environmental footprint” claims, de Zeeuw doesn’t dispute his findings, but does highlight that this isn’t always the case.

“While uncertainty remains, there are examples to demonstrate that a part produced using AM doesn’t necessarily start with a larger environmental footprint,” says de Zeeuw. “Small series production with injection molding, is likely to have a bigger impact in terms of the production set-up, And for the production of complex parts, 3D printing, in the case of DED, requires up to 75% less metal compared with incumbent forging and metal processes.”

Mapping a path to a greener AM

Based on its initial findings, Roland Berger has issued a roadmap for bringing greater clarity to the potential environmental benefits gained by switching to 3D printing. As a first step to achieving this, the firm recommends that material manufacturers estimate the amount of CO2 emitted during their production processes, and include the result in their products’ technical parameters.

If 3D printer developers were to follow suit by indicating the eco-friendliness of running their machines for set periods, Roland Berger argues that this would also allow users to estimate the energy and emission cost of each part, while along with further industry LCAs, helping them establish the technology’s sustainability.

Describing such LCAs as “important” to “better understanding 3D printing’s sustainability,” de Zeeuw adds that even Materialise, which runs “one of the largest 3D printing factories in the world,” currently lacks data on this. While admitting that compiling this information about 3D printing’s varied technologies is challenging, de Zeeuw highlights the particular need for research into the “footprint of feedstock.”

For its part, Roland Berger says the creation of a “quick and easy tool” capable of predicting the difference in the sustainability of 3D printed and traditionally produced parts is “essential” to driving the tech’s adoption, and highlights areas like powder recycling, inert gas consumption and build area optimization as also having a part to play.

Ultimately, de Zeeuw says that Materialise is taking a similar approach, and doesn’t consider the issue to be a question of whether 3D printing is sustainable, rather as a matter of “what we can do” to make it more so. Whether it be through the utilization of renewable energy, or the development of recyclable or plant-based materials, de Zeeuw believes Materialise is doing everything it can to make this possible.

3D printing’s sustainability drive

Despite Roland Berger’s relatively negative take on the environmental impact of adopting 3D printing, there are examples of initiatives across the industry that are working towards improving its sustainability. The Additive Manufacturer Green Trade Association continues to make strides in this area, and the organization unveiled plans to investigate the LCA of 3D printed aerospace parts late last year.

Materialise itself has also launched Bluesint PA12, a technology designed to enable 3D printing with up to 100% recycled powder. In practice, the process is able to achieve this by making use of two lasers, with one sintering a new layer, and the other maintaining a temperature that keeps the previous layer at the correct heat, reducing the ‘orange-peel’ effect that’s often observed when re-using powder.

Elsewhere, in construction-oriented developments, researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IIT Guwahati) have even come up with a way of 3D printing industrial waste into sustainable structures. Leveraging a novel material which uses local waste as a binder, the team has been able to 3D print a unique piece of ‘urban furniture,’ while reducing their concrete consumption by 75%.

https://www.consultancy-me.com/news/4939/roland-berger-at-the-forefront-of-crypto-strategy-consulting,Roland Berger at the forefront of crypto strategy consulting,"Hype surrounding the virtual assets and crypto landscape is seeing the market boom. Roland Berger is looking to position itself as an early front-runner in the segment’s strategy advisory space.

In the 12 years since Bitcoin first launched, the crypto economy has evolved from a hype among the tech-savvy into one of the world’s most talked about developments in the finance and payments realm.

In the MENA region, the rise of crypto is especially pronounced, with a recent report from Gemini Exchange (based on a survey of nearly 30,000 people in 20 countries) showing that crypto ownership in the UAE is the third highest worldwide, trailing only Indonesia and Brazil.

Global strategy and management consultancy Roland Berger boasts a strong presence in MENA, and with demand for crypto advisory services booming and market developments unfolding rapidly, the company is building a reputation at the forefront of the burgeoning landscape.

According to Feroz Sanaulla and Pierre Samaties, the partners in charge of leading the firm’s global Crypto Economy team, Roland Berger is “the first top-tier strategy consulting firm to have entered into the world of crypto economy.”

Speaking to ConsultancyME, the pair explained that as the emergent market becomes increasingly accepted among large corporations, businesses, and governments both globally and in the MENA region, Roland Berger is “taking a leading and courageous role towards the future of technology.”

“We support our global clients in understanding the opportunities and risks of the space and develop implementable crypto economy strategies. A key differentiator is that we really understand the ins and outs of the economics and technology and are well embedded in the global crypto ecosystem,” stated Samaties – who has been active in the crypto economy since 2015.

""We have team members that are deep into blockchain technology, including writing smart contracts, creating tokens etc. This is a must if you want to give sound strategic advice and also ensure our clients are well protected” added Sanaulla.

Increasing adoption and signature projects

While the firm is traditionally secretive about its projects (most tier-one strategy consultancies are tight-lipped about their client work), publicly known is that Roland Berger is involved with key crypto economy projects in the UAE.

One project saw the consultancy support strategy setting for a large-scale crypto mining facility being built in the country. “A sovereign fund selected us as its strategy consultant. As well as delivering the strategy, we are also providing hands-on support in the setting up the implementation phase, helping the project to get built by a consortium of players,” said Samaties.

The project aims to create a several-hundred-Megawatt Bitcoin mining site. Bitcoin mining is the process of creating new coins by solving complex ‘mathematical puzzles’. “The process is energy intensive, however energy systems and miners are in parts complimentary and that’s why you see that in well-regulated markets, miners and utilities are creating a symbiosis that offers new ways of demand management and monetisation of power,” said Samaties.

Another engagement is focused on the development of a strategic crypto cluster for a regulator in the emirate. The goal is to attract crypto economy heavyweights to the emirate, and the consultants have so far assisted in setting the strategy, building the ecosystem, identifying regulations and selecting a list of companies who could act as anchors for the cluster.

Sanaulla clarified, “A crypto cluster is much like the planetary system. An anchor company at the centre attracts other companies around it. This attracts talent and innovation. The UAE is enacting flexible regulatory frameworks that will allow pilots and experimentation while in other jurisdictions these entities would be drowned in regulation.”

Roland Berger pieced together a holistic strategy on how to attract the cluster’s initial entities, weighing up what organisations and individuals like them would be attracted to – including incentive plans and required regulation. At the same time, the firm is helping to build an environment capable of attracting “champions of the future,” not the next Google, so much as “the next unknown innovator.”

Meanwhile, in 2021, Roland Berger developed the strategy and business model for an initiative called GreenChain, a platform owned and launched by GMIS that aims to tokenise sustainable investments in renewable energy.

Commenting on the UAE’s growth in the crypto scene, Sanaulla remarked, “The UAE has become a progressive nurturing ground for the crypto economy. Instead of benchmarking against others they are being disruptive and leap frogging. We are working across various sectors on all crypto economy themes as we develop business and investment opportunities for our clients.”

Seven key trends in the crypto economy

On the back of its early experiences in the field, Roland Berger has developed seven trends that are set to shape the crypto economy over the next years:

1. The future of finance

2. Asset tokenisation

3. The rise of the metaverse

4. Supply chain improvement

5. Web3 and the data economy

6. Crypto mining & staking

7. Digital identity

For businesses still resistant to crypto’s advancement, Sanaulla and Samaties have a stark warning. Amid the storm of disruption on the horizon, some traditional sectors will cease to exist quickly, or see a slow drift into irrelevance, if they fail to embrace the crypto economy soon.

Samaties argued, “We are at the intersection of an Uber moment for many industries, and even an Uber moment for Uber might be on its way, we are excited to shape this new future.”

“Roland Berger has a strong global team committed to helping its clients in successfully developing their crypto economy strategies before it is too late. Based on our rich ecosystem network with crypto companies, start-ups and incubators, we help clients find solid and trustworthy implementation partners,” noted the duo.

https://www.moderntiredealer.com/articles/33387-how-to-prepare-your-dealership-to-service-more-evs,How to Prepare Your Dealership to Service More EVs,"This MTD exclusive was provided by Barry Neal, a senior partner and member of Roland Berger’s North American management team, and Neury Freitas, a principal at Roland Berger.

Independent tire dealers have weathered different technology developments during the automotive industry’s history. As vehicle design and components have continued to move from mechanical to electromechanical and electronic, tire dealers have remained nimble in order to serve vehicle needs.

At the same time, battery electric vehicles (BEVs), advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and vehicle connectivity represent large changes in vehicle technology, service requirements and capabilities.

Tire dealers must prepare for these changes in terms of training, investment and business processes, while aligning their investments to vehicle parc penetration and their individual business strategies.

The EV forecast

Forecasted electric vehicle (EV) demand has increased significantly post-COVID-19, with forecast estimates increasing from 21% of United States vehicle production to 29% by the year 2030. These forecast increases have been driven by the federal government, the success of new EV entrants and increased focus and launch targets from traditional original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

Hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles sales are also expected to increase significantly from 5% today to 26% by 2030. Hybrids are anticipated to take a larger share of the market in the U.S. relative to Europe and China due to the more suburban population of the U.S., longer driving patterns, less use of regional public transit and less stringent regulation.

According to Roland Berger’s most recent Automotive Disruption Radar Survey, 50% of U.S. consumers who don’t currently own EVs would consider an EV for their next purchase.

At the same time, while vehicle range, price and charging access/speed have all improved, these elements remain the most significant impediments to EV uptake. Here’s a more detailed look:

Range. Vehicle ranges on 2022 base models vary from 100 miles (Mazda MX-30) to 520 miles (Lucid Air Dream Edition.) These range values are further limited by OEM guidance to retain batteries between 20% and 80% of charge to maximize battery life, plus extreme weather conditions, which can reduce range by up to 15%.





Price. Average transaction values for EVs in the U.S. in 2021 were $56,000 versus $46,000 for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, excluding federal and state subsidies. EV sales are heavily over-indexed into higher price tag luxury sports cars and larger SUVs. And a high percentage of EVs sold today are part of households that have more than two vehicles. Battery cost is the key driver of higher pricing and limits customer acceptance in both the broader volume market segment, as well as used EV vehicle sales.





Charging access. Roland Berger’s Annual EV Charging Index scores the U.S. h in EV charging infrastructure maturity behind China, the Netherlands, Norway and France. U.S. public infrastructure density remains very low compared to other countries. The U.S. has only 100 to 200 charging stations per million people or 1.3 stations per 100 miles of roadway, compared with the Netherlands and Norway, for example, which have 1,000 to 2,000 charging stations per million people and 25 to 30 charging stations per 100 miles of roadway.

Despite limited public infrastructure, 83% of current U.S. EV owners surveyed were satisfied with their current charging experience. This reflects localized use cases - where 87% of charging is done at home - and the regionality of EV uptake in the U.S. REGIONALITY OF

The EV market

It’s not vehicle sales that impact the independent tire dealer, but the number of post-warranty vehicles out there. By 2035, BEVs will comprise just 15% of the entire vehicle parc, with only a 5% penetration in vehicles eight years and older.

EV uptake also is heavily concentrated, with 73% of EV sales centered in 10 states. California alone accounts for 43% of EV sales, due to the influence of vehicle emission requirements, less extreme weather conditions and more urban environments with shorter average commutes.

The good, the bad and the ugly





BEVs are estimated to require fewer visits and less total service and repair maintenance than ICE vehicles, excluding battery replacement, with an average of 1.8 visits per year versus 2.7 for an ICE. The Chevrolet Bolt maintenance calendar, for example, only calls for a tire rotation every 7,500 miles, a cabin air filter replacement every 22,500 miles and a coolant flush at 150,000 miles. These forecasts are based on mature technology and are driven primarily by the reduction in mechanical and wear components.





Even in the mid-term, the BEV impact is very different by aftermarket service channel. While quick lube and general service shops may see a downward risk of up to 40% of revenue per vehicle before new service categories and pricing adjustments, tire-heavy business models will see an overall balanced impact to revenue, with increased tire revenue compensating for lost sales in traditional service categories.





The good. There are several BEV categories that provide more frequent and higher-value service opportunities. The most critical of these - and positively for independent tire dealers - are tires. Instant torque and the additional weight of EV batteries create more significant tire wear than ICE vehicles and require heavier tires with more structural support.





Additionally, tread design and materials are key elements in achieving important BEV performance criteria, including range and low cabin noise. Range, as noted previously, is one of the most important BEV purchase criteria and tires with lower roll resistance are critical to achieving OE range certifications.





BEV passengers are also much more cognizant of tire road noise due to lack of engine “white noise.” The materials and tread that assist in achieving the above conditions generally also result in more expensive, higher-wear tire choices. Many BEV adopters are finding a need for new tires after as soon as 9,000 to 10,000 miles. With an average price increase of 10% per tire versus a comparable ICE car tire — with some offerings ranging up to a 40% premium — and faster wear, BEV tire sales create a significant opportunity.





Other key service opportunities on BEVs include chassis and suspension components, with a similar trade-off between higher wear and/or more robust components to balance the increased weight and forces and motor cooling. In addition, greater use of electronics and mechatronics in both propulsion and other body and chassis components creates higher part costs per repair order. Several new component categories also exist on BEVs — such as increased thermal management and battery coolant, battery checkups and repair — and drive motor/inverter repair and replacement.





The bad includes brakes and traditional battery replacement. Regenerative braking reduces pad and rotor wear. In addition, some components found in current model BEVs - such as the secondary, lower voltage battery and mild transmissions/drivebox, like that on the Porsche Taycan - are likely to be eliminated in most volume and even luxury applications in future generations.





The ugly includes many regular maintenance items, such as lubricants, engine and air filters, spark plugs, oxygen sensors, fuel management and timing and drive belts, which are eliminated on BEVs. A comparison between the Volkswagen Golf and Chevy Bolt BEV, for example, highlights that 79% of the 173 moving and wear components in the Golf are not present in the Bolt.

Service requirements





The investments required to fully service BEVs are significant. New vehicle dealers investing in the ability to service BEVs are typically investing a minimum of $250,000, not including technician training. These costs cover EV charging, including hardware, permits and labor; required infrastructure, such as transformers, excavation and labor; shop tools, including the battery lift and drive unit cradle; and related improvements and operating costs.





In addition, conducting high voltage battery service requires tying up a second bay to work on the extracted battery for most models, along with higher service time variability due to parts availability and service frequency/comfort. Even excluding technician training investments and time, 50% of new vehicle dealers will not see enough EV service to recover their investments within three years until 2026.

What to do now





Given the disparity in regional density and the low presence of BEVs in the overall vehicle parc, independent tire dealers need to determine whether to be a regional champion, who actively captures the lion’s share of limited BEV activity in his or her area; a fast follower; or simply wait on the sidelines.





Similar to the historic expansions of European and Asian vehicles into the U.S. vehicle parc, opportunities will exist for dealers to capture an above-market share of BEV service, utilizing a combination of aggressive marketing and early investments, as high rates of tire wear will create opportunities.





Fast followers need to be ready to pursue traditional maintenance opportunities as they expand, but may leverage referral networks for higher investment and training items such as complete battery removal and repair in the mid-term, similar to ADAS calibration.

https://www.consultancy-me.com/news/5207/in-bahrains-sme-boardrooms-transformation-is-a-true-constant,"In Bahrain’s SME boardrooms, transformation is a true constant","Small and mid-sized companies in Bahrain are buckling up for a period of continued transformation, according to a new report by Roland Berger commissioned by the National Bank of Bahrain, as their leaders seek to navigate a ‘perfect storm’ of internal and external changes.

The report, which surveyed leaders of companies with less than €50 million in revenues (typically less than 500 employees), found that despite major black swan events such as Covid-19 and the Russia-Ukraine conflict (and broader geopolitical struggles), a high number of 77% of companies managed to ink black results over the past three years.

“Surprisingly, only 46% of firms flagged Covid-19 as having adversely affected their business and operations, and the majority (65%) of all firms say they have now successfully overcome pandemic-related challenges,” states the report.

Looking ahead, a little more than 8 out of 10 firms anticipate economic growth in the region, although only about 3 out of 10 anticipate strong growth.

Roland Berger’s survey took a broad look at the SME economy, surveying leaders from sectors including banking, trade, manufacturing, construction, and real estate, among others.

Transform or risk losing ground

Along with growth, transformation emerges as the top boardroom priority. While major transformation programs are known to be part of daily life at major corporates, the report demonstrates that in the tier below life is not much different.

The authors found that a staggering 83% of all companies have recently gone through a transformation program or are currently executing one. But it doesn’t stop there – 4 out of 5 firms already have a transformation agenda for the remainder of 2022 and 2023.

Asked why they are transforming, leaders mostly point at external factors such as changes to market dynamics, disruption from competitors or tech-driven new kids on the block, overall business uncertainty, black swan events, and changes in government policy.

“Without a doubt, the need for transformation is here to stay, and businesses have recognised this,” said Bruce Wade, Chief Executive – Group Financial Restructuring at the National Bank of Bahrain. “The ability to quickly adapt to changing business contexts and priorities is the one constant that should matter to any firm.”

So what are companies exactly transforming? It turns out that transformation is happening across the board, impacting strategic topics, but also operations, finance and more.

Operational transformation was part of 65% of all recent/ongoing transformation programs, followed by strategic revamp (53%). Transformation programs expected for 2022/2023 seem to prioritise strategic topics over operational excellence, with both ranking ahead of financial transformation geared towards debt and equity position.

From a functional perspective, customer growth is the number one business priority, and hence a key focus of transformation efforts. Rounding off the top five are financial growth, cost cutting, operational excellence and service/product optimisation.

Transformation initiatives are likely to be part of a broader portfolio (as many areas can be interlinked), with nearly 8 out of 10 leaders listing 3 priorities, and almost 4 out of 10 listing 5 priorities.

Bahrain the implementation champion?

Notably, the report by Roland Berger and the National Bank of Bahrain found that “about 8 out of 10 firms that have recently gone through a transformation program (or are currently executing one) consider this transformation program a success.”

For anyone in the world of transformation, this will undoubtedly raise some eyebrows. Sassan Hatam, a partner at Roland Berger who has advised on dozens of transformations, places the survey result into context. “This number might come as a surprise, as making change happen is difficult.”

“We haven’t explored the measure of success behind these numbers. In any case, in our experience a holistic transformation mindset often yields the best results. And an approach of continuous focus and improvement – transformation is a never-ending journey. It is a marathon with sprints in between.”

https://www.consultancy.eu/news/7278/roland-bergers-french-boss-released-from-duties-for-eric-zemmour-dinner,Roland Berger's French boss released from duties for Eric Zemmour dinner,"Global strategy consultancy Roland Berger has relieved its French leader of his duties, following his hosting of a dinner in support of a far-right political candidate. Olivier de Panafieu is understood to have organised a dinner for French presidential hopeful, Éric Zemmour, at his home.

Éric Zemmour is a French writer, essayist and a far-right politician. A former editor and panellist on Face à l'Info, a daily show broadcast on CNews, Zemmour is euphemistically referred to as a ‘polarising figure,’ though critics have less generously labelled him an “ultra-nationalist”, and a “TV-friendly fascist”, among other monikers.

Well known for his controversial views regarding immigration and Islam in France, Zemmour has extensively supported the “great replacement”, a theory contending that France’s native population will be replaced by non-European people. Despite this, when he announced his candidacy in the 2022 French presidential election in November, his name riding high in the polls.

Since then, support for Zemmour seems to have plateaued, with fellow far-right candidate Marine Le Pen and conservative independent Valérie Pécresse, while incumbent Emmanuel Macron’s support has stabilised following a dramatic drop early in 2021. Even so, businesses are extremely wary of being seen to support his policies – particularly while so many of them are championing diversity drives.

This is allegedly something which has led Roland Berger to discipline the head of its French operation. Roland Berger is a strategy consulting firm which regularly advises the French Government. On the firm’s website, a statement on diversity reads, “Open minded teams integrating people with diverse talent, nationalities, genders, religious or sexual orientations are key for our success. At Roland Berger, we foster an environment of respect where all colleagues feel welcome and accepted how they are.”

Investigative news organisation Mediapart revealed that Olivier de Panafieu was among business figures who organised private fund-raising dinners in their homes, to support Zemmour’s campaign. Soon after, reports from French news outlet La Lettre reported that Roland Berger’s Managing Partner for France was being removed from the role.

Responding to an email seeking comment, Roland Berger stated: “We have decided to release Olivier de Panafieu from all management duties at Roland Berger with immediate effect.” While the company declined to detail the rational behind its decision, multiple reports suggest the move is linked to Panafieu’s hosting of a pro-Zemmour event.

Panafieu has worked for Roland Berger since 2000, and was promoted to head of France in 2017. He has also been part of the management consultancy’s top management circle for three years. His removal as its French leader does not mean he necessarily has to leave the management consultancy, though. Roland Berger has also confirmed to the press that while he was relieved of all management tasks, that there was no separation beyond that.

This is not the only link between strategy consultants and the Zemmour campaign, though. According to Bloomberg, campaign director Bertrand de la Chesnais was a Senior Advisor at Roland Berger until October, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Meanwhile, beyond the consulting industry, Mediapart also reported that Zemmour had secured political donations from executives in banks and hedge funds, lawyers and property developers are among other backers.

https://www.railjournal.com/in_depth/continued-growth-in-uncertain-times-shows-rails-resilience/,Continued growth in uncertain times shows rail's resilience,"THE European Rail Industry Association’s (Unife) World Rail Market Study published in September projects a stable 3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) excluding inflation to achieve an annual market volume of €210.6bn for the 2025-2027 period. This compares with an average of €177bn per year in 2019-2021.

Global commitments to achieve net zero carbon emissions linked to environmental and stimulus programmes such as the European Union (EU) Green Deal and Recovery and Resilience Facility, and the US Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, are supporting further significant investment in rail projects.

Across the 65 countries in the study, representing 98% of global rail passenger and freight traffic, the installed base of rolling stock totals about 6.1 million units. The total infrastructure analysed accounts for around 1.75 million kilometres of track. Driven by Asia Pacific growth, worldwide infrastructure in operation grew by around 39,000km or 2.3% compared with 2019.

Asia Pacific has also been the leader in deploying 300-350km/h trains, while Asia Pacific and Europe lead in deploying 220-299km/h trains. The urban transport market grew by 12% during the past two years.

While almost all regions, except for the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) covering Russia and Central Asia, are expected to grow in the future, the highest growth rates of 7.1% and 6.1% are forecast in the relatively small markets of Africa/Middle East and Eastern Europe. However, more mature markets like Western Europe, Asia Pacific and North America will also grow significantly and account for the largest share of absolute growth.

With the African population expected to grow strongly in the next few decades, the demand for better urban and interurban transport will increase significantly. Moreover, the establishment of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) is expected to boost trade. Therefore, rail has huge growth potential due to its ability to carry large volumes of freight efficiently. To benefit from this, governments can actively support the local rail supply industry by providing foreign loans. For Europe, the new Global Gateway scheme could enhance the economic relationship with Africa.

The largest contribution to overall global growth in absolute terms is predicted for services (2.8%), rolling stock (2.5%) and infrastructure (3.8%), which together account for 89% of current market volume. Train control is expected to grow at 3.4%, while turnkey management is expected to have a CAGR of 4.8%.

Infrastructure

The study observes that infrastructure growth will be driven by strong growth in the 300-350km/h rail and urban rail markets followed by mainline track renewal and extension. Regarding rolling stock, high-speed trains will lead demand followed by multiple units, while locomotive-hauled coaches is the only segment in decline. Train control will continue to grow driven by the demand for ATP (including CBTC) and ERTMS deployment. Ambitious EU targets to achieve full ERTMS deployment on the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) corridors by 2040 will play a key role. With a growing installed base, services will drive growth with spare parts, maintenance, and the introduction of Digital Automatic Couplers (DAC) which will have a very positive impact for Europe.

Overall, worldwide rail market accessibility has declined during the last decade due to higher content requirements and revamped market access barriers resulting in the exclusion of European suppliers from key markets. Indeed, average total market accessibility decreased from around 70% in 2008 to 61% today. The missed business opportunity between total and accessible market increased during the last decade from €47.9bn per year to €69.6bn.

The rail industry is undergoing a transformation driven by digitalisation. Increased investment in train control technologies such as ERTMS will be key to achieving a truly interoperable railway and increasing international connectivity. Asia Pacific and Western Europe are expected to remain the largest markets for train control, accounting for 75% of the total future market while Africa Middle/East and Eastern Europe are predicted to have the highest relative growth at 8.2% and 6.8% per year.

Alternative propulsion solutions like battery-only, fuel cell and diesel-battery and bi-mode have been part of the study since 2020. The number of alternative propulsion units increased by 674 units or 20%, resulting in 4137 alternative propulsion units in operation, with Western Europe accounting for approximately 90%. EU legislative discussions are setting the path towards full decarbonisation and the EU Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation proposal is an opportunity to establish a European legal framework to support the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure for rail, especially for TEN-T lines that will not be electrified.",[],

In fact, current annual levels of 1 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions had appeared likely to quadruple by 2050, but now emission levels are set to fall during 2020, followed by some “muted growth” anticipated for the next few years, according to a new study released by the company on Tuesday during the FIA Connect event.

However, according to project manager Nikhil Sachdeva, CO2 emissions are not the only challenging aspect of aviation’s environmental footprint. Factoring in other contaminants such as oxides from nitrogen, water vapor, sulfites, soot, contrails, and aviation-induced cloudiness, the sector’s impact could end up three times higher than that of CO2 alone by 2050.

In Roland Berger’s view, the industry needs to take an urgent and multi-pronged approach if will have any chance of achieving a widely shared stated objective of so-called net zero emissions in the next 30 years. The company has published a road map for the key steps that it advocates the industry follows.

First, explained Sachdeva, airlines must continue replacing older, less efficient aircraft in their fleets with new models like the Boeing 737 Max and Airbus A320neo, which deliver around a 15 percent reduction in fuel burn. He acknowledged that the immediate fallout from Covid has dampened fleet replacement plans but said that the industry cannot abandon the effort for long. The company estimates that the measure could deliver an overall 25 percent cut in emissions.

As a second step, Roland Berger said that authorities must reform air traffic management to make more efficient use of available airspace, both in terms of route and altitude optimization. While that could marginally increase fuel burn, the moves would contribute to a 10 percent overall reduction in emissions, said the consultancy.

The Roland Berger report spells out how the industry could achieve a 15 percent improvement from each of the following measures: optimizing flight trajectories; introducing battery-based electric aircraft for flights of up to 1,500 km (as long as they are recharged with renewable energy); and introducing hybrid-electric (with sustainable aviation fuel) and/or hydrogen-powered aircraft.

The company estimates that switching to sustainable aviation fuel for longer-haul flights could yield another 10 percent savings in emissions. That would leave another 10 percent portion of current emissions that would need to be nullified by paying for carbon offsets.

According to Roland Berger partner Uwe Weichenhain, hydrogen carries significant potential to improve aviation’s environmental performance if industry can overcome various challenges, such as cost and lack of infrastructure. In his view, hydrogen fuel cell-based propulsion systems are the most practical for aircraft seating fewer than 100 passengers, while hydrogen combustion systems will work best for larger aircraft.

Last week, the European Commission committed €300 billion to support a comprehensive, multi-industry program to boost the availability of so-called green hydrogen (i.e. produced in sustainable ways). As things stand, Weichenhain said there is insufficient capacity to produce enough green hydrogen for widespread aviation use, but he sees that situation changing after 2030, with prices coming down in the process.",[],2020-07-21 00:00:00
https://www.consultancy.eu/news/2966/charles-edouard-bouee-steps-down-as-ceo-of-roland-berger,Charles-Edouard Bouée steps down as CEO of Roland Berger,"Roland Berger’s chief executive officer, Charles-Edouard Bouée, in his second term at the helm of the global management consulting firm, has stepped down as he seeks to take on “new opportunities”.

“Having worked 25 years in consultancy, I am all set to turn this invaluable experience and expertise into an entrepreneurial practice. I'm thrilled to be heading for new endeavours.”

Charles-Édouard Bouée joined Roland Berger eighteen years ago, having previously served A.T. Kearney in France and Société Générale in London. At Roland Berger, Bouée held a range of leadership positions prior to ascending to the top role. He first focused on clients in France, but after he relocated to China in 2006 to lead the firm’s China office his focus shifted to Asia.

In 2009 he was appointed regional head of Roland Berger Asia, and later on he assumed responsibility for the firm’s France, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Morocco region. In the summer of 2014, he was named CEO, becoming the first non-German leader since Roland Berger was founded by company namesake in 1967 in Munich. Five years down the line, and a year into his second term as CEO, Bouée believes that the time is right to pursue his next career step. While not revealing his next move, he has shared on social network LinkedIn that he will operate in an entrepreneurial setting with a focus on digitisation and artificial intelligence. “Globalisation and digitisation are turning the world upside down – offering unparalleled opportunities that I wish to explore and seize.”



Speaking of his tenure at the consultancy, Bouée said gratefully, “It has been an incredible journey with Roland Berger: I sincerely thank my colleagues, clients and partners for all the confidence & commitment, passion & persistence, adventures & achievements we shared along the way. I learned so much from all of you all over the world, I lived fully as a leader, a consultant and a person, I loved the things I did as well as the people I interacted with.”

Record performance

Another reason for his premature timing – which has surprised Roland Berger and is uncommon under CEOs of strategy consulting firms – lies in Roland Berger’s development. When the Frenchman took the reins in 2014, Roland Berger found itself in a delicate situation. In the years previous, the firm faced financial challenges, and nearly lost its independence as a result. Deutsche Bank and founder Roland Berger had to inject millions into the company to maintain its healthy status during the financial crisis years, with the developments at what is regarded as Europe’s most prestigious home-grown consultancy closely watched by rivals. In 2010, Deloitte Consulting came close to acquiring the outfit, and three years later, Roland Berger just managed to fend-off interest from Deloitte Consulting, PwC and KPMG.

While the likes of Monitor Group (Deloitte, now Monitor Deloitte), Booz & Company (PwC, now Strategy&) and The Parthenon Group (EY, now EY-Parthenon) decided to join the larger muscle of the Big Four, Roland Berger firmly held on to its independent, partnership-led strategy. Bouée played an instrumental role in solidifying this strategy – he launched a new corporate strategy, optimised the firm’s global footprint, and returned the firm to growth and profitability. Last year was the crown of his work, with the firm looking back at “its best ever financial year”, confirmed Marcus Berret, Chairman of Roland Berger’s Supervisory Board.

“We thank Charles-Edouard for his strong contributions to our firm over the past 18 years, and especially for the energising role he played in bringing our firm back on a growth track. He has been one of the engines behind our transformation.”

Deputy CEO Stefan Schaible has taken on Bouée’s tasks on an interim basis, supported by a global management team consisting of Tijo Collot d'Escury (Managing Partner of the Netherlands), Sascha Haghani (Managing Partner of Germany, Austria and Switzerland), Satoshi Nagashima (Managing Partner of Japan), and Olivier de Panafieu (Co-Managing Partner of France). “We are aiming for another record year in 2019,” highlighted Schaible.

Bouée remains affiliated with the firm as a strategic advisor. “We are happy to benefit from his experience in an advisory role,” said Berret.

Eyad Faraj joins Roland Berger from outside the consulting industry. Appointed a partner in Manama, Faraj has been tasked with growing the firm’s footprint in the Bahrain market. He brings two decades of experience in investment banking, private equity, and capital markets.

Faraj most recently was a Director at Sayacorp, a Bahrain based Islamic Investment firm where he led and managed investments within consumer staples, healthcare, and education. Before that, he spent close to a decade at powerhouse investment banks Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch in Dubai.

An MBA holder from INSEAD, Faraj kicked off his career in the US at a pharmaceuticals company before relocating to Bahrain to serve Gulf International Bank.

Mazen Stetie returns to Roland Berger having previously served the strategy consulting firm for three years around a decade ago. In between, he worked as an independent consultant (among others affiliated to Roland Berger) and most recently worked for Digital14, a hi-tech player in the defense and cyber security space, where he led the financial intelligence and analytics unit over a period of five years.

His consulting track record includes delivering projects in the private and public sectors, focusing on corporate finance, investments and transformation. Prior to consulting, Stetie (a graduate of the American University of Beirut) started his career in telecom and startups.

Richard Stolz brings over a decade of management consulting in the GCC to the firm. Having started his career at Accenture in its Strategy & Consulting division in London, Stolz moved to Dubai in 2013.

During his nine years at Accenture, GRMC Advisory Services and KPMG, Stolz has advised private and public organizations on sector strategy, growth, price and fee competitiveness, forecast reviews, organisational effectiveness and customer journey experience. He focuses on clients in the tourism, travel, leisure and aviation sectors.

Charles Menkhorst, the most experienced of the quartet of new joiners, joins Roland Berger’s senior advisor network in the region, which also includes the likes of Lewis Kenney and Susanna Mason, who where welcomed earlier this year.

Menkhorst is a veteran of the Ports & Logistics industry, having most recently served as the CEO of Gulftainer, a regional container business. Before that, he was CEO of Euroports (20+ terminals across Europe) for nine years. Earlier, he spent 15 years at DHL, growing the ranks in the US and Europe before relocating to the Middle East to take the reins for the Africa, Middle East & India division of APM Terminals.

At Roland Berger, Menkhorst will provide advisory services to clients and the firm’s engagement teams in the ports & logistics sectors.

Faraj and Stetie are both member of Roland Berger’s Investor Support practice (which advises corporates and private equity clients on deal-driven growth and transactions), while Stolz joins the Regulated & Infrastructure practice.

Commenting on the additions, Rene Seyger, Managing Partner at Roland Berger in the Middle East, said: “We are excited that Eyad, Mazen, Richard, and Charles are joining us. They strengthen our knowledge and expertise and will reinforce our competences to serve our clients and their needs at the best.”

The Corporate Finance practice of Roland Berger supports clients worldwide with a range of M&A-related services, including strategic work, due diligence, and integration planning. In the due diligence space, the firm’s consultants are predominantly active in two areas: commercial due diligence and operational due diligence.

A commercial due diligence (CDD) is conducted by a corporation or private equity firm prior to the negotiation phase, and provides a detailed insight into the commercial attractiveness of a target. The analysis sheds light on the target's internal and external environment, highlighting potential threats and opportunities, and provides a deep understanding of the target company's position. Factors looked at include the attractiveness and sustainability of a business model, the likelihood of future cash flows and financial forecasts, and potential commercial synergies and risks following a merger / acquisition.

An operational due diligence (ODD) meanwhile looks at all operational aspects of a target organisation, including topics such as supply chain and manufacturing vulnerability, IT infrastructure and cybersecurity, the robustness of internal operations & processes, and the HR organisation. Operational due diligence studies also scrutinise topics such as the composition and nature of the cost structure, capital expenditures and risk management, as well as the impact of the deal on potential performance improvement and synergy plans.

Due diligence track record

Analysis of Roland Berger’s dealmaking database shows that the firm’s French country team has been involved with over 320 CDDs and ODDs in the past 36 months, surprisingly outranking its German team in deal volume. The DACH region, comprising the M&A team’s of Germany, Austria and Switzerland, contributed to 288 deals in the period, with the Benelux – the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg – and UK teams also enjoying over 100 successfully closed deals on their books.

In Asia, Roland Berger completed 137 deals in the period, with a focus on automotive. The consulting firm serves the region through offices in eight countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, Japan, South Korea and China. The Nordics, North America and Italy are other key M&A markets for the consultancy, with all three regions adding over 50 deals to the total.

Roland Berger’s Corporate Finance practice is led by Germany-based senior partner Sascha Haghani and France-based senior partner Olivier de Panafieu.

Other types of due diligence projects include: financial due diligence (FDD – focus on financials), IT due diligence (ITDD – focus on the IT environment), human capital due diligence (HCDD – analysis of human capital), and an intellectual capital due diligence (ICDD – focus on intellectual capital and property).",[],2019-09-09 07:44:00+00:00
https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/roland-berger-global-semiconductor-shortage-to-persist-for-several-years-beyond-2022/,Roland Berger: Global semiconductor shortage to persist for several years beyond 2022,"Chip demand set to rise 17% per year from 2020 to 2022, while supply will grow only 6% per year

The global semiconductor shortage is expected to last beyond 2022 for the automotive industry and many other sectors and will continue for several years. The biggest shortages are seen in older generation chips, the legacy semiconductors on which the automotive industry is reliant. But additional manufacturing capacities are mainly being built up in newer generations, meaning that these investments will offer little relief. These are among the key findings of the study “Steering through the semiconductor crisis. A sustained structural disruption requires strategic responses by the automotive industry” by Roland Berger.

“The gap between semiconductor supply and demand is getting bigger and bigger,” says Falk Meissner, Partner at Roland Berger. “There is no improvement in prospect anytime soon. That is because the reasons for the supply crunch are structural and related to the way supply chains are currently set up. The shortage of chips will persist into 2023 – and probably beyond. The capacity expansions that have been announced are not enough to meet demand.”

Current demand for chips exceeds production capacity by far

The Roland Berger experts’ analyses indicate that chip demand will increase by 17% per year from 2020 to 2022. Yet production capacity will rise by only 6% per year in the same period. Logic (40nm nodes and older), analog chips and MEMS are the semiconductor segments where the shortages are expected to persist the longest. With semiconductor factories already running at 97% capacity on average, a rapid expansion of production is not realistically possible.

Added to that, some car manufacturers are already switching from a just-in-time to a just-in-case approach and thus overstocking semiconductors. In the short term, this aggravates the supply shortage even more.

Transformation in semiconductor architecture

New manufacturing capacity is not going to resolve the massive supply shortage in the automotive industry because the investment is focused mainly on the latest generation of leading-edge nodes. Yet the older generation chips are where the biggest shortages are – where manufacturing technology dates from the 1990s and 2000s. It is these that make up the lion’s share of semiconductors in the current electronics architectures of cars with internal combustion engines, accounting for 95% of the chips installed. By contrast, latest generation chips account for just 5%.

The automotive industry is already in the process of transitioning to new electronic vehicle architectures. Technology and automotive company experts interviewed for the study believe it will take traditional manufacturers more than five years to complete the transition.

Semiconductor customers will need to adapt their strategy

Companies from the automotive industry and other sectors that rely on semiconductors need to actively address the crisis. This will include taking technical measures such as transitioning more quickly to centralized/zonal E/E architectures. In addition, direct, long-term supply contracts with semiconductor companies that include reciprocal capacity commitments and purchase obligations over several years are an important lever. “In the long term, OEMs and suppliers must adapt their design philosophies to keep pace with the dynamic capacity changes in the semiconductor industry. Addressing the crisis requires strategic action,” so Meissner.

With over 230 franchisee operated sales outlets, New York Pizza is the second largest player in the Dutch market. Last year these outlets sold 11.5 million pizza’s, generating more than €54 million in sales.

By joining forces with Orkla, a listed Norwegian supplier of consumer goods, bakery, snacks and personal care products with over 21,000 employees, New York Pizza aims to accelerate its internationalisation strategy. The chain recently entered the Belgian market (New York Pizza plans to have six outlets by the end of the year) and is active with two sales outlets in Cologne, Germany.

“This is an important step forward that will enable us to further scale the business model,” explained Philippe Vorst, CEO of New York Pizza. “We are looking forward to working with them to realise the company’s international growth potential.”

Amstelveen-headquartered New York Pizza has sold 75% of its shares to the Norwegians, with the remaining 25% of shares in the hands of the current shareholders.

The deal was advised on by M&A consultants from several consultancies. Orkla hired Roland Berger to conduct a commercial due diligence on New York Pizza and its growth outlook. Other consulting firms that supported the transaction were Axeco (a Dutch M&A advisory) and Big Four firm Deloitte.

Meanwhile, legal advisory was provided by Houthoff, Florent, Buren, and Maverick Advocaten, while JSA Tax delivered tax advisory work. Both New York Pizza and Orkla also had an inhouse team that contributed to the deal.

Jaan Ivar Semlitsch, President and CEO of Orkla said: “This acquisition is aligned with Orkla’s strategic ambition of growing in the Out-of-Home segment, which has higher growth than the traditional grocery channel. We are delighted with the addition, New York Pizza is a well-run company with a well-functioning franchise model.

The deal includes Euro Pizza Products, a subsidiary of New York Pizza that manufactures pizza dough. This unit supplies New York Pizza with dough and other pizza ingredients and condiments, but also operates a standalone sales business, exporting to customers in 18 European countries.

https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/roland-berger-rising-demand-for-lithium-ion-batteries-may-lead-to-shortages-in-raw-material-supply/,Roland Berger: Rising demand for lithium-ion batteries may lead to shortages in raw material supply,"Interest in battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is growing rapidly. In 2021, electric cars account for only 4 percent of the global passenger vehicle sales

Interest in battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is growing rapidly. In 2021, electric cars account for only 4 percent of the global passenger vehicle sales. By 2030, this figure is expected to rise to over 30 percent. However, such a strong increase in demand will create new risks for the lithium-ion battery supply chain, particularly around the availability of raw materials. In the new publication “The lithium-ion (EV) battery market and supply chain”, Roland Berger analyzes these challenges and shows how companies can overcome them.

“The battery pack is a key component of electric mobility. The cost depends on the precise cell technology used, where the battery is produced and to a very large extent on the price of the raw materials,” says Wolfgang Bernhart, Partner at Roland Berger. “Increased raw material costs have already made electric car batteries massively more expensive to produce in recent months. The war in Ukraine is exacerbating things even further. While this will not halt the trend towards electric vehicles, it may slow it down.”

New risks in the supply chain

The global lithium-ion battery market is expected to show an annual growth of 30 percent through to 2030. The increase in production will significantly add to the strain on the battery supply chain. Most critical is the dependency on certain raw and refined materials such as cobalt and nickel sulphates as well as lithium. These materials account for more than 30 percent of the cell costs, with cells in turn making up about 75 percent of the total cost of the battery pack.

In this publication, Roland Berger experts identify four main areas of supply chain risks:

Geopolitical factors: The extraction and processing of crucial resources like lithium is concentrated in a small number of countries. About one-tenth of all nickel comes from Russia – thus leading to massive price reactions on the commodity markets with the beginning of the war in Ukraine.

ESG: Battery manufacturing has a significant environmental and social impact. Lithium extraction uses high quantities of water and some production processes emit large amounts of CO2.

Price: Next to the fluctuating raw material prices, the costs of the additional production capacities in the “mine to cell” value chain must also be considered. Capital expenditure of EUR 250-300 billion over the next eight years is forecast, a third of which will go towards meeting European demand.

Supply: The availability of certain materials will become critical. Shortages of both a temporary and a long-term nature are expected for nickel and cobalt or their sulphates, and for lithium in particular.

Countering shortages with recycling, regionalization and vertical integration of raw material supply

Avoiding these shortfalls will require changes throughout the entire battery supply chain. “On a production level, an integrated approach between metallurgy and chemistry will help reduce costs,” states Bernhart. “Greater regionalization and co-location of multiple steps in battery manufacturing can also mitigate geopolitical and ESG risks. Recycling, too, will take on an increasingly important role from the end of the decade onward.”

As regulatory requirements evolve, companies throughout the value chain will find themselves more and more obligated to implement a circular battery economy. The potentially recoverable materials from batteries will be vital in ensuring that supply can meet the rising demand. “Strategically, OEMs and battery manufacturers can also increase their involvement in the upstream supply chain. This may range from long-term supply agreements to partnerships or investments,” says Bernhart. “Positioning oneself at all critical control points along the supply chain is a complex and costly undertaking, but it will provide a strong competitive advantage.”

https://readme.lk/study-by-edotco-and-roland-berger-on-towercos-economic-growth-potential-for-emerging-markets/,Study by edotco and Roland Berger on TowerCos economic growth potential for emerging markets,"The edotco Group, a leading integrated telecommunications infrastructure services company in Asia, launched a study in collaboration with Roland Berger titled, ‘Towering Above: Building Tomorrow’s Digital Infrastructure in Asia’. The study estimates that Tower Companies (TowerCos) can help Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) save up to USD 10 billion through infrastructure sharing and result in cumulative savings of up to USD 67 billion for consumers due to affordable 5G connectivity by 2025. Further, the study also shows that TowerCos can enable sustainable digital connectivity by reducing up to 17 million metric tonnes in carbon footprint by 2025.

The report, launched during a panel discussion featuring edotco, Roland Berger, and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), explores the critical roles and potential impact of TowerCos across nine key Asian markets – Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Philippines, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Sri Lanka. The report also demonstrates how TowerCos are stimulating sustainable digital connectivity to realize incremental socio-economic benefits for industries, societies, and governments, in addition to assessing how key policies and regulatory reform recommendations can unlock such opportunities.

TowerCos and MNOs in the next normal

According to the report, digital infrastructure is becoming a critical digital economy enabler, with 5G expected to transform the industry. TowerCos are now transforming their roles to become digital infrastructure providers, in addition to working closely with industry stakeholders to undertake deeper forms of active infrastructure sharing. Not only are these services critical to stimulate development during the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, but such partnerships are also crucial for preparing economies for the 5G era – an age that could potentially further revolutionize network usage and unlock new opportunities while easing the MNOs’ investment and deployment challenges.

“While MNOs are rapidly expanding their network in low Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) markets such as Asia, they face a significant challenge in keeping their cost per GB under control while striving to meet the industry demands and adhering to regulators’ intended policy and regulatory outcomes. These can only be addressed sustainably through a higher degree of infrastructure sharing,” said Gayan Koralage, Director of Group Strategy, edotco Group.

The report also noted that – despite Southeast Asia and South Asia being among the fastest-growing sub-regions in terms of average data usage per user – MNOs have not been able to capitalize on the traffic trend. This is causing the continuous decline in ARPU, making it challenging for MNOs to generate returns that are commensurate with their cost of capital. “In overcoming the MNOs’ investment conundrums, solutions based on software-defined networking and a stronger partnership with next-generation TowerCos can foster greater scalability, speed, and cost advantages. Such partnerships are rapidly unfolding in developed markets, showcasing the TowerCos’ emerging catalytic roles in business, society, and the environment,” he added.

Regulatory reforms are required to drive growth and multiply socio-economic benefits

The study further notes that leading TowerCos are poised to assist MNOs by moving up the value chain. Namely, this is by offering innovative 5G-enabled solutions such as OpenRAN, Network-as-a-Service solutions, and Edge Computing to help MNOs achieve greater cost- and network efficiency. “Given today’s telecommunications industry dynamics, TowerCos must evolve to become active digital infrastructure providers to provide the needed industry scalability, efficiency, and flexibility. However, the right regulatory environment is needed with five policy reforms critical to power growth: strong digital infrastructure mandate, conducive licensing & ownership regime, the active promotion of infra sharing, streamlined process, and enablement of adjacent services,” stated Damien Dujacquier, Managing Partner of SEA, Roland Berger.

This also notes that forward-looking regulatory reforms and policy changes are needed for TowerCos to realize its potential in the next normal. These include providing incentives and introducing a more conducive regulatory framework for TowerCos to explore more innovative partnerships and services.

Lennart Bösch and Marc Hesse have been promoted into the partnership, Dennis Bücker and Maximilian Dressler have been hired externally.

Lennart Bösch has been with Roland Berger since 2019, when he re-joined the consulting firm following a spell at French-German startup as an executive. Previously, Bösch worked between 2010 and 2017 for Roland Berger.

A member of the firm’s Life Sciences practice, Bösch has an extensive track record working with pharmaceutical companies as well as physician chains on topics including strategic planning, market access, organisational and commercialisation strategies, and digital innovation.

Munich-based Hesse focuses on the evaluation of investment opportunities (commercial due diligence, target screening), value creation (strategy development, buy-and-build, synergy identification, cost reduction measures) as well as exit support (vendor commercial due diligence, equity story) for corporate and private equity clients.

Dennis Bücker re-joins Roland Berger as a partner in its Restructuring practice. He first joined the consultancy in 2010, having previously served M&A specialist Clearwater International and KPMG in its Transactions & Restructuring practice. He then had two more spells at the firm, interrupted by a period as CEO of food & beverage company Wein & Vinos and most recently, Managing Director of LeanOne.

Having fulfilled the role for two years, Regina Körner has moved on to take on a new challenge outside the firm, with the internally promoted Eike Alexander Kraft tasked with filling her shoes.

“Roland Berger is growing, and our marketing function is an important driver,” said Charles-Edouard Bouée, CEO of Roland Berger on the importance of marketing to the firm. His view is echoed by a recently released analysis on the value of marketing to consultancies, finding that high growth consulting firms invest more in marketing than their slower growing peers.

Founded in 1967 by namesake Roland Berger, the consulting firm today is one of the globe’s top strategic consultancies. The company, headquartered in Munich, has around 2,400 consultants in 30+ countries generating a fee income of over €600 million.

Alongside supporting clients with their most pressing matters, Roland Berger is a strong producer of thought leadership and in-depth analysis. The firm’s marketing function is tasked with leading the marketing agenda aligned to the corporate strategy, and the dissemination of content globally to outlets including newspapers, magazines, platforms and offline channels.

Following two years at the helm of the marketing team, Regina Körner has decided to pursue new career opportunities. Her successor is Eike Alexander Kraft, who has been with the management consultancy since 2017. In the past two years, Kraft led Roland Berger’s Global Newsroom, which coordinates the firm’s teams for Communications and PR, Events, Digital, Content and Media Design.

Kraft previously served AccorHotels, where he was responsible for the communication activities in Germany and Central Europe, and Germany’s Department of Defence as a press officer.

Under Kraft’s direction, Roland Berger continued its international harmonisation drive in the marketing function, and shifted to a topic-focused 360 degree approach while bolstering its digital footprint amid growing importance for digital channels and social media. “Eike has excelled in developing our Newsroom, making him the right internal re-staffing leader for our marketing team,” commented Bouée.

One of Kraft’s first major tasks is leading Roland Berger’s marketing and PR efforts developed for this week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, an event which brings together leaders from across the globe – politicians, business executives, civil society and academia – to shape the future of economy and society. A first-timer at Davos, Roland Berger’s new Marketing & Communications lead said, “A few very exciting days are ahead. Looking forward to new insights, extraordinary experiences and good conversations accompanying our CEO.”

https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-08-27/Roland-Berger-China-s-manufacturing-has-been-consistent-TiFtBfvGXS/index.html,Roland Berger: China's manufacturing has been consistent,"Chinese manufacturers have been consistent in catering to the global demand in various sectors despite fears of a recalibration of the global supply chain triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, said strategic consultant firm Roland Berger on Thursday.

Citing the automotive and aerospace sectors, Denis Depoux, global managing director at Roland Berger, said the coronavirus pandemic had disrupted global supplies elsewhere, but Chinese suppliers continued to be ""up and running.""

With all the noise of the supply chain possibly leaving China, there is certainty in many sectors. ""There is consistency of the Chinese manufacturing sector being able to serve the world, and we're seeing this while some supply chains in other parts of the world are still being disrupted,"" Depoux told CGTN in an interview.

On Wednesday, official data showed that China's manufacturing sector expanded for a third straight month in July, with profits up 19.6 percent year on year, following an 11.5-percent increase in June. This was also the fastest pace in two years.

Pent-up demand, government stimulus and resilient exports contributed to the growth, but some signs of weakness have emerged, as floods and torrential rains weakened activity. Analysts also said Chinese factories face risks from increasingly tense ties with the U.S. that could impact overseas orders.

'Be cautious over China's recovery'

Meanwhile, Depoux said the ""incredible"" growth of China's industrial profits should be taken with caution as it grew from a low base.

""What we are seeing is a catch-up effect from the beginning of the year. Let's be a bit cautious. But still the results are amazing. A lot of the negative effect that was coming from the first half of the year came from resources. That's coming back,"" he said, adding that mineral and coal prices are returning to pre-crisis levels.

Depoux also said China has seen positive signs with stimulus-driven infrastructure investments and an increase in manufacturing demand.

""A good indicator is looking at people manufacturing machine tools. That's sold out over the next few months. That's a sign of renewed investment to face global demand that is coming back,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Depoux said global economic uncertainty will remain for the rest of the year given the U.S. election in November and trade tensions. ""I think the uncertainty will certainly remain throughout the end of the year and next year.""","[""Cgtn'S Global Business""]",2020-08-27 00:00:00
https://www.globalconstructionreview.com/germanys-roland-berger-manage-15bn-myanmar-develop/,Germany’s Roland Berger to manage $1.5bn Myanmar development,"The New Yangon City Development Company has hired German consultant Roland Berger to manage the procurement process for a $1.5bn urban quarter to be built on the west side of the Yangon River.

The 8,100ha industrial-commercial zone was to have been built as a single project by China Communications Construction Company (CCCC).

However, after criticism of the lack of competition and transparency in the awarding of the deal, the Myanmar government has split the scheme into smaller projects and opened them to a more competitive ""Swiss challenge"" bid system.

This lets a public authority accept a bid while inviting other bidders to come forward. If a challenge succeeds, the winning company reimburses the original bidder’s costs.

Phases one and two of the planned new city (NYDC)

Munich-based Roland Berger will manage the compartmentalisation of the new zone, and will also run any Swiss challenges that emerge.

The first phase will comprise a 3-sq-km industrial zone and a bridge to connect New Yangon with the old city across the river.

There will also be a 9-sq-km residential area and resettlement zones for those displaced by the scheme. The cost of this phase is thought to be about $800m.

It was announced in July that three international consultants were in the running for the contract to manage the scheme.

https://www.consultancy-me.com/news/3622/how-roland-berger-helps-young-strategy-consultants-learn-fast,How Roland Berger helps young strategy consultants learn fast,"The strategy consulting sector is renowned for its steep learning curve and entrepreneurial spirit. Junior Consultants Jana Farhat and Sidar Alagoz both work at Roland Berger in the Middle East – they spoke with Consultancy.org about their experiences in the industry and with the firm.

The consulting industry is one of the most popular among graduates looking to jump-start their post-academic careers. According to one estimate from Universum, between 15% to 20% of graduates worldwide would love to enter the industry – with challenging work, compelling projects, a diversity of industries and clients all being cited as reasons for heading into consulting.

In particular, many of the best and brightest graduates are drawn to the strategy segment of the consulting sector. According to Sidar, a Junior Consultant with Roland Berger, life at the firm has already imbued him with a wealth of knowledge which will serve him well throughout his career. Having initially studied in Italy, beginning his Masters in London led to an encounter with a Roland Berger partner at a recruitment event, and the rest soon fell into place.

He explained, “We had a nice chat about politics, different industries, and suddenly I realised that I wanted to be part of the firm. This was different from the other recruitment events I had been to. I was really engaged, and I want simply to be in a place where I am engaged all the time.”

Sidar initially studied finance and economics, then financial analysis, and confesses to still being “deeply in love with financial statements,” however, he soon realised that life with a strategy consulting firm would equip him with a different skill-set that could compliment that knowhow. Thanks to the challenging work and big responsibilities Roland Berger hands to young consultants, he has already started to develop these abilities.

“I enjoy being entrepreneurial,” he elaborated, “navigating ambiguity by finding my own solutions to some of the most pressing challenges in the economy and society. Strategy consulting gives you these responsibilities early on, in your 20s, and teaches all these skills to you in a rigorous fashion.”

Learning curve

Jana started with Roland Berger on the same day as Sidar, in September 2019. Having initially joined as an Intern while studying at the American University of Beirut, she was offered a job upon graduating, and is now a Junior Consultant with the firm. Similarly, she was quick to enjoy the benefits of the steep learning curve.

She expanded, “I learned about the Middle East, about regulations, public entities, about how things work there, before specialising in certain industries. I have been learning a lot about healthcare for example, the main pillars, dynamics, governance, and more.”

Meanwhile, the spell at Roland Berger has enabled her to build skills in strategic analysis and financial modelling – “I studied mechanical engineering – so everything I have learned related to ‘business’ has come from my time with Roland Berger.”

As well as on-the-job learning, Roland Berger’s close-knit team has supported both Jana and Sidar with extensive training as well. After kick-off training which lasted a week, side training then commences at varying intervals, with experienced consultants offering new recruits skills or industry training. Meanwhile, new members are encouraged to ask questions regularly to pick up best practices from their surrounding team members – something Jana said is “the way we learn the most.”

At the same time, the firm’s entrepreneurial spirit means that team members are encouraged to develop training sessions on new trends which they think might shape the future of their work. According to Sidar, this can help give employees an edge with future work, even if current projects do not involve such trends.

“This is a company where you can come, take the stand, speak and no-one will try to block you – there are no hundred-page manuals,” he asserted. “You say, ‘I want to do it,’ and you can go out there and do the training. For instance, a colleague of ours put on a training for sustainable finance, directed by himself – and he’d only been in the firm for one year.”

“I’m convinced that this is a unique feat at Roland Berger – and this a major aspect I like about the firm. The firm’s consultants all enjoy an intellectual challenge and are pragmatic and open in how they share knowledge with team members.”

Lockdown connections

The formerly travel-intensive consulting industry relied heavily on in-person work prior to the coronavirus outbreak. As a result, many firms initially struggled with the transition to remote working; however, Roland Berger soon managed to adapt to the ‘new normal.’

Jana noted, “When the pandemic first hit, it was difficult, especially for our clients, who had to cope with being offline. In my case for example, I was on an implementation project and the client would really appreciate the team being on the ground, which we couldn’t – however we quickly came up with a contingency plan; a really structured way on how to manage an implementation project remotely.”

In terms of internal life with Roland Berger, meanwhile, the firm was also aware that it would need to quickly shift to maintain its networks of support and knowledge sharing on a remote basis. The company started having bi-weekly office calls, and so instead of the pre-Covid-19 era meetings and office lunches, the company used these remote sessions to update teams about the business, the pandemic and travel, while confirming what could still be expected of staff, and offering support to help them meet those demands.

According to Sidar, the crisis may have actually brought out the very best from the firm. On the project side, “we are consultants – we are agile! Put us into a difficult position and we can still succeed,” he argued, before suggesting as people felt “these are hard times, we need to deliver more” they had pushed harder for their clients. On the team-building side, meanwhile, Roland Berger did a thorough job of protecting its entrepreneurial and supportive culture.

“We were each given an allowance to build a home-office space,” Sidar continued. “At the same time, we tried to make the office available [for those who could not work at home] by keeping measures really strict – so in a healthy way people could visit the office to not lose the touch. And through various events we stayed connected.

Roland Berger quickly adapted the communication and made the shift to working remotely smooth for its members, focusing on enabling a connection with both clients as well as colleagues. As Jana said, “we have links between different people, regardless of seniority, and we keep in touch to make sure we are feeling well and supported. We have a hybrid approach to things now, which will go forward even in the post-Covid-19 era.”

In the intervening years, Müller-Sarmiento worked for hypermarket Real, initially as a member of the management board and from 2016 onwards, as chief executive officer. Formed in 1992 from the merger of German retail grocery chains divi, Basar, Continent, Esbella and real-kauf, Real was at its height one of the larger players in the landscape.

Müller-Sarmiento led the company through a number of major transformations, including the redesign of the brick-and-mortar store outlets, the establishment of digital platforms, a revamp of the internal operations, and most notably, a number of divestitures and carve-outs topped off by the February 2020 sale to a consortium consisting of property investors X+Bricks and the SCP Group.

The sale of the brand, the 276 Real stores and transfer of approximately 34,000 Real employees in Germany saw Müller-Sarmiento’s mandate come to a natural close, and he has now taken the opportunity to handover his responsibilities and re-join the firm he previously spent a decade with. He latterly was a senior partner and Head of the firm’s Consumer Goods & Retail practice, and now reassumes this role per January 1st.

We are delighted to be able to welcome him back into the family,” said Global Managing Partner Stefan Schaible.

With a seat on the Innovation Board, Müller-Sarmiento will also help the global consulting firm progress its business portfolio. This will include innovative strategies and services that support companies in the process of digitalising their business models while also taking the necessary steps towards a sustainable economy.

A report by the BFC’s Institute of Positive Fashion, delivery firm DHL and consultancy Roland Berger found UK clothing returns generated 750,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2022, when some 23 million garments were disposed of: around 75% of total returns.

The research found incorrect sizes and poor quality were the main reason for returns, but said large retailers could reduce return handling costs by 20-40% with the introduction of sizing calculators and avatars.

“This project recognises the importance of investing in innovation to secure robust and profitable businesses, while safeguarding the planet and society,” said BFC chief executive Caroline Rush.

“The responsibility now lies with retailers and fashion businesses to reach the target state by implementing the necessary change across their entire businesses, from production to reverse logistics.”

Customers were unmoved by environmental messages to prevent returns, but 56% of 1,503 online shoppers surveyed indicated a return fee was the most likely measure to prevent them sending goods back. It predicted free returns would disappear as firms used these charges to try to meet climate goals.

The report also said retailers should invest in better technologies and processes to make returns operations more efficient, cost-effective and less carbon intensive.

Siobhan Gehin, senior partner at Roland Berger, said lower consumption and higher operating costs were motivating companies to switch to circular business models.

“While the future for fashion is circular, achieving it is not an easy task,"" she said. ""The prize, though, is that circular fashion businesses are estimated to grow 18% a year from where they were at the beginning of this decade to 2030, whereas the rest of the market is looking at just 3% annual growth.”",['Mark Smulian'],2023-03-17 09:39:33+00:00

Sascha Haghani, a senior partner at the firm and head of Roland Berger’s Restructuring & Corporate Finance: “We have helped many of the world’s top companies and financial investors understand the true essence of value creation and make smarter decisions in investor support and M&A.”

With over 2,400 employees, Roland Berger is one of globe’s larger consulting firms, and Europe’s largest home grown consultancy that is positioned in the top of the strategy & operations segment of the consulting industry. The firm’s Corporate Finance arm helps clients – companies, private equity firms, family offices and entrepreneurs – with a range of M&A-related services.

These include valuations (assessment of target value), commercial due diligence (analysis of market drivers and trends, competitors, customer landscape, as well as a target's top line business plan), IPO review (crafting an independent market research report as part of submission for an Initial Public Offering), and operational due diligence (assessment of key operational and CAPEX assumptions, benchmarking of KPIs and working capital analysis).

Following deal closing, Roland Berger’s M&A team support clients with post-merger integration, such as integration planning (management, business, cultural), setting up 100 day plans (a roadmap for the first 100 days following closing) and broader project management on the integration across divisions, functions and processes. The firm’s consultants also help management of buyer/seller with value optimisation in deal settings, providing propositions including business planning, cost improvement and commercial improvement.

Specifically for private equity firms, which are booming on the back cheap capital and investment confidence, Roland Berger helps investors with target search (analysis of customers and growth markets), dealmaking, integration (integration blueprints) and strategic work such as fund strategy and portfolio optimisation.



“We offer comprehensive commercial advice across the entire investment cycle, from the holding period to the end of the road, to both buying and divesting companies. And once an acquisition has been completed, our expert consultants help clients increase the value of their asset with a 100-day programme and post-merger integration,” explained Haghani.

Over 1,000 deals supported

Data released by Roland Berger reveals that its Corporate Finance arm has seen busy times in the past three years, having been tapped by over 1,000 clients for its services in the period. The firm’s consultants were most active in Industrial & Technology segment, at over 230 deals, with the number of transactions supported in the Consumer Goods & Retail, Automotive, and Pharma & Healthcare above the 100 mark.

From a country perspective, the consultancy was most active in the DACH region – Germany, Austria and Switzerland. This is not a major surprise, as the Germany headquartered consulting firm has a strong presence in the region with six offices in Germany and one each in Vienna and Zurich, while its Corporate Finance wing is led from the region as well. France is the second most important country for Roland Berger – the consultancy has a large office in Paris, and increasingly benefits from the fact that its Chief Executive Office is a Frenchman, Charles-Edouard Bouée, currently in his second term at the office. The Benelux follows in third place, with the Amsterdam office, which has around 100 consultants, the largest regional contributor to the total with 90+ deals.



The data shows that Roland Berger’s corporate finance footprint spans the globe – among the countries where deals have been supported are Russia, India, Brazil, China, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.

Commenting on what he believes makes the practice stand out from its rivals, Haghani said, “Making the right investment decisions requires a trusted partner – someone with profound industrial and methodological know-how, someone who identifies the true value of a target by providing holistic commercial and operational due diligence support. The right partner doesn’t simply tell you what you want to hear, but rather what you really need to know about the industry's success factors and the target's business model.”

Last month, Roland Berger was named in a global assessment of peers as one of the top consulting firms for M&A and transaction support.

Consultant Emir Cabukoglu spoke to Consultancy.org about his experiences as part of Roland Berger’s Middle East team since joining two years ago.

The consulting industry has long been one of the most popular among graduates looking to jump-start their careers, with challenging work, compelling projects, a diversity of industries and clients all regularly cited as reasons the world’s best and brightest head into professional services, post-university.

In particular, many graduates are drawn to the strategy segment of the consulting sector. According to Emir Cabukoglu, a Consultant with Roland Berger, life at the firm has already more than justified his choice of joining the industry over spending more time in academia.

Originally from Turkey, Cabukoglu attended Austrian and German schools in Istanbul before moving to Switzerland, where he eventually picked up Bachelor's and Master’s degrees in Mechanical Engineering from ETH Zürich. At that point, Cabukoglu found himself at a crossroads – unsure whether to embark on a further specialisation with a PhD, or to broaden his horizons with a new challenge.

He explained, “I really wanted to do something else, and I eventually settled on entering the consulting world for a couple of reasons. First, I had the desire to expand my knowledge in multiple areas, not stick to one point where my interests might be at that moment in time. When you do a PhD you focus on a single detail of a very technical area – but I wanted to learn about new things.”

“Further, some of my friends had already gained experience in management consulting, and exchanges with them inspired me in getting into the sector.”

The choice of where to do that was a complex one, though. After spending so much time in Turkey and Switzerland, Cabukoglu found the idea of another fresh start particularly alluring. After looking at different countries, finally he ended up in Dubai. Drawn by the city’s expat culture, as he generally likes “cosmopolitan places where it is easy to interact with people, or get into a new culture,” he commenced a new life with Roland Berger’s office in the United Arab Emirates.

Commenting on what specifically drew him to strategy work with Roland Berger, Cabukoglu noted, “Strategic consulting is particularly interesting to me because it is high-level – it gives you a big opportunity to make a major impact… For example, when you help execute a project for a public entity in the region, your impact can directly become a national impact – improving the lives of many people. At the same time, when working for a private entity, you work with executives to plan for the future of a firm, and so on that basis you also impact a lot of people.”

Having been with the consultancy for almost two years now, Cabukoglu has seen a great deal of high-level work in this regard. At the beginning of their time, new members of the firm can acquaint themselves with multiple areas of service, but as Cabukoglu’s primary interest is in energy, his major engagements have mostly fallen in this field. His first project was with a public entity in the region, preparing a workforce development strategy for the energy sector – something which would lead to job creation for hundreds of thousands of people.

Demonstrating the diversity of the work offered in strategy consulting, the next engagement straight after that involved a private sector client. The billion-dollar company wanted to acquire two of its regional rivals in the industry, but it needed support with the acquisition, including due diligence work and the planning of merger phases following the purchase.

Another engagement was a with a large investment company, which was exploring a new energy segment and needed support to develop concrete investment opportunities. “It was a move which would allow the company to enter an entirely new segment of energy to become a global player, and that would have an impact on billions of dollars in investment.”

Global connections

Reflecting on what have been so far the most rewarding aspects of his time with Roland Berger, Cabukoglu said, “The impact that the work has on the client’s side, and in the country the clients are based, is the most exciting part of work – and the most rewarding.”

“At the same time, it’s a really enriching atmosphere, as all these projects involve the international cooperation of multiple offices. When all these experts come together and deploy their knowledge for the client, this triggers an amazing learning experience for young professionals.”

“When the office doesn’t have the knowledge locally, it flies in talent to share knowledge. For example, in my first project, the project saw the French, German and Middle Eastern offices collaborate.”

Since the global financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath, the consulting industry of the GCC states – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates – had only trended upwards. Along with the rest of the global economy, however, the GCC consulting market faced a rude awakening in 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic and its associated recession led the sector’s combined fees to drop.

According to Cabukoglu, however, while the firm faced challenges, Roland Berger’s core cultural attributes have prepared it well for these difficult times. In particular, the firm’s willingness to let staff choose their own path means there is a real drive to achieve top results, while its diversity allows the company to cater to the complex needs of clients across the GCC.

He concluded, “It’s not always the case that you get the chance to work where your interest lies, but there is an understanding here that you will do best, and go the extra mile, where your areas of passion are. Because of the dynamics and realities of the region, our international collaborations have been a huge plus for us. You don’t see a dominant culture here, so as well as complementing each other, we can learn from each other, and better meet the demands of different clients all over the region.”",[],2021-07-12 11:14:00+00:00

Electromobility, autonomous driving and digital transformation of cars: Technological change continues to put pressure on margins of automotive suppliers. The Covid-19 pandemic has further intensified this trend. As a result, this year’s global sales are expected to slump by an average of 15 to 20 percent compared to 2019. Suppliers’ average EBIT margin fell to 1.7 percent in the first half of 2020. The pandemic’s effect on automotive suppliers is revealed in the “Global Automotive Supplier Study 2020” from Roland Berger and Lazard. The study analyzes performance indicators of approximately 600 suppliers around the globeto assess the current state of the industry, as well as trends and challenges.

“Despite difficult underlying data, a brighter year-end is emerging. Automotive suppliers are able to stabilize financially, mainly thanks to the rapid recovery process in China,” says Felix Mogge, Partner at Roland Berger. “However, many suppliers lack the capital for the necessary technological transformation following the slump.”

Poor key figures affect creditworthiness

Overall, the coronavirus shock will affect the automotive industry for a long time to come. The peak volume of global vehicle sales that was reached in 2017 (94.3 million) is not expected to be met again until 2026. In Europe and North America, it will take even longer while China and South America will recover more quickly, according to the report.

Together with poor key financial indicators, these forecasts may have a negative impact on the creditworthiness of automotive suppliers. “In 2019 we already observed banks becoming more restrictive in their credit financing,” says Christof Söndermann, Managing Director at Lazard. “In recent months, many suppliers were confronted with rating downgrades. This increased financial pressure further.”

Lessons from the post financial crisis era 2008/09

The current situation can be compared to the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. In the period that followed, some automotive suppliers benefited more than the average. “We identified four general characteristics that were crucial to success after the financial crisis,” says Felix Mogge. “Suppliers can use these to orient themselves and gain a better position in the market based on clear strategic guidelines.”

One characteristic that will distinguish the winners from the losers of the coronavirus crisis in coming years is consistent market and technology leadership in every business area. Another is strategic coherence, which includes having a coherent product portfolio that allows for the realization of synergies. The third characteristic is the achievement of a critical company size to ensure sufficient access to the capital markets. Finally, winners will demonstrate consistent implementation of their strategic decisions and a performance-driven corporate culture.

Balancing act between restructuring and strategic realignment

Technological change and the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic will continue to impact the margin performance of automotive suppliers for the foreseeable future. “The challenges of the coming years will structurally overwhelm many suppliers,” predicts Felix Mogge. “As a consequence, we will see greater consolidation in the industry.” In order to be among the winners in this environment, automotive suppliers must strategically develop their business and at the same time significantly reduce costs.

“An automotive supplier’s CEO and management team have to walk a fine line: On the one hand, they have to consistently restructure or exit their commodity activities, while on the other hand, they must take risks with intelligent capital spending to develop new areas for future profitable growth,” says Christof Söndermann. “We therefore expect to increasingly see strategic cooperations in order to achieve relevant scale or to get access to new technology more quickly.”

Deckers joined Roland Berger’s Brussels office as a Senior Partner and member of the Belgian management team on October 1st, 2019. He brings over two decades of experience to the German-origin strategy and management firm, of which nineteen years have been in management consulting.

Most recently, Deckers was Managing Director of Accenture Strategy in Belgium and Luxembourg, a role he held for nearly four years. Previously, he led the CFO & Enterprise Value practice of Accenture in the Benelux, spanning Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

He joined Accenture in 2012 with twelve years of KPMG experience under his belt. At the Big Four firm, Deckers was a Partner in the firm’s Consumer Markets industry group, leading client delivery to among others retailers, fashion and apparel brands, fast moving consumer goods companies, e-commerce players and home improvement stores.

https://www.consultancy.eu/news/2186/roland-berger-expands-partner-team-in-amsterdam-the-netherlands,"Roland Berger expands partner team in Amsterdam, the Netherlands","Seyger’s gap in Amsterdam will to an extent be filled in by protégé Casper Veenman, who has worked closely with the senior partner on engagements in the automotive, transportation and mobility segments. Veenman has been with Roland Berger since 2008, when he joined the strategy consultancy from Accenture, where he started his career as a consultant six years previous. Having joined as a Consultant, Veenman has since ascended the ranks to Senior Consultant, Project Manager, Principal and as per 1 January 2019, Partner.

At Roland Berger, Veenman supports companies with strategy (market analysis and sector development), operational improvement, innovative management and sustainability services. Veenman also works for decision-makers in the public domain – a recent study which he co-authored for instance found that the growing uptake of electrical vehicles is a costly development for the Dutch government. According to calculations by Veenman and his colleagues, the government may see its coffers miss out on up to €600 million per year by 2021, for a large part due to the fact that drivers of electrical cars and vans are exempted from paying fuel taxes.

Summarising his main competencies, Roland Berger describes Veenman as a consultant that “tackles his client's issues head on, working with them to find practical, innovative solutions that can be put into practice immediately.” Veenman studied Business Information Systems at the University of Amsterdam, and followed the leadership development programme at Harvard Business School.

Joining Veenman as a newly appointed Partner is Erwin Douma, who started his career at Roland Berger in 2003, after obtaining a Masters in Chemical Engineering at Delft University of Technology. He has since worked twelve years for the consulting firm, with a 3-year stint at Philips as Director of Innovation Excellence the only period he spent externally. Douma supports companies with business model innovation and performance improvement and operations, with a focus on clients in the chemical and manufacturing industries. He also advises clients on matters such as strategy development, product management, organisation redesign, programme management, strategic sourcing and change management.

“Thanks to his experience in the consumer division at Philips, Erwin is a strategy consultant with a pragmatic eye, while enjoying being intensively involved in strategy execution,” states Roland Berger on its website.

Nine partners in the Netherlands

The appointment of Veenman and Douma takes Roland Berger’s partner team in the Netherlands to nine, including other leaders Tijo Collot d'Escury, Mark de Jonge, Arnoud van der Slot, Benno van Dongen, Alexander Belderok, David Frans, and David van der Does. They lead a team of around 110 consultants and staff, who combined generate over €30 million in revenues, up from €20 million six years ago.

https://www.consultancy-me.com/news/3945/roland-berger-signals-mixed-progress-across-regions-mobility-landscape,Roland Berger signals mixed progress across region’s mobility landscape,"Autonomous vehicles are set to take hold of the Middle East mobility market, although electrification in the region lags far behind global figures. This is according to new Roland Berger analysis.

Roland Berger’s biannual Automotive Disruption Radar draws on a range of historical and current data sources to understand the mobility landscape in 18 countries across 26 indicators – spanning key themes of customer interest, regulation, technology, infrastructure and industry activity.

The good news at a global level is that Covid-19 and its economic repercussions have left the automotive sector undeterred. “The automotive industry continues to focus on innovation even though the economic environment remains tense in the pandemic,” explained Rene Seyger, managing partner at Roland Berger Middle East.

“The four big trends – new mobility, autonomous driving, digitalisation and electrification – continue to shape the market,” he added. Representing the Middle East in the study are key markets UAE and Saudi Arabia, where some indicators are visibly more promising than others.

Electrification, for instance, has hit its stride across Europe – where most countries are phasing out internal combustion engines within the next decade or so. And beyond, nearly half of all cities in focus have introduced some kind of restriction on internal combustion engines – none of which are in the Middle East.

This reflects in sales. “In the Middle East, electric vehicle sales still remain low with only 1% of total new car sales being electric in the UAE and close to none in KSA,” noted Arvind CJ, automotive expert and principal at Roland Berger Middle East.

“This is mainly due to the absence of strong policies to push xEVs. Once national policies are announced, the consumer adoption and infrastructure development are expected to pick up quickly,” he added. And there is plenty of incentive to push this policy along: another report from earlier this year revealed that unlocking the potential of sustainable mobility could bring $400 billion in economic value to the Middle East.

One area where the region is thriving is autonomous vehicle technology – helped along by wider digital advances in the region. An example is the share of autonomous functions in wider driving technology patents, which has jumped from just over 1% in 2015 to nearly 5% this year.

“The amount of technological progress we have seen in autonomous driving is remarkable, as the steady rise in patents indicates,” explained Roland Berger Middle East automotive head Santiago Castillo, who also noted other favourable developments in enabling technology.

“In the Middle East, especially in the UAE and KSA, the commercialisation of 5G services has taken them a step closer to the launch of fully autonomous solutions.”

The UAE is now leading the charge for a full-fledged autonomous push – having already set up a regulatory framework in 2017, with plans to launch autonomous passenger transport by late 2021. Per the researchers, Dubai hopes to reach 25% self-driving penetration across its transportation landscape by 2030.

As of December 31, there were over 1,650 organisations, and the ecosystem has experienced a 13.8 per cent growth.

Crypto Oasis has added more than 200 new organisations in Q4 2022. These firms have brought in over 1,300 skilled professionals to the ecosystem, bringing the total number of individuals working in this industry to over 8,300. This 19 per cent growth in employment numbers can be attributed to the UAE being a force to reckon with in the global blockchain landscape.

A total of 78.2 per cent (approx. 6,500) of these individuals work in native blockchain organisations, i.e. those focused on blockchain and related decentralised technologies. Meanwhile, 21.8 per cent (approx. 1,800) work for non-native companies, i.e. those that offer blockchain-related services or products but do not have blockchain as their primary focus.

Ralf Glabischnig, Founder of Crypto Oasis, stated: “We’re thrilled to have identified these new organisations in our ecosystem that are contributing to a diverse community of stakeholders. The possibilities for Web3 technology are vast, from finance and supply chain management to gaming and social media.”

“However, as it’s a relatively new and emerging technology, its full potential hasn’t been reached yet and the industry is facing challenges such as scalability, security, and user adoption. It’s an exciting and rapidly evolving field to watch and we’re eager to collaborate and learn from each other as we work to improve Web3 and decentralised technologies.”

Crypto Oasis supports blockchain and Web3 organisations to access resources and expertise that can help them navigate the complex and rapidly evolving landscape. In addition, joining the ecosystem allows them to network with potential partners and customers and showcase their work to a wider audience.

“The UAE is the perfect amalgamation of Talent and Capital built on a world-class infrastructure,” said Saqr Ereiqat, co-founder of Crypto Oasis.

“The Ministry of Economy (MoE) has become one of the first government entities in the world to be active in the metaverse. In 2022 the MoE published its Digital Economy Strategy, which aims to double the contribution of the digital economy from 9.7 per cent to 19.4 per cent in the next decade.

The inception of regulators like VARA and various industry events like the Abu Dhabi Finance Week and Dubai Fintech Week, as well as the launch of the Dubai Economic Agenda ‘D33’, demonstrate UAE’s commitment in taking an active step to becoming the centre of digital economy globally.“

To meet growing demand, Roland Berger has bolstered its Restructuring capabilities in DACH with three senior advisors.

Jan Maser joins Roland Berger from the business advisory arm of Helbling, a professional services group with offices in Germany and Switzerland, where he most recently was a member of the executive board and head of the firm’s Automotive practice. Before that, he was a senior manager at Big Four firm PwC.

Appointed a partner, Maser works from Roland Berger’s Dusseldorf office and focuses on restructuring projects, with a focus on the automotive and industrial sectors.

In Munich, Markus Held has been named a principal. He most recently was a Managing Director and Head of Distressed M&A at One Square Advisors, a corporate finance boutique that specialises in financial restructuring. He has gained extensive experience advising mainly mid-sized companies on debt advisory, turnaround and distressed dealmaking.

Commenting on his move, Held said: “Roland Berger is one of the leading advisors in restructuring and I am proud to be part of the team and to be able to support its further development with my expertise in capital structure challenges, recapitalisations – both in and out of court, and distressed M&A.”

Meanwhile, in Switzerland, Roland Berger has added Stephan Hartmann to its partnership in Zurich. He joins from Deloitte, where he was a Director in its CFO Advisory practice and was co-head of the Finance & Performance practice. At the Big Four firm, Hartmann supported clients with financing strategies, cost management, digital transformation, as well as turnaround and restructuring services.

Earlier in his career, he worked for Detecon and BearingPoint. He also spent several years in industry, serving among others OC Oerlikon, a supplier of engineering materials, and a company in the life sciences sector.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/insead/2012/07/06/roland-berger-rating-europe/,Roland Berger: Rating Europe,"--- by Peter Dollé ---

The founder of one of the world’s top consultancies reflects on German unification, the European economy and the need for a European rating agency.

Roland Berger (INSEAD MBA ’64) can call this his baby, although he’s quick to point out that his consultancy merely inspired the creation of the European Rating Agency. After a year of hard work, he and his staff at Roland Berger Strategy Consultants succeeded in rallying financial support for their idea of “a global rating agency of European origin”.

“As an intellectual contribution to the debate of this ratings situation worldwide and of the oligopoly or the monopoly of the three American rating agencies, there was the political debate whether the competition in the rating agency market shouldn’t be more intense,” Berger told INSEAD Knowledge in Berlin recently. “And we agreed to this, first of all.” The agency will have the legal form of an independent foundation.

Selling the idea to European investors may have received tacit support from U.S. agencies themselves: Over the past four months, Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch have downgraded nearly a dozen Eurozone countries despite the introduction of bigger EU/IMF rescue packages, guarantees and austerity measures. The U.S. agencies are painted as ruinous in the national press of many EU countries.

Berger and most EU leaders are critical of the credit rating model practised by the U.S. agencies. The new European approach says Berger, “avoids the necessary conflict of interest – if you rate a product and are paid by the manufacturer.” He adds, “Our proposal is a different business model where the customer pays the ratings because he has an interest in an objective judgment. So I think the model is good. It has a future.”

Euro crisis continues to divide Europe

Berger is a born-tactician and has spent the last half-century guiding top executives and government leaders through numerous recessions and the global transition to the information age. He has heard the inside stories – the deal making, the hefty promises to shareholders and constituents. Former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder is his personal friend. (Editor’s note: press reports say the Spanish government has hired Roland Berger Strategy Consultants and the U.S. strategists Oliver Wyman to conduct independent stress tests of the country’s banking system. Berger Strategy Consultants did not deny the report.)

Berger also senses the fear, frustration and helplessness now plaguing European businesses. He’s also concerned about the direction of the EU. He believes closer German-French relations are crucial for European integration and would like to see consistency in economic policy. “I think it would be a mess if the new French president would question all the agreements which were found until now among all the euro member states and among the new member states,” he says. “So I hope that the new French president will stick to the commitments - particularly the commitments for the Fiscal Compact…”

The Fiscal Compact was signed by most EU members in March 2012 and requires signatories to adopt a balanced budget law. Countries in violation of the Fiscal Compact would face fines; and only countries that adopt such a law can seek rescue funds from the European Stability Mechanism. The goal is closer fiscal union.

But a growing number of EU leaders – including the new French Socialist president, Francois Hollande – now want more economic stimulus and less austerity. In essence, they want a softer Fiscal Compact than the agreement promoted by the Conservative German chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy.

Economic growth in the 27 nation EU is forecast to shrink to zero this year, and contract slightly in the 17 member Eurozone, according to Eurostat. Berger is honest about the bleak outlook: “I think we have to accept slower growth in Europe for the next five to seven years,” says Berger. “It will be a bumpy road, also due to the sovereign debt crisis - due to the uncertainties around the euro.” On the upside, however, Berger believes Europe will emerge from the crisis stronger and more united politically.

The euro crisis has been a poison pill for the EU. It has divided the continent and created an air of uncertainty. Small and medium-sized businesses find it difficult to secure credit - a negative development that makes them less competitive globally. Despite this, Berger gives German managers high marks: “I think German managers are very international. They’re very innovative; they know how to deal with people issues, which is important nowadays. They’re very much customer-focused and service-focused. They are a pretty good mix between strategic thinking and operation competence, which is not the case in other countries.”

Global consulting from a German base

Berger founded Roland Berger Strategy Consultants in Munich 45 years ago and currently serves as honorary chairman. He is 74, quick witted, and youthful. He picks throughout the day from a large plate of sliced fruit on his desk.

Roland Berger Strategy Consultants focuses on restructuring, marketing and strategy, and also prepares independent economic reports on specific countries and industries. It is the world’s 5th largest consultancy, with 47 offices in 35 countries, 2,500 workers and 200 partners. Berger credits his success to hard work, good analysis and “crazy, innovative ideas”, as he describes them. In analysing his global operation, he says: “I’ve shown as an entrepreneur to be capable not only to invent things but to implement things and to make things happen. This, of course, has created over time trust with our clients - vis-à-vis Roland Berger Strategy Consultants, myself and my partners - and this has helped to develop the firm to the status where we are now.”

Berger does not believe the financial crisis has affected his business much. “The business model is still to create value for our clients and to get paid by time fee or project fee basis and not on success fee basis because I think success fee basis is against the objectivity which is required for a consultant.”

Berger’s office in Berlin is lined with photos of the opening of the Wall and German unification – two events which have accelerated European integration. Asked whether German unification has lived up to its promises, Berger said: “I would say politically yes, because it has brought freedom, democracy, free-market economy not only to the ex-GDR but also to the rest of the ex-Soviet empire – Poland, Romania and other countries. …On the other hand, there are still some bumpy roads to go to achieve the same level of wealth and economic well-being in the eastern part of Germany and more so in the ex-members of the COMECON. But we have seen during the last crisis that Poland is doing quite well. So I think altogether it was a very, very positive event.”

https://newsletter.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2021/04/21/4-students-win-case-for-a-cause-competition/,4 Students Win Case for a Cause Competition,"Four Wesleyan sophomores won consulting company Roland Berger’s annual Case for a Cause competition on Friday, April 9.

The competition, which raises money for the Make-A-Wish-Foundation, gives students a space to apply their practical skills and simulate strategy consulting work.

Asa Sakornpant ’23, Natchanok (Pim) Wandee ’23, Sarah Rizky Ardhani ’23, and Ransho Ueno ’23 belong to the Consulting Pathways Club and are all pursuing the data analysis minor through Wesleyan’s Quantitative Analysis Center.

Sakornpant, Ardhani, and Ueno are Freeman Asian Scholars and were sponsored by the Gordon Career Center to take part in the competition.

Wesleyan last won in 2018, when its team tied for first place, and made it to the finals in both 2019 and 2020. Though the competition looked different this year because of the virtual environment, Wesleyan once again took home first place. The team members’ prize is a guaranteed first-round interview with Roland Berger, which has 52 offices in 35 countries.

“At some point in my freshman year, I got interested in business consulting as my future career, and I was close to Sarah, and so we decided to do this competition,” Ueno told Associate Director of the Quantitative Analysis Center Professor Pavel Oleinikov in a recent interview with the winners. “And I’ve really benefited a lot from my teammates because I have never done [a] Case competition before, so I did not know how to approach it. But, I really liked QAC classes, since freshman year, and the skills that I might be able to gain from QAC classes—I was able to apply them in the competition.”

The students agree that being able to work well together greatly contributed to their success in the competition.

“I think finding a good team is really important, not just in terms of whether it’s flat or hierarchical, but as in, ‘be with the people that you like to spend time with,’” Sakornpant said. “I think that’s the most important, even before looking into what each person’s expertise is. . . . The way we approached it was, we like switching around what each one does because we are holistic. But I don’t think it is because of our expertise, but rather because we chose a team in which we knew we could communicate together.”

The team spent a lot of time prepping for the competition, including staying up late many nights. Each member emphasized that they got a lot out of the competition experience.

“I came into Wesleyan not really knowing what I wanted to do, but then I got acquainted with a lot of people who are trying to go into consulting or the finance industry, and I think these are two main areas that I will be looking into in the future,” Ardhani said. “And joining the Case competition made me think that consulting is actually pretty fun. We had to stay up pretty late at night, but we were trying to solve problems as a team. I am still pretty open about my future, but the Case competition made me realize that this is pretty cool.”

For Wandee, the competition was about more than just walking away with a prize.

“I wasn’t going into the competition to win,” Wandee said. “It was more like, ‘Okay, we want to do our best and give it all.’ And it doesn’t even matter what other people do because we did not get to see our competitors present at all. So it was just us and the judges and our main focus was ‘just do our best.’”",[],2021-04-21 00:00:00

Can enable sustainable connectivity by reducing 17mil tonnes in carbon



edotco Group, an integrated telecommunications infrastructure services company and consultant firm Roland Berger has jointly concluded that mobile network pperators (MNOs) could save up to US$10 billion (RM43.9 billion) through infrastructure sharing.

Entitled, ‘Towering Above: Building Tomorrow’s Digital Infrastructure in Asia,' the study suggested that MNOs can cumulatively save up to US$67 billion (RM249 billion) for consumers due to affordable 5G connectivity by 2025.

The study also showed that TowerCos can enable sustainable digital connectivity by reducing up to 17 million metric tonnes in carbon footprint by 2025.

According to edotco, the report explores the critical roles and potential impact of TowerCos across nine key Asian markets – Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Philippines, Myanmar, Cambodia and Sri Lanka.

It also demonstrates how TowerCos are stimulating sustainable digital connectivity to realise incremental socio-economic benefits for industries, societies and governments.

According to the report, digital infrastructure is becoming a critical digital economy enabler, with 5G expected to transform the industry.

As a result, TowerCos are now transforming their roles to become digital infrastructure providers, in addition to working closely with industry stakeholders to undertake deeper forms of active infrastructure sharing, the study indicated.

Gayan Koralage, director of group strategy at edotco Group, said while MNOs are rapidly expanding their network in low average revenue per user (ARPU) markets such as Asia, they face a significant challenge in keeping their cost per gigabyte under control while striving to meet the industry demands and adhering to regulators’ intended policy and regulatory outcomes.

“These can only be addressed sustainably through a higher degree of infrastructure sharing,” he said.

The report also noted that despite Southeast Asia (SEA) and South Asia being among the fastest growing sub-regions in terms of average data usage per user, MNOs have not been able to capitalise on the traffic trend.

This is causing the continuous decline in ARPU, making it challenging for MNOs to generate returns that commensurate with their cost of capital, it said.

“In overcoming the MNOs’ investment conundrums, solutions based on software-defined networking and a stronger partnership with next-generation TowerCos can foster greater scalability, speed and cost advantages.

“Such partnerships are rapidly unfolding in developed markets, showcasing the TowerCos’ emerging catalytic roles in business, society and the environment,” he said.

The study further noted that leading TowerCos are poised to assist MNOs by moving up the value chain by offering innovative 5G-enabled solutions such as open RAN, network- as-a-service solutions and edge computing to help MNOs achieve greater cost- and network- efficiency.

“Given today’s telecommunications industry dynamics, TowerCos must evolve to become active digital infrastructure providers to provide the needed industry scalability, efficiency and flexibility,” said Damien Dujacquier, managing partner of SEA, Roland Berger.

“However, the right regulatory environment is needed with five policy reforms critical to power growth: strong digital infrastructure mandate, conducive licensing and ownership regime, active promotion of infra sharing, streamlined process and enablement of adjacent services.,” he added.","['Digital News Asia', 'June']",2022-06-09 08:52:36+08:00

Global management consulting firm Roland Berger will team up with networking organisation Start-Up Nation Central on a series of strategic initiatives aimed at promoting business ties between the Israeli tech sector and governments and private sector companies in the GCC. According to a recently signed agreement, the two parties will also carry out joint research and analysis, marketing, and promotional activities.

“At Roland Berger, we are deeply committed to entrepreneurship, which is one of our firm’s fundamental values,” said the German-origin firm’s global managing partner Stefan Schaible. “Therefore, we are excited to collaborate with Start-Up Nation Central, one of the most developed global start-up ecosystem facilitators.”

“As partners we will craft innovative and sustainable solutions for clients from the private and public sectors alike,” continued Schaible.

Founded as an independent not-for-profit organisation in 2013, the Tel Aviv-based Start-Up Nation Central serves as a platform to connect governments, businesses and NGOs from around the world with Israeli’s vibrant tech start-up community innovating in areas such digital health, agritech, cybersecurity and industrial internet of things. Last year, the Israeli tech sector raised over $25 billion, with its number of unicorns climbing above 50.

Now, Roland Berger and Start-Up Nation Central will collaborate to further drive innovation and cross-national cooperation in the Middle East, continuing steps already taken by the non-profit facilitator. A year ago, Start-Up Nation Central launched the UAE-IL Tech Zone, an exclusive platform aimed at fostering tech and investment collaborations between the nations, which is now evolving to become a GCC regional community.

The organisation also last year signed an agreement with the UAE Minister for Food and Water Security to establish a framework for addressing shared food and water security challenges. Under the terms of the agreement, Start-Up Nation Central will scout and map innovative Israeli solutions and the ministry will connect them with the relevant UAE companies and government initiatives that can benefit from the technologies.

“We aim to leverage the complementary characteristics of the UAE and Israeli tech industries to establish a robust Middle East innovation hub that will create an innovation powerhouse to address regional and global challenges,” said Jeremie Kletzkine, Start-Up Nation Central’s vice president of business development. “As the leading business strategy consulting firm in the GCC, Roland Berger is the best possible partner for this mission.”

The partners say that such collaboration follows on from and will help fulfil the promise of the Abraham Accords signed in 2020, which signalled the normalisation of relations and closer ties between Israel and the UAE and fellow gulf state Bahrain. Like Israel, the latter also has a thriving technology start-up scene, including through Bahrain FinTech Bay, of which Roland Berger became a founding partner upon the hub's launch in 2018.",[],2022-01-24 05:05:00+00:00
https://targetjobs.co.uk/careers-advice/business-consulting-and-management/how-i-got-hired-roland-berger,How I got hired at Roland Berger,"Political developments such as Brexit are always going to create uncertainty and strategic questions for clients.

1. Why consulting?

I thought it would be a good environment in which to gain a broad understanding of the world of business, and to develop skills that would be useful for general management. I also wanted work that I would find intellectually challenging, and a company where there was a big emphasis on training and development.

2. Did you do any other work before consulting?

I worked for a market research firm on both client-facing research projects and internal strategy projects. This experience allowed me to develop data handling skills, and gave me a better general understanding of how businesses and client relationships work.

3. What do you think made you stand out from the other candidates?

I think the combination of an arts degree, evidence of quantitative ability (via previous work and A levels) and the extracurricular activities I had taken on at university helped to demonstrate I had the rounded skill set needed for consulting.

4. What have your major career steps so far been?

Aside from promotions since joining as a graduate, a major career milestone for me was taking a year out to study an MBA at INSEAD, where I spent time on both the Singapore and France campuses. It was a brilliant opportunity to consolidate and formalise skills I had already developed, broaden my knowledge in areas I was especially interested in and to meet people from all over the world.

5. What is your current role?

I'm a senior consultant, which means I manage either smaller projects, or a work stream within a larger project. I'm usually responsible for steering the work of a team of more junior consultants.

6. What are your main responsibilities on a day-to-day basis?

Day-to-day tasks vary widely depending on the nature of the project and stage at which it is at. They could include developing hypotheses, planning or structuring a project approach or the storyline for a presentation, conducting analysis or research, or managing others doing the same, and discussing findings with clients.

7. Has anything surprised you about consulting work?

There's not as much travel as I thought there would be. A lot of projects can be done from the office rather than the client site, especially when the main focus of a project is on external market dynamics rather than a client's internal operations. I've also been surprised by how far common sense can take you!

8. How is your work/life balance?

As with any high-pressure services job it can be challenging to manage work/life balance, but with enough planning you can usually make time to balance the two. In my experience, there is generally very little face-time or micro-managing by senior members, meaning that as long as you get the work done, you have a lot of freedom over when you work.

9. What are the most exciting parts of working in this area?

The unpredictability – working in a big international firm means that exciting opportunities in the UK and abroad can come up at very short notice, and you often never know which client or project you'll be working on in a few months' time.

10. What aspect of your job do you find the most challenging?

This would also have to be the unpredictability! While it keeps life exciting and varied, last-minute client requests or trips abroad can make it difficult to plan ahead.

11. Tell us about a career highlight.

This would have to be advising a major corporate client through an entire strategy cycle. We started with a market entry strategy project, followed on by due diligence on a target company identified. We then advised the client on aspects of the post-merger integration. It was hugely satisfying being able to aid and input on major real-life strategic decision-making, and then seeing the consequences of those decisions. There were also some great people in the client team from whom I learned a lot.

12. And a career crisis?

I spent one project based in the UK but working Australian hours in order to be able to speak to people there. Going home for the night just as everyone else was arriving bright and chirpy with their morning coffee was pretty disorientating.

13. What exciting developments have you witnessed in consulting?

The ever-increasing quantity and availability of data creates the opportunity to conduct richer and more creative analysis. As a consultant that means you are able to make more informed and reliable recommendations. Political developments such as Brexit are also always going to create uncertainty and strategic questions for clients.

14. Is there anything you wish you'd focused on more at university, which would have helped you receive an offer from Roland Berger?

I wish I had started doing internships and work experience earlier. I think direct experience is the only way of really understanding what a certain career or job involves and whether it would suit you. Regardless of whether the internship is in the specific field you want to go into, just having some experience enables you to talk with much more conviction about what you do want to do and why.

15. What three pieces of career advice would you offer students entering consulting?

1. Showing the right attitude and a keenness to learn is more important than the skills and knowledge you have when starting out.

2. Ask for lots of feedback.

3. Consider what you want to learn and where you want to go as you are starting out in consulting. As in any career, you'll develop more quickly if you have a clear idea of this and are proactive about steering towards it.",[],

“Our aim at this bi-annual meeting of our 230 Partners was to reflect on the world of 2028 and the consulting market in particular. Thanks to this collective intelligence, we derived scenarios for the future and are developing solutions for our clients that will matter tomorrow. 2018 will be an exceptional year for Roland Berger. It was time to work on the forthcoming challenges for our industry, thus securing the future of our newly elected Partners,” said Bouée.

John Low

A two-decade consulting veteran and current leader of the firm’s Public Services Competence Center for South East Asia, Malaysia-based John Low has been promoted to Senior Partner after first gaining partnership in 2012. With a Bachelor of Engineering from the University of New South Wales and an MBA from Meinders School of Business, Low primarily focuses on manufacturing, digital, healthcare, hospitality and public services sectors.

Ke Chen

Vice President of Greater China and Head of its Consumer Goods & Retail Competence Center, new Senior Partner Ke Chen is a widely regarded public expert on China’s retail sector, with nearly 20 years of industry-related experience. Prior to joining Roland Berger in 2015, Chen was partner and co-lead of the Shanghai branch of Accenture-acquired management consultancy Kurt Salmon, before which he served for three years as a director with Accenture.

Raymond Wang

Also based in Shanghai, Raymond Wang leads the firm’s TMT (technology, media, and telecom) and digital solutions and transformation practice. Following a BA in Information Technology completed in 2000 (since earning an executive MBA from CEIBS as well), Wang went on to work as a consultant with Arthur Andersen and BearingPoint, spent nearly eight years as a Director at Accenture, and before joining Roland Berger in 2014 was for over two years a Project Leader with BCG in Shanghai.

Minoru Fukuda

Joining in 2007, Minoru Fukuda has been with Roland Berger’s Tokyo office for eleven and a half years, during which time he completed an MBA from the IESE Business School at the University of Navarra in Barcelona – having earlier completed a B.Com in Marketing. Fukuda currently leads Roland Berger’s Consumer Goods & Retail practice in Japan, with a focus on the lifestyle & fashion and food & beverage sectors.

In the face of the global coronavirus pandemic and heavy social restrictions instituted across the many parts of the world, global management consultancy Roland Berger has held the first ever purely virtual partners’ meeting in its fifty-year history – with Greater China managing partner Denis Depoux elected to the Board of Managing Directors alongside Marcus Berret and Stefan Schaible, the latter who takes on the role of spokesman and Global Managing Partner.

Previously the deputy CEO, Schaible has been holding down the fort together with a support team since the sudden departure of former CEO Charles-Edouard Bouée, who stepped down in the middle of last year roughly twelve months into his second four-year term – keen to pursue other opportunities. Previously an investor in Vietnam-based online luxury retailer Leflair among other businesses, Bouée has since founded Alpha Intelligence Capital in Shanghai.

Roland Berger meanwhile will forge ahead with its new trio at the helm. Having overseen Roland Berger’s Greater China business for the past two years, Depoux has a long history in the region – first kicking off his career in China with French energy giant EDF more than two and a half decades ago before switching to the consultancy realm. Focused on the energy and environmental sectors, he joined Roland Berger in Paris at the end of 2011.

Along with local managing director duties, Depoux oversees a wide variety of Roland Berger competence centers, including Energy & Chemicals, Public Services & Real Estate, Transportation, Logistics & Tourism, Engineered Products & High Tech, Operations and HR Leadership & Transformation. As to energy & utilities, he has provided expertise to clients in areas such as new products and services, risk management, and M&A among others.

In addition to its new-look Board of Managing Directors, the firm’s 250-odd partners also voted in an expanded Supervisory Board, consisting of Sascha Haghani, (Roland Berger’s CEO for Germany, Austria and Switzerland), Laurent Benarousse (Casablanca Managing Partner and Civil Economics practice leader in Paris), Robert Henske (US Managing Partner), René Seyger (Middle East managing partner), and Yvonne Ruf (a partner in the firm’s Düsseldorf Office).

The firm says the new leadership team represents and capitalises on the diversity of the consultancy across all established fields of expertise and regions. The virtual partners’ meeting also saw the introduction of a comprehensive consulting package to support clients impacted by the current global coronavirus pandemic, with the offering focused primarily on how to reactivate economic performance in a controlled manner following the crisis.

“The spread of the coronavirus is putting our societies and the global economy through an unprecedented test,” said Schaible. “The protection of the population is the first priority. That is why the worldwide ban on contact and the rescue measures for companies are absolutely the right move,”, stating fast and proactive support as top of the firm’s agenda. “However, the question of how we can boost economic output in a controlled manner is already an important one.”",[],2020-04-15 00:00:00+00:00

Onozuka holds a Masters in Media and Governance from Keio University – the oldest higher education institute in Japan (est. 1858).

With broad-ranging experience in new business development, growth strategies, corporate turnarounds, operational improvements, merger & acquisition strategies, and supply chain management among other areas, Onozuka serves Roland Berger’s client-base in the logistics, distribution, manufacturing, and finance sectors as well as numerous other industrial fields.

An MBA graduate from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, Lee has over twenty years of international management consulting, investment banking, and entrepreneurial management experience and with Roland Berger focuses on strategy, transformation and leadership, private equity and corporate finance.

Altogether, Roland Berger took the opportunity of its bi-annual partners meeting to elect 12 new partners and elevate six to senior partner status worldwide. However, coming somewhat as a surprise, considering his reelection to the post just last year, was the announcement from CEO Charles-Edouard Bouée that he would be stepping down, effectively immediately, to pursue other opportunities – including a fresh role with the WEF as a Global AI Council member.

Bouée, who last year invested in Vietnam-based online retailer Leflair and spends part of his time in Shanghai, said; “We have all witnessed how globalisation and digitalisation are turning the world on its head. These developments are also offering incredible opportunities that I’m thrilled to explore and seize. After 18 years in consultancy at Roland Berger and after having successfully led the company’s transformation as part of a strong team, I am ready to put this invaluable experience and expertise into entrepreneurial practice.”",[],2019-06-20 04:02:00+00:00

“I am very excited that Mark and Sjors are joining our team. Their arrival further enhances the competitiveness of our local Financial Services practice, and will also be of great value to our EMEA and global business,” said Véronique Pauwels, Managing Partner of Bain & Company in the Netherlands.

Together, the duo bring more than 30 years of experience in strategy consulting to Bain & Company – one of the world’s leaders in the segment (12,000 consultants and staff in ~40 countries). Both previously were a partner at Roland Berger in Amsterdam and long-time employees of the German-origin strategy consultancy.

Mark de Jonge was a senior partner at Roland Berger, and a leader in the Financial Services practice. He specialises in the banking and insurance segments, and supports clients with business model innovation, growth realisation, operating model performance improvement, and digitisation.

Earlier in his career, De Jong had brief stints at Quintel Strategy Consulting (acquired by Kearney in 2011) and Arthur D. Little (the world’s oldest management consultancy).

Sjors van der Zee started his career in strategy consulting at Roland Berger in 2006, and grew the ranks to become a partner (in 2017). He also specialises in the banking and insurance segments, with a focus on strategic transformations, operating model engineering, cost reductions and commercial due diligence.

The move sees Bain & Company welcome its fifth and sixth new partner to its leadership team in Amsterdam this year, following the previous appointments of Aleksander Lyngvi, Daniëlle Stekelenburg, Daan van Ginneken and Velu Sinha.",[],2021-11-22 05:01:00+00:00
https://www.consultancy.eu/news/7439/global-consulting-firms-respond-to-russias-invasion-of-ukraine,Global consulting firms respond to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,"Many of the world’s largest consultancies have now severed ties with Russia following the country’s invasion of Ukraine, while working to support their staff and others caught in the cross-hairs.

Accenture

Global tech consultancy Accenture has axed its entire workforce in Russia in response to what it describes as an unlawful and horrific attack on the people of Ukraine and their freedom, but will continue to provide support to its almost 2,300 workers in Russia.

While Accenture doesn’t have a Ukraine business, it will also provide support to its Ukrainian colleagues around the world and their extended families, through telehealth and resettlement services. The firm has also donated $5 million to non-profits aiding the tens of thousands of displaced, and will match all staff donations.

McKinsey & Company

McKinsey has said that it will cease its existing work with Russian state-owned entities and has stopped its work for the government. It will also refrain from taking on any new client work in Russia, and once its current engagements conclude it will suspend all client service in the country. Its Moscow office will however remain open to provide support to its 400-plus local colleagues.

The firm will also match donations from its staff at a rate of three to one, and is donating $2 million in cash and $10 million worth of pro bono aid to agencies supporting those impacted by the crisis.

Boston Consulting Group

BCG also employs about 400 people in Russia, and will suspend new work with Russian clients while honouring its current contractual obligations and keeping its Moscow office open. According to the Financial Times, a source familiar with the matter said that local staff would be offered the chance to relocate outside of Russia or will be able to work on internal projects for non-Russian clients.

The firm has also established a donation-matching program to charities supporting refugees, in particular the World Food Programme and Save the Children with which it has an existing relationship.

Bain & Company

While the consultancy itself appears not to have made an official statement in response to recent events, Bain & Company’s global managing partner Manny Maceda outlined on LinkedIn that the firm had already in 2020 decided not to take on further work from the Russian government at any level, be it central, state, or departmental, along with agreeing not to advise specific industries in the country such as the military and intelligence sectors.

Bain is still re-evaluating its work with other Russian clients, and is working around the clock to ensure the safety of its Kyiv-based staff.

Oliver Wyman

Oliver Wyman CEO Nick Studer has also spoken on behalf of the global management consultancy, making a commitment to its staff that the firm will not work with the Russian government’s state-owned organisations anywhere in the world. Studer also noted that the firm is providing financial support and expertise to the entrepreneurial initiatives of its staff in neighbouring countries who are aiding refugees, and in time would offer employment opportunities to those directly impacted.

Kearney

A native of Taiwan, Kearney global managing partner Alex Liu has acknowledged “the spectrum of passion and heartache related to issues of sovereignty”, and stated that the firm supports the sanctions imposed on Russia by governing bodies around the world and would not serve any Russian government entities.

Kearney is also currently reviewing all of its commitments and contracts with clients in Russia, and is doing what it can to support staff in both Ukraine and Russia.

Roland Berger

German-origin management consultancy Roland Berger, which in 2019 had to grapple with revelations of its eponymous founder’s father’s Nazi collaborations, has of the 1st of March ended all activity for Russian clients – stating that Europe was facing one of its darkest hours since the end of the Second World War and that the Russian president’s war cannot go on without business consequences.

Roland Berger is also supporting the relocation of its Ukrainian colleagues and their families.

DXC Technology

DXC Technology has taken a firm stand in condemning the Russian Government for its “unwarranted aggression” by committing to exit the Russian market entirely, where it has a headcount of almost 4,000. The tech consultancy will also match employee donations to humanitarian efforts twice over, including by providing direct financial support to its impacted colleagues and their families “regardless of their nationality or country of origin.”

FTI Consulting

A spokesperson from FTI Consulting, which doesn’t list a Russian office among its global locations but does conduct business in the country, told the Guardian that in addition to dumping sanctioned clients the firm was in the process of reviewing all of its ongoing connections with non-sanctioned entities and would withdraw from engagements where appropriate.

The spokesperson also stated FTI Consulting wouldn’t be taking on any new Russia-controlled clients for the time being.

PwC

Big Four professional services firm PwC is set to expel its Russian member, but will work with PwC Russia to undertake an orderly transition of the business out of concern for its 3,700 staff in the country. PwC Belarus will also exit the global network. Meanwhile, the firm is working to ensure the safety of its 750 employees spread across three offices in Ukraine, led by their colleagues in Central and Eastern Europe who have been providing support with transportation and housing.

KPMG

KPMG Russia and KPMG Belarus will all also be leaving the firm’s international network. KPMG said that the move was incredibly difficult considering its combined headcount of more than 4,500 people between the two nations – “many of whom have been a part of KPMG for many decades” – but that it believed it has a moral responsibility to act. “We will seek to do all we can to ensure we provide transitional support for former colleagues impacted by this decision,” the firm added.

Grant Thornton

Responding quickly, mid-tier global accounting and consulting network Grant Thornton had by the start of the month already booted out its Russian member FBK, which has 500 partners and staff and last year generated $22 million of the firm’s $6.6 billion in global revenues. Grant Thornton’s member firm in Ukraine is receiving support from other network members around the world.

Ernst & Young

EY has condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has decided to legally separate its Russian operation from its global body, and EY will not serve Russian government clients, state-owned enterprises or sanctioned entities and individuals anywhere in the world.

Deloitte

At the time of writing, Deloitte had suspended business operations and client service in Ukraine, switching its focus instead to taking care of employee safety, but was still reviewing its business and presence in Russia as of the 7th of March.

The firm stated that it doesn’t serve any Russian central government entities, and that it hoped that peace would prevail quickly. A number of Deloitte’s European practices have combined to donate over $2.5 million to various relief agencies.

In a new report, consultancy Roland Berger forecasts that one million of these specially designed vehicles, many of them electric, are set to be sold by 2020 in Europe, the United States and China alone. Demand will reach some 2.5 million by 2025, according to the report.





This new type of car unites two of the key mobility megatrends in one vehicle: ride-sharing and electromobility. What this new vehicle category does is put the passenger, not the driver, firmly center stage. And it is purpose built for use as a taxi service. —Jan-Philipp Hasenberg, Partner at Roland Berger

An attractive market segment for automotive OEMs is opening up here, given that the reduced complexity of these vehicles will allow them to be manufactured for about half the cost of a conventional car. Further, with electric models in their portfolio, automakers will be better able to meet applicable CO 2 targets.

Vehicle manufacturers should take active steps to get into this niche market now so that they can establish a strong competitive position and get their customers excited about the new models. —Jan-Philipp Hasenberg

Passengers, too, will benefit from the new mobility concept. These vehicles offer higher levels of convenience and are also cheaper to buy and maintain because they don’t require oil changes and the brakes don’t wear out so fast, for example.

We anticipate the price per kilometer for using these cars to come in at between 0.5 and 0.8 euros. These purpose-built vehicles will therefore be among the cheapest means of getting around in a car. The only thing that will be cheaper to use, at less than 0.3 euros per kilometer, will be genuine robocabs without a driver. —Wolfgang Bernhart, Partner at Roland Berger

There is also much potential in the market for ride-sharing services. Such players are experiencing remarkable growth worldwide as the demand for mobility services that don’t depend on personal car ownership continues to tick ever upward.",[],2018-06-20 00:00:00
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/22/truth-behind-german-businessmans-anti-nazi-father-revealed,Truth behind German businessman's 'anti-Nazi' father revealed,"It was an inspirational tale: after watching the horror of the Kristallnacht pogrom in 1938, a German man tore up his Nazi party membership card in protest and turned against the regime.

His Christian-based principles led to him being hounded by the Gestapo, sent off briefly to Dachau concentration camp and eventually dispatched to the eastern front.

In speeches, interviews and articles Germany’s most famous management consultant, Roland Berger, has cited the story of his father, Georg, as the inspiration that led the successful entrepreneur to set up a foundation and an annual €1m prize in 2008, dedicated to honouring “human dignity”.

“To this day, my father remains a moral role model for me,” he told Focus magazine in 2012. “He represents decency and courage.”

The only problem with this inspirational story was that it was not true. An investigation published by Handelsblatt has shown that Georg Berger was never the victim of the Nazis his son had painted him as, but a wartime profiteer.

Rather than joining the Nazi party for careerist reasons after Hitler had seized power in 1933, as Berger claimed in an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung as recently as last September, Berger senior signed up for the National Socialist cause as early as 1931, and kept on paying his membership fee until 1944.

Georg Berger’s Nazi party card from 1936 Photograph: Handelsblatt

Berger’s loyalty to the Nazi regime led Hitler to promote him to become a ministerial adviser in 1937, and later put in charge of Ankerbrot – Austria’s largest bakery and a crucial wartime state asset – after its Jewish owners fled the country.

When Georg Berger did run into conflict with the Nazi party, historical records suggest it was not because of his moral principles, but because he was accused of illegally hoarding groceries during wartime, and carrying out costly renovations at his Viennese villa, which had been confiscated from its Jewish owners.

No records of his supposed arrest or imprisonment at Dachau could be found, said Sönke Iwersen, who runs Handelsblatt’s investigations team.

Over the weekend, the Roland Berger foundation announced it would postpone its awards ceremony on Monday, after this year’s recipients, the Polish human rights activist Adam Bodnar and a German anti-racism initiative, announced they would decline their prize in the light of the revelations.



Berger, whose consultancy firm has 50 offices worldwide and announces itself on its website as “the only leading global consultancy firm with non-Anglo-Saxon roots”, is the latest in a series of large German business owners who have recently revealed their founders’ families entanglement in the structures of the Nazi regime.

In March, one of Germany’s richest families donated €9.7m of their fortune to charity after discovering their ancestor’s antisemitism, avowed devotion to Adolf Hitler and use of slave labour during the second world war.

The Reimann family, whose JAB Holding Company owns a controlling stake in brands including Krispy Kreme and Dr Pepper, had themselves commissioned the historian who found that female slaves from Nazi-occupied eastern Europe were beaten and sexually abused at Reimann premises in Ludwigshafen, in the Rhineland.

In May, the heiress of the Bahlsen biscuit empire apologised for comments downplaying the hardship faced by people forced to work at the family business under Nazi rule.

“This was before my time and we paid the forced labourers exactly as much as German workers and we treated them well,” 25-year-old Verena Bahlsen, one of four children of the company owner, Werner Bahlsen, had told Bild.

Historians say that the approximately 200 forced labourers at the Hanover-based Bahlsen works, many of them women from occupied Ukraine, had to work in a “racial hierarchy” in often miserable conditions.

Berger, 81, a central figure in Germany’s economic postwar history, who advised the former chancellor Helmut Kohl on the privatisation of East Germany’s state assets and Gerhard Schröder on his economic reforms, has not questioned the researchers’ findings. Instead, he announced that he has hired two respected historians, Michael Wolffsohn and Sönke Neitzel, to examine his family’s history.

His version of his father’s biography, he said in an interview with Handelsblatt, had been based on his father’s own memories and those of relatives and friends. Accepting their version of events, Berger conceded, amounted to “unintended self-deception”.

“I want to know the truth – and then change the image of my father,” he added.",['Philip Oltermann'],2019-10-22 00:00:00

As Roland Berger’s CEO states in the new issue of Manager Magazin, which will be available on December 19th, the consultancy and Rocket Internet plan a so-called “super incubator” named Terra Numerata.

Both companies will each hold 50 percent of the incubator, Roland Berger’s CEO Charles-Edouard Bouée told German Manager Magazin.

“Our company will work like a factory and will produce one company with a digital business model after another,” he explains.

That sounds pretty much like what Rocket Internet is doing right now. It’s not only unclear in how far the incubator will differ, nor when and where it will start.

The joint venture is part of Roland Berger’s new business strategy.

Update (December 23rd, 2014): This venture aims to become the core of a wide-ranging European digital business network that is open to incubators, investors, technology providers, and other digital players. The goal is to bring together firms of different sizes from different segments to help them form alliances and push digital innovation, e.g. by inventing new business models, and thus support the digitalization of the European business world.

“Looking at the world’s top 20 Internet companies by market capitalization, the need for such a platform becomes apparent: None of them are of European origin, while 13 of those companies come from the US and 7 from Asia”, says Bouée, adding “boosting Europe’s share in this market is the key mission of Terra Numerata™”.

We have reached out to Rocket Internet for a comment and will keep you updated.

Update (December 22nd, 2014): Rocket Internet explained that as of right now there are no more details to be shared.

Also: An older version of this article mentioned Bouée became a board member of Rocket Internet in September 2014. This information shared by InternetWorld was incorrect. Instead, it was Roland Berger who became board member. Also, Terra Numerata™ is the name of the Roland Berger’s digital business platform, not of the incubator.

https://techwireasia.com/amp/2019/05/roland-berger-leader-says-healthcare-needs-more-technology/,Roland Berger leader says healthcare needs more technology,"PEOPLE outside the healthcare industry tend to think that technology adoption is high among hospitals, device manufacturers, pharmacies, and so on. In reality, that’s far from the truth.

According to Forbes, although healthcare is reaching US$10 trillion globally, the industry lags behind nearly 80 percent of other industries in innovative technology adoption.

“This presents a white space opportunity for technological players in the healthcare sector, both incumbents and fast-rising startups, Roland Berger Indonesia Partner (Head of Life Sciences Southeast Asia) Yoshihiro Suwa told Tech Wire Asia.

Indonesia is at the heart of many interesting healthcare innovations in the Asia Pacific and possibly one of the most exciting testbeds of innovation in the region outside China.

It’s where telemedicine startups are collaborating with insurance companies and dominant superapp developers in the country.

The country is also home to artificial intelligence (AI) startups working with government agencies to make healthcare more accessible across its economic tiers.

Suwa, a witness to that innovation and an advisor to players in the industry believes that there is no shortage of digital technologies that can be applied for functions within the healthcare value chain.

“Among the red-hot digital technologies that are making a wave in the healthcare sector, a few such as telehealth, mHealth (mobile health), AI, virtual reality, and the blockchain are the strongest candidates in bringing about innovative disruption in the healthcare industry.”

However, Suwa adds that each of these technologies exist in different stages of maturity, which makes it difficult for players in the industry such as hospitals, pharmaceutical companies to evaluate each technology’s attractiveness on a standalone basis.

In fact, countless players globally are going through a gradual process of trial and error in their bid to identify and define the roles that these technologies will serve in the market.

No cookie-cutter approach for healthcare

“It is difficult to generalize about the entire healthcare industry. The players active in this industry constitute an incredibly wide-ranging group of companies, from manufacturers to service providers to insurers.”

Further, spotting opportunity in the market is complicated by the differences in health policy, regulations, and insurance regimes from one country to the next.

Thus, strictly speaking, opportunities for each suite of technology will vary by country and by player. Which means, healthcare companies need to evaluate each technology option against the goals and objectives of the business.

“Greenfield opportunities exist in many areas, but you should religiously evaluate the unmet needs in the area that your company is currently involved in. That should be the starting point when considering how and which digital technologies to best leverage.”

To put things into perspective, here’s an example: Singapore-based Raffles Medical Group recently began its digital transformation journey and focused on enhancing the quality of care and providing patients with a more connected experience.

“This allows doctors and healthcare professionals to achieve better health outcomes and ensures patients get seamless treatment,” Raffles Medical Group’s Commercial Director Jessica Tan told Tech Wire Asia recently.

Their choice of technology solutions reflected those goals and everything seamlessly fell into place as a result, despite the noise in the innovation ecosystem in the healthcare technology landscape.

Align technology with business goals

“Long-term inclinations of the healthcare technological pursuits fall roughly under three categories: better quality (improving quality of medical treatment), cost to zero (reducing costs of quality treatment so that any income level can receive it), and universal access (enabling all to receive quality treatment).”

Suwa believes that the megatrends of the healthcare industry are almost always in pursuit of these three objectives.

“Incumbents and startups alike should kickstart their digital health investment by aligning their business models and position along these three lines of healthcare objectives.”

According to Roland Berger’s management consultants, this frame of thinking facilitates business transformation that is guided on prioritization according to country, market players, field of medicine, and available technologies.

Using such an approach helps healthcare companies pinpoint the right technology solutions that help them on a more holistic level and accelerate their journey to digital maturity in a way that is most relevant to their business, most empowering for their staff, and most effective for their patients.

In conclusion, Suwa emphasizes that technology adoption in the healthcare space is lagging but that doesn’t mean everyone should just invest in any and every technology solution.

Given the various differences between companies in the healthcare space such as prevailing regulations, geography, and patient needs, players in the industry need to find technologies that best suit their goals and objectives.","['Soumik Roy', 'December', 'February', 'August']",2019-05-31 03:00:13+00:00

As a result, demand for consulting services in the field has steadily increased in recent years. The growing focus on cost efficiency programmes is further reinforcing this trend.”

Oliver Knapp, co-head of the Operations practice at Roland Berger, added; “Procurement departments are currently undergoing radical change and are facing growing pressures from new technologies and volatile markets. We expect strong demand, and have in recent years invested heavily in building a leading consultancy in the procurement and operations segments.”

Economy minister Claudiu Nasui made the announcement on Facebook. He said that the exploitation of graphite could turn Romania into an important country for the development of the battery industry.

""Romania can become a very important place for the battery industry and can get to this naturally, without subsidies or state aid schemes also paid from taxpayers' money,"" Nasui wrote in his Facebook post, according to Agerpres.

He added: ""Many modern technologies for the manufacture of batteries and solar panels use graphene, which is obtained from graphite, a product that we also want to manufacture in Romania.""

Romania has graphite deposits at the Baia de Fier mine in Gorj county.

https://www.greencarcongress.com/2019/12/20191204-emob.html,New fka and Roland Berger E-Mobility Index finds China best prepared for electric mobility among all automotive nations,"China continues to be the leading country for e-mobility in terms of industry and market, according to the E-Mobility Index 2019 from fka GmbH and Roland Berger GmbH. Although Germany takes the lead from France in terms of technology for this latest report, China is catching up quickly and ranks second in terms of technology for the first time.





The joint country comparison combines the three key areas of technology, industry and the market and enables an objective examination of the status quo in the field of electric mobility in China, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, South Korea and the USA.

China no longer shares the overall lead with the USA; rather it has now set itself apart, pushing the USA into second place. —E-Mobility Index 2019

Technology. German manufacturers (OEMs) are increasingly focusing on full battery-electric vehicles for the compact and small car segments, while full electrification of mid-size vehicles and partial electrification (plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, or PHEV) of SUVs continue to progress.

Due to lower vehicle weights, this results in an increase in range/battery capacity ratio and thus an improvement in terms of the vehicles compared.

Chinese vehicles are improving significantly and becoming safer and more efficient. Due to new Chinese laws and regulations, charging technologies that enable faster charging with direct current (DC) are increasingly being installed in Chinese vehicles. Chinese OEMs continue to focus on a portfolio of low-cost small and mid-range BEVs, according to the report.

Korea defends its third place in terms of technology. Korean OEMs are less focused on introducing new models, and more on improving technologies. The average range and efficiency of Korean vehicles have increased, with correspondingly slightly higher vehicle prices.

France drops to fourth place, while Japan drops from fourth to fifth place. As in the previous year, Japanese OEMs are focusing on the expansion of plug-in vehicles. Japanese manufacturers are placing few new all-electric vehicles on the market.

Although US BEVs are leaders with regard to electric range, the portfolios of all American OEMs increasingly include electrified SUVs and a bigger share of PHEVs, which reduces the average technological performance of the vehicles under evaluation. Both German and American vehicles belong in the high-price segment.

Industry. In terms of industry, China and USA share first place. However, China leads with absolute higher xEV (BEV and PHEV) as well as cell production.

In China, battery cell production in 2017-2022 is expected to increase by more than 1,000% compared to the same period last year (2016-2021). No other nation plans such a large expansion of its domestic cell production, confirming China’s leadership in terms of industry.

Market. Sales figures for battery and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles rose significantly in all countries except Japan in the period Q3 2018 - Q2 2019. For the first time, the share of partially or fully electrified vehicles in all new Chinese registrations exceeded the 5% mark. Compared to the previous period (2018), Chinese sales are growing at approximately 160%.

France, South Korea, the US and Germany exceeded the two percent mark of the xEV sales ratio for the first time. France is ranked second ahead of a strongly growing South Korean market (+189%). US ranks fourth with an increase in sales share of more than 2.3 percent of all newly registered vehicles.

The market outlook continues to be positive, but electric vehicles are less profitable for OEMs than conventional vehicles. Automakers could increase their profitability levels with new Battery-as-a-Service models. —Wolfgang Bernhart, Partner at Roland Berger

Besides being behind on cell production, European OEMs also have a profitability problem. The losses incurred in the switch to electric drives could be diminished through greater cost efficiency, but profitability would still struggle.

The revenue gap could be closed in the future by new business models focusing on Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS), the consultants suggest. Some providers are already offering a Battery-in-the-Cloud service for managing and monitoring the battery life of electric vehicles. It enables the recording of real-time data on charging speed, charging cycles and ambient temperature, among other things. With this information as a basis, recommendations can then be made regarding driving style or necessary maintenance checks.",[],2019-12-20 00:00:00
https://www.consultancy.asia/news/1463/roland-berger-study-confirms-china-the-worlds-leader-for-bike-sharing,Roland Berger study confirms China the world’s leader for bike-sharing,"A study from global consultancy Roland Berger has confirmed China as the world’s most prolific bike-sharing nation, with over 9 million bicycles now in circulation.

In an update on its 2016 global bike-sharing report, strategy and management consultancy Roland Berger has highlighted the dramatic increase in the number of bikes and bike-sharing schemes over the past two years, with the worldwide fleet expanding from around 1.2 million units in 2015 to over 10 million at the end of last year. The firm projects a further doubling in numbers to 20 million by just 2021.

Buoyed by ever more greatly congested cities and growing health and environmental concerns, along with consumer trends away from the accumulation of assets and a digitally-savvy modern milieu, the popularity of bike-sharing schemes continues to rise around the world, with 1,250 schemes of various model types now operating in 71 countries – up from around 1,000 in 2015 and including new global entrants Uber and Didi. While growing globally, and tipped to reach to a worth of €8 billion over the next few years, much of the recent rapid growth – like many things in the global consumer economy, such as the luxury fashion and electric vehicle industries – has come courtesy of an phenomenal boom in Chinese market, which has since 2015 added over 8 million bikes to its national fleet – predominantly in Shanghai and Beijing.

These cities with Shenzhen combined now have an approximate 50 percent share of the world’s total number of shared-bicycles. With the country’s biggest schemes previously in Wuhan, Hangzhou, Taiyuan and then Shanghai (with 280,000 bikes less than a third of the number in Wuhan), Beijing was in 2015 barely on the map. Now the city – which is home to over 20 million residents – has a bike-sharing fleet in excess of 2.3 million units, with Shanghai contributing a further 1.7 million to the global tally. According to Roland Berger, these numbers are only set to expand – projected at 20 percent growth annually through to 2021 – on the back of massive ongoing investments and continued public interest, with Asian market leaders ofo and Mobike already having some 200 million registered users apiece and an apparent $3 billion in venture capital having been amassed by Chinese private providers to further push Asian and global expansion.

For China, the consulting firm further points to a local bike manufacturing capacity upwards of 80 million units per year, a largely unregulated market, and unsaturated public demand as factors in the meteoric local rise in bike-sharing. However, as dramatic photos of mountainous bike dumps in the country attest, there are some concerns already for current over-saturation. Further, share-bike operators around the world have been feeling the squeeze from city authorities fed up with visual pollution and indiscriminate parking.

Such a clamp-down has occurred in Singapore, where unable to comply with a spate of new licensing regulations the locally-founded operator oBike has slipped into receivership and withdrawn a fleet of around 70,000 bicycles, with liquidators FTI Consulting fielding demands from thousands of disgruntled customers scrambling to retrieve some S$6.3 million in deposits. oBike is now being investigated by Singaporean authorities for misappropriation of funds.

The crash-and-burn stories of a sudden market proliferation are not an unfamiliar one, and Roland Berger predicts an upcoming period of consolidation in the bike-sharing domain; “Despite the promising opportunities offered by the burgeoning bike-sharing market, the rapid pace of growth is not without its pitfalls. Operators are faced with becoming the target of vandalism, or oversupply in certain cities. We predict the market will consolidate in the coming years, with a smaller number of high quality offerings surviving the initial boom to find longer term success,” the firm concludes.",[],2018-09-29 04:00:00+00:00

The selection comes after a tender was called, which drew bids from a number of firms across the world.

The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has turned to the consulting industry to help prepare for AFCON 2019. The tournament, which was due to take place in January two years from now, has already been postponed to June/July of the same year after the country was found in a state of unpreparedness.

Last year, President of CAF Malagasy Ahmad Ahmad declared that the country would not be ready, following a visit to the planned areas of action. A week before an inspection trip to the country this August, Big Four accounting and advisory firm PwC announced its withdrawal from the project, which further dealt a blow to the country’s prospects.

As a result, the CAF invited bids for the contract, and have selected Roland Berger to assist with organising the event. The consulting firm will conduct a comprehensive organisational audit, as well as an inspection of the infrastructural capability in the host nation before the tournament in 2019.

In addition, the firm has been assigned the duty of auditing and inspecting the CAF Centers of Excellence (COEs), which operate across Cameroon, Ethiopia and Senegal. The COEs host training and development workshops and seminars across these countries, with the primary objective of promoting football on the continent.

Currently, Roland Berger’s presence in Africa is limited to Casablanca in Morocco, where it established an office in 2008. The firm will send a team to Cameroon in weeks to come to oversee the auditing activities.",[],2017-12-28 07:00:00+00:00

With the backing of the financial investor, Diagnostiskt Centrum Hud aims to accelerate its growth in Sweden and the Nordics, said the firm’s chief executive officer Philip Jerlmyr.

“We are excited to partner with Bridgepoint in the next stage of our expansion and further build the best dermatology provider across the Nordics together with our colleagues,“ he said.

Founded in 2012 by Philip Jerlmyr and three dermatologists, Stockholm-based Diagnostiskt Centrum Hud is a provider of medical dermatology services focused on treating melanoma, psoriasis and other severe dermatology conditions. The company has grown its team to around 35 professionals, and is one of the more well-known players in the local dermatology market.

Facing a growing market – key drivers include an aging population and an increase in the incidence of skin diseases such as skin cancer – the company’s management team has set its sights on expanding its capacity and geographic footprint. “Today we operate six clinics across four Swedish cities. The funding will enable us to roll out and acquire new clinics in Sweden and across the Nordic region,” said Jerlmyr.

Buyer Bridgepoint, which focuses on the mid-market segment, was advised during the transaction by M&A advisors from Roland Berger (commercial due diligence), KPMG (financial and tax consultancy) and Vinge (legal advisory).

Ann Dahlman, a partner at Bridgepoint responsible for Nordic investments, welcomed Diagnostiskt Centrum Hud to its portfolio. “We are very impressed by DCH’s successful expansion to-date and we look forward to supporting the team to realise its next phase of expansion.”

The two organisations will advance commercial opportunities for Israeli technological innovation companies interested in operating within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).

Based on a recently signed memorandum of understanding (MoU), Roland Berger will collaborate with Start-Up Nation Central on a series of strategic initiatives. They will also carry out joint research and analysis, marketing and promotional activities.

Commenting on the partnership, Jeremie Kletzkine, vice president of business development at Start-Up Nation Central, said: “We aim to leverage the complementary characteristics of the UAE and Israeli tech industries to establish a robust Middle East innovation hub that will create an innovation powerhouse to address regional and global challenges.”

Start-Up Nation Central has already taken substantial steps to build bridges between the member states’ innovation ecosystems. In December 2020, it officially launched the UAE-IL Tech Zone, an exclusive platform aimed at bridging technological, entrepreneurial, business, venture capital and government collaborations between the UAE and Israel.

The growing community, already connecting more than 2,000 business, innovation and technology leaders from both countries, is gradually evolving to become a GCC regional community.

https://newsletter.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2018/04/24/wesleyan-students-win-prestigious-consulting-competition/,Wesleyan Students Win Prestigious Consulting Competition,"Imagine you are advising a company that is a leading producer of a certain type of fruit product in the United States. The Chinese market has recently opened for export of this fruit product. How should the company best respond to this new market opportunity in China? What is the competition likely to do?

This was the scenario facing 30 teams of students from across 16 schools in the Roland Berger Case for a Cause 2018 competition, which simulates the work of a strategy consultant. Wesleyan’s team of four students, sponsored by The Gordon Career Center, tied for first place in the competition, which benefits Make-A-Wish Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

According to Anne Laskowksi, business career advisor at the Gordon Career Center, this was Wesleyan’s second year participating in the competition. This year, the four students—Jake Kwang ’20, Rosanne Ng ’19, Carlo Medina ’18, and Justin Liew ’18—formed the team on their own. The group met up to three times each week to work on the case, with many additional hours of individual work each week.

Kwang said the team members’ diversity of backgrounds—in experience, gender, major, and home country—allowed them to build a strategy based on many unique perspectives. The students broke down the case into two steps using a top-down market approach. First, they used data provided to identify which products and which region would have unmet demand. Then, they developed a strategy to help the client firm enter the product markets while mitigating potential risks and constraints, said Kwang, a sophomore studying computer science and economics.

“We pitched a long-term growth strategy for a berry farm. It involved expanding their product line (without additional capital investment in production capabilities or sacrificing their current market share in North America) and expanding abroad into China through a mutually beneficial joint venture with a competitor,” he explained. “In the final round, we made an additional recommendation that the berry farm acquire a smaller supplier of berries at a fair price, because it synergized well with our expansion strategy.”

Wesleyan outcompeted 26 teams to make it to the finalist round with 3 other teams from different schools. Finalists in the competition were invited to the Boston offices of Roland Berger—a top global strategy consulting firm headquartered in Munich, Germany—in April to present in front of the firm’s partners and principals. Finalists also had a chance to participate in career mentorship discussions and private networking events.

As a result of their win, the Wesleyan students were awarded an automatic first-round interview with Roland Berger, which has 50 offices in 34 different countries.

“I strongly encourage Wes students to participate—even if they are freshmen or sophomores—because not only is it for a meaningful cause, but it’s also a way to break into the consulting profession,” said Kwang. “The prize is a guaranteed first-round interview for a summer internship or a full-time position.”

In addition, the competition helped the students learn many hard skills—including basic financial modeling, data visualization, and different forms of consulting frameworks—and soft skills, such as how to listen to colleagues, the right balance between taking charge and stepping back, and staying cheerful and friendly with colleagues at 4:00 in the morning, Kwang added.

“We are incredibly proud of these students, whose hard work and well-reasoned analysis allowed them to beat out top schools and represent Wesleyan at the highest level,” said Sharon Belden Castonguay, director of the Gordon Career Center. “We look forward to sponsoring another team next year!”",[],2018-04-24 00:00:00

https://www.consultancy.uk/news/14027/roland-berger-hits-major-milestone-50-years-in-business,Roland Berger hits major milestone: 50 years in business,"This week marks exactly 50 years of business for the firm created by German entrepreneur Roland Berger, who at the age of just 29, founded the consulting firm of the same name. Today, the management consulting firm belongs to the elite in the industry, and has successfully positioned itself among the likes of the large American consultancies McKinsey, BCG, Bain and Strategy&.

In 1967, at just 29 years old, company name-sake Roland Berger established ""Roland Berger International Marketing Consultants"" along with his assistant. The two-person outfit was based in Munich initially, and quickly rose to prominence, following a small-scale marketing assignment which lead to an opportunity to help merge four tourism companies into giant tour operator TUI – with Roland Berger encouraging the move toward critical size to outperform a strong competitor, Neckermann, who was the first to offer package tours. The foundation of TUI became the firm's breakthrough case in Germany, and following a number of further high-profile assignments, sales doubled annually leading to Roland Berger becoming Germany’s third largest consultancy by its sixth birthday.

Over the course of its first two decades, Roland Berger gradually shifted from its initial marketing focus into a strategy consultancy, a development which stood at the basis of the firm's rebranding to Roland Berger Strategy Consultants. The next decades saw the consulting firm expand its reach to include offices in every corner of the globe. Following from its first adventures beyond domestic territory, in 1969 to Milan, and São Paulo in 1976, Roland Berger has since built a presence in locations as far flung as Tokyo (in 1991), Shanghai (in 1998), Beirut (in 2007), Boston (in 2012) and Mumbai in 2013.

The continued period of change at the company – the management consulting industry has over time seen major change in client expectations and service portfolios – triggered a second large rebranding effort in 2015 to modernise the company’s image. In line with an expressed corporate aim of becoming the ""most valuable consultancy firm worldwide"", which meant that segments beyond strategy would be served, 'Strategy Consultants' was dropped from the brand and a revamped corporate logo was introduced. The new ""titanium B"" combined with the ""Roland Berger"" lettering is said to represent a juncture in the company’s history and the B is designed as a standalone, liquid object, to signify agility and flexibility.

At the forefront of the industry

Roland Berger has also become known as one of Europe’s most prestigious home grown consulting firms. In the latest Vault Top 50 consulting ranking for Europe, Roland Berger is the highest ranked consultancy after the well known US based firms such as McKinsey, BCG and Bain. Other well-known European origin strategy consulting firms include OC&C and L.E.K. Consulting. However, similarly to other firms such as OC&C and Booz & Company, Roland Berger attracted interest from suitors looking to co-opt the strategy firm by way of acquisition. Comparable to for instance Bain & Company, Arthur D. Little and A.T. Kearney, Roland Berger faced several close calls, beginning with a 2010 bid which almost saw the company picked up by Deloitte Consulting. The deal reportedly broke down due to a last minute intervention from founder Roland Berger, the honorary chairman of the supervisory board to this day, who pumped a further €80 million in investment into the firm to retain independence.

Three years later, in a more difficult market for strategy consultants, merger talks resumed, with more Big Four interested in poaching Roland Berger resulting in a tug of war, which ultimately ended in stalemate. Despite Roland Berger’s expansions into Manama, Bahrain, Doha, Lagos and Seoul at the time not yielding the desired acceleration in results, the partner team of the German firm decided to retain independence once more. Since then, Roland Berger has made sustained efforts to put the deal talks to rest by focusing on a sustainable independence strategy, with ambitious targets formed to triple the group’s size. Roland Berger are the largest domestic consultancy in Germany now, in a consulting market worth upwards of €25.2 billion.

New generation

Today, with around 2,400 employees worldwide, Roland Berger is an independent partnership wholly owned by its approximately 220 partners, and is presently led by Charles-Edouard Bouée, who was elected as CEO by the firm’s partners in 2014 – taking over from Burkhard Schwenker, who was elected to the supervisory board at the same time. Having joined the firm in 2003, Bouée became the first non-German to head the largest international strategy consultancy of European origin. In 2016, he penned an article commenting on the potential consequences of the UK’s Brexit vote, suggesting that the process may take a toll on the UK economy, as entrepreneurs might find it easier creating and scaling their businesses inside the EU.

Thinking of his time with the firm, which currently totals 16 years, Bouée said, “I am proud of being part of Roland Berger and have always been happy with my choice, since joining almost 16 years ago. I am also very grateful to all the colleagues who have contributed in the past to making this venture – the only leading consultancy of European origin – a frank success.”

According to Bouée, in a piece he shared on LinkedIn, the firm remains bullish having fended off a succession of suitors to remain its own boss. The firm’s resilient business model of independent Excellence, Empathy and Entrepreneurship has, according to its CEO, proven its resistance for 50 years. Now, the company are keen to lay the foundation for the next generation – in order to always serve their clients changing needs and help their businesses and organisations fit for the future.

In a piece he shared on LinkedIn, Bouée stated, “In 2017, Roland Berger is a strong and independent company that is on a clear growth track with a modern organization and services offering. 50 years after the first consulting project was conducted, we are on our way to becoming the most valuable high value-added service firm in the market, by strengthening our knowledge capabilities across all functional areas and regions, expanding our technology capacities and adding selected capital services.” The firm’s strength is largely thanks to its founder according to the piece, which also paid homage to the spirit of Roland Berger, “A big thank you to our founder for creating this incredible firm with its unique spirit, which is still present today and serves as an inspiration for all of us.”

Bouée then concluded by looking ahead, “At Roland Berger, we help our clients to own their own future! And we are all ready to meet the challenge of becoming better every day over the next 50 years.”",[],2017-09-22 06:07:00+00:00

The duo were part of a global wave of 15 promotions across Roland Berger’s international operations.

The opening weeks of the year traditionally see a bumper list of promotions announced across the consulting industry. 2020 is no exception to this, with Oliver Wyman appointing four new Partners in its London office, FTI Consulting promoting seven Senior Managing Directors in its UK wing as part of 34 similar promotions globally, and Bain & Company added five new Managing Directors in its office in the capital.

Now, Roland Berger has also announced the election of a host of new Partners. In the UK, this saw due diligence experts Kai Balder and Hrishikesh Potey both promoted after lengthy stays with the firm.

Balder joined Roland Berger’s London office in 2009, and has since focused on industrial products and services, life sciences and private equity work. Functionally, he has strong expertise in portfolio reviews, business model innovation, target operating model design and commercial due diligence. He is currently the UK lead for B2B electronics at the firm, holding a Mechanical Engineering degree from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.

Potey meanwhile first arrived at Roland Berger as a Summer Associate in 2012. Inspired by his initial spell as an intern, Potey returned to the London office one year later, having completed an MBA at the London Business School. He became a Principal in 2018, and has worked with clients on a range of issues including business strategy, pricing and commercial due diligence. Potey’s main area of focus is M&A advice for private equity and corporate clients in sectors such as infrastructure, industrials and business services.

The UK promotions came as part of the elevation of 15 individuals across Roland Berger’s global operations, to support the company’s growth across its many regions. The other 13 new Partners included Christian Böhler, Ulrich Kleipass, Adrian Pielken and Volker Rothfuss in Germany; Frank Schrijver and Sjors van der Zee in the Netherlands; Johannes Distler and Hani Tohme in the Middle East; Viktoriya Bondarets in Ukraine; Truong Bui in Singapore; Stephan Essig in Qatar; Christian Heinis in France; and Konstantin Shirokinskiy in the US.

https://www.consultancy.asia/news/4193/11000-bank-branches-in-southeast-asia-to-shut-over-next-decade,"11,000 bank branches in Southeast Asia to shut over next decade","The shift to digital banking is putting physical outlets out of favour in Southeast Asia – with a fifth of the region’s brick & mortar branches expected to close over the next decade. A new Roland Berger report takes a closer look at these trends.

Money transfers, payments, loan applications, financial advice and a host of other banking services can now be accessed online – eliminating the tedious visit to the local branch. Convenience was the biggest driver of this shift before 2020, now combined with the safety of managing affairs from home amid infection risks.

Banks that have been investing heavily in digitalisation – and losing hefty sums to credit losses and flattened interest during the pandemic – can now cut costs by shedding some of their brick & mortar cost base. Embodying this strategy are banks in Southeast Asia, where Roland Berger expects 11,000 branch closures leading up to 2030 – around 18% of the current physical banking presence.

Closures will vary by country – based on a range of factors laid out by Roland Berger’s Singapore-based senior partner Philipe Chassat.

“Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia will see a significant branch consolidation as their economies continue to grow, government regulations/incentives facilitate more digital banking activities and banks speed-up their efforts to adjust their existing large branch networks after having been slow to do so in recent years.”

These markets – alongside Brunei and Singapore – will see a closure rate of between 20% and 30% over the next decade. Indonesia will see the highest cut by volume – more than 7,000 branches – while Singapore will record the highest percentage closure at 31%. By contrast, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar will all see an upward trend in physical presence till 2030 – continuing a steady climb from the last decade.

“As a consequence of their relatively underdeveloped banking sectors, these countries currently have the lowest branch densities in Southeast Asia. As such, an increase in branch footprint and an associated increase in financial inclusion are expected as the banking systems in these markets further develop,” explained Chassat.

That said, the aggregate physical presence across Southeast Asia is in for a dip. Economic factors aside, the researchers highlight how this shift is largely driven by a young, digitally inclusive population across the region. At current rates, an additional 111 million digital natives – now between the ages of 8 and 17 – will enter the bankable population by 2030.

Comfortable with tech, and served by a whole host of new digital banking tools, these ranks of young consumers will likely drive many of the region’s physical branches into obscurity – bringing Southeast Asia up to speed with the global banking landscape.

Catching up

Per the report, advanced economies across North America and Europe have recorded a steady decline in brick & mortar banking over the last ten years. North America’s commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults has dropped by around 6,000 since 2010, while Western Europe has registered a staggering ~40,000 decline over the same period.

Asia Pacific’s physical banking presence has been increasing over the last decade, and Southeast Asia is now leading the region towards a more digitalised, efficient and inclusive banking landscape. Branches that remain will likely take on a whole new avatar as advanced links in a complex, omnichannel, customer-centric service offerings.

“Banks must be prepared to radically rethink their branch networks for the next ten years,” concluded Chassat. ”They need to address the upcoming challenges of the decline of the branch role sooner rather than later, preparing for a redesigned, repurposed and reduced network. Failing to do so will profoundly impact retail banks’ profitability, leaving oversised branch networks underutilised.”",[],2021-05-31 05:03:00+00:00

Every year, thousands of students graduate from Spain’s roughly 60 universities, and according recent data from graduate employer agency Universum, strategy and management consulting consistently ranks among the five most popular sectors to start a career in.

The management consulting sector enjoys its popularity for a number of well-known characteristics, including diversity in the job (consultants typically work on different types of projects for clients in different industries), the steep learning curve, excellent professional development opportunities, and the ability to contribute to business and social impact.

The high-end segment of the industry – strategy consulting – is notorious for its impact and prestige, but also the high demands that come with the job. Strategy consultants work with the most senior clients (chief executives, executives, senior managers) on their boardroom agenda, including on topics such as strategy, growth, mergers & acquisitions and business model innovation.

https://www.consultancy.in/news/2507/saumitra-sehgal-leads-consulting-firm-roland-berger-in-india,Saumitra Sehgal leads consulting firm Roland Berger in India,"Global consulting firm Roland Berger has appointed Saumitra Sehgal as its new Managing Partner for India and surrounding regions. Senior executives at the firm’s global practice say that the appointment is a bid to better manage its substantial expansion strategies in the Indian advisory market.

Sehgal has only been at Roland Berger since November last year, when he joined the firm as a Partner, and has since ascended rapidly through the ranks. He was appointed the firm’s Head of Financial Services in March this year, and now takes over the top spot for the Indian subcontinent.

A graduate of the Indian Institute of Management, Sehgal has two decades of professional experience that spans a range of industries. He began at global FMCG giant PepsiCO, where he spent nearly three years and ended up as a Territory Development Manager, before moving to Bacardi-Martini India.

During four years at Bacardi, he rose to the position of Marketing Manager, following which he shifted to banking corporation HSBC. He began his foray into the consulting industry at Accenture in 2008, where he would remain for the next decade, latterly serving as a Managing Director.

Over the course of his career, Sehgal has developed considerable expertise in the domain of market entry and growth strategies, in addition to keeping abreast with the more contemporary trends of digital transformation. His experience in financial services and strategy consulting have made him a remarkable asset at Roland Berger.

In his new role of Managing Partner, Sehgal takes over from Ravi Kushan, who joined in January last year to help build scale in the firm’s India practice and establish a Financial Services division. Kushan has brought the firm considerable momentum in the country, building on seven years of consolidation in the Indian market previously. The firm is now ready for its next phase of expansion, as it continues to compete with other strategy consulting giants in the country, including McKinsey & Company, Boston Consulting Group and Bain & Company, among others.

Sehgal noted the firm’s strong position in India, and expressed his readiness for the next phase. “Roland Berger has had a strong start in the Indian strategy consulting market over the last seven years and has built a reputation as the go-to consultants for robust advice, global perspectives and solutions that balance innovation and pragmatism. We look forward to growing this brand and our team to serve clients in sectors such as automotive, industrials, aerospace and defense, and financial services,” he said.

Stefan Schaible, a global leader at Roland Berger and chief executive of the firm’s home region of Germany, echoed other business leaders in expressing the significance of India as a market in the near future. “India is one of the fastest growing consulting markets and a geography of importance to Roland Berger. As a global firm, our network can help connect Indian clients with international clients and learn from best practices around the world. Saum's appointment will help catalyse our growth in the Indian market and we will make continued investments to support this growth.""",[],2019-09-24 05:00:00+00:00
https://www.consultancy.uk/news/24650/philip-dunne-leads-strategy-consultancy-roland-berger-in-uk,Philip Dunne leads strategy consultancy Roland Berger in UK,"Former Kearney and EY-Parthenon Partner Philip Dunne has been appointed to head up strategy consultancy Roland Berger’s UK wing. He brings more than 25 years of industry and consulting experience to the role.

Commenting on his appointment, Philip Dunne said, “I'm really excited to have started at Roland Berger as UK Managing Partner, even in such difficult times. I've always had the greatest respect for the firm, having experienced first-hand the quality of their work and people.”

According to the new UK Managing Partner, he considers his role to now be to “awaken the giant.” In doing so, he hopes to enable the UK firm to take up its “rightful place as a powerhouse” in the strategy consulting scene, with full sector coverage and a broad range of strategy & operations propositions.

Founded by namesake Roland Berger in 1967 in Munich, the firm has since established itself as the largest German origin consultancy, and one of the few European origin strategy consultancies able to compete with the likes of US-headquartered McKinsey & Company, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Bain & Company, Oliver Wyman, Kearney and Strategy&.

With revenues of €600 million, Roland Berger is also much larger than the majority of other European strategic consultancies, such as L.E.K. Consulting, OC&C Strategy Consultants and Corporate Value Associates – however, the firm clearly believes its UK arm has plenty of untapped potential.

“I've always considered the UK practice to be a “sleeping giant” when compared with the firm's market position elsewhere in Europe and globally,” said Dunne. Germany remains by a distance Roland Berger’s main market, while the firm also has a leading presence in the strategy consulting markets of France, the Netherlands, Eastern Europe and the Middle East.

Dunne brings over 25 years of industry and consulting experience to help Roland Berger UK accelerate its position. Having commenced his career as an engineer by training, he spent five years with BAE Systems, during which he designed missiles for British Aerospace. This was followed by five years in France with Michelin in design and manufacturing roles – before an MBA at Cranfield saw him shift into consulting, joining Kearney in 1995.

He spent 19 years at Kearney, formerly A.T. Kearney, eventually becoming Kearney UK’s Managing Partner and head of the M&A Practice. Then, Dunne joined EY, heading up its EY-Parthenon team – EY’s division dedicated to strategic consulting services formed after the Big Four picked up The Parthenon Group.

As UK Managing Partner for Roland Berger, Dunne will now lead the growth of the practice, also leveraging the firm's expertise in operations, performance improvement and restructuring for the benefit of both corporate and private equity clients.",[],2020-05-26 05:03:00+00:00
https://www.consultancy.uk/news/13453/roland-berger-predict-in-flight-wifi-revolution-is-imminent,Roland Berger predicts in-flight Wi-Fi revolution is imminent,"Airlines are increasingly expected to offer in-flight connectivity options, with consumers dependent on using a variety of digital tools - even in the air. Utilising data gathered by a Gesellschaft für Konsumforschung study of 9,000 consumers across 30 countries, researchers at Roland Berger considered current trends in the market, while with the consulting firm drawing up steps the commercial aviation industry can take to open up a new digital revenue stream in the air.

The use of electronic and transmitting device has, for the longest time, not been permitted on aeroplanes. The reasons for the blanket ban were technical, with possible interference of sensitive on-board electronic systems potentially jeopardising the lives of hundreds of people. In recent years debate surrounding the effect of devices on key systems has occurred however, particularly in light of technical advances, which have made certain in-flight connectivity options more practical.

The debate has given way to some airlines permitting the use of electronic devices in some circumstances, while new communications technologies have allowed them to offer new in-flight communications services – although still at a considerable premium to similar ground-based propositions.

Meanwhile the global prediction traveller numbers is projected to grow at CAGR 4.8% between 2015 and 2035, which undoubtedly will couple with changing consumer expectations to pressure airlines to introduce more connectivity options. According to Roland Berger, 90% of short-haul passengers in Europe want to use their own smart-phone, 80% their tablet and 46% their laptop in-flight.

According to the study, consumer preferences on short-haul increasingly favour the option for internet related connectivity, more passengers (54%) would prefer in-flight Internet to in-flight meals (19%) or entertainment (16%).

Airlines themselves are increasingly hard-pressed to derive additional revenue streams from customers – customers are already increasingly less likely to pay for a variety of added value services, such as in-flight meals. The study notes however, that they are willing to pay for Wi-Fi connectivity, at 69% of European customers, 67% of Asian-Pacific region customers and 64% of Latin American customers.

The also firm notes that new technologies for setting up in-flight connectivity are advancing, with an additional benefit to the cost/bit price of services. New technologies, such as hybrid satellite-ground networks, metamaterial flat panel antennas and traffic optimised capacity mean that for customers the quality of service is set to improve while for airlines, the cost of running the service is set to decrease.

The benefit for airlines from selling in-fight connectivity access is estimated at between €1-4 per passenger, with revenue derived from the sale of connectivity itself as well as additional benefits occurring through services sold through the connectivity offering more widely.

Kai-Marcus Peschl from Roland Berger explained: ""More important than charging for Internet access is the possibility that airlines will have to offer their passengers personalised shopping or other services. This is what will generate additional business for the airlines.""

According to the study the addition of in-flight connectivity to the wider package ‘completes’ the digital transformation in aviation triangle, by offering high-speed internet, targeted retail and personal shopping and more efficient flight operations. The other part of the triangle includes digital operations, from the tracking of equipment to passenger service system, and multi-channel shopping, including loyalty programmes and personal shipping.

Commenting on in-flight connectivity as part of a wider trend in digital in the aviation ecosystem, Peschl added, ""Internet on board is not the only step but it is an important step en route to the digital transformation of the airline industry. With the right partners and product offerings in place, airlines have great opportunities to improve their efficiency and generate ancillary revenue.”",[],2017-06-06 05:06:00+00:00
https://www.consultancy.asia/news/3848/covid-19-has-made-digitalisation-a-necessity-for-thai-banks,Covid-19 has made digitalisation a necessity for Thai banks,"The fate of Thai banks rests on medium to long term dividends on their digital investments, as Covid-19 cuts profitability. A new Roland Berger report presents the story so far, and the way forward.

In February, Roland Berger published a status report on Thailand’s banking sector – at a time when the Covid-19 economic impact was very much a peripheral issue. Profitability and returns on equity (ROEs) were key challenges even back then, mainly owing to hefty digital investments.

Thai banks entered 2020 amid what Roland Berger describes as the digital transformation “valley of no return” – where large sums being invested in the current term will take many years to yield dividends such as growth in revenue, efficiency and profitability. Key to surviving this interim period is cutting the cost base.

Per Roland Berger’s February analysis, savings of just over $3 billion in the lead up to 2024 – 5% of the Thai banking sector’s total cost base – would have been enough to cross the valley of no return per se. This was before Covid-19. The firm’s latest analysis puts a cost saving imperative of around $6 billion on Thai banks – nearly 9% of their current cost base.

Covid-19 impact

The fact is that Covid-19 has been a major blow for banking around the world, and Thailand is no different. “Businesses and individuals are expected to be more conservative with their liquidity, growth investments and spending over the next years, posing a great challenge for banks in revenue generation,” explained Philippe Chassat, Roland Berger Senior Partner and head of its Southeast Asia Financial Services Competence Centre.

Compared to 2019, Roland Berger estimates a dip of 7% in operating income for Thailand’s banking sector in 2020. Credit losses are among the chief threats to profitability, with the non-performing loan ratio crossing 3% in the second quarter of last year. This boosts banks’ risk costs as well, spelling a challenging period for the sector – likely to extend well beyond 2020.

“We estimate that the erosion of the return on equity is expected to worsen by a further decline of 1.1% in 2020 and 1.3% in 2021 with the prolonged effects of the pandemic,” added Chassat. And with many banks in the very middle of the valley of no return, there is limited liquidity to navigate these challenges.

“Existing rigid investment structures, in particular for digital transformation programs, along with the higher uncertainty and the overall deterioration of debt quality, will also directly impact the banks' bottom line,” explained Luca Turba, a Roland Berger principal in Bangkok.

So savings are of the essence – preferably around $6 billion worth by 2024. Yet, even this figure is riddled with risky assumptions. One is that the Covid-19 healthcare crisis will subside in 2021. The second is that government support for businesses will persist until the crisis subsides and the economy regains momentum. Neither of these scenarios has a reliable foundation for now.

Perhaps the biggest assumption, meanwhile, is that the heavy digital investments will yield the expected level of returns in time. Provided that digital dividends show up in numbers, Thai banks will emerge from the valley of no return with ROEs of over 8% – the healthy average for recent years.

On the flipside, if digital investments fail to produce returns, ROEs would decline gradually and flatten below 7% by 2024 – a scenario where profitability will fast evaporate. And this is accounting for the billions in recommended cost savings.

Moving forward

According to Roland Berger, the only way forward is to move with the times. For all its challenges, Covid-19 has also thrown up some opportunities for the banking sector. For one, digital banking adoption has boomed, as physical retail and business takes a back seat. For banks, this is a chance to cut down on their brick & mortar presence – no doubt a source of substantial cost savings.

Technology can help here too. Leveraging the latest in data analytics, banks have an overview of their entire physical network and performance. “These tools offer banks the opportunity to define the optimal branch density and location to maximise profitability or revenue generation,” said Chassat.

For the branches that do remain, Roland Berger recommends tech enhancements to develop the “branch of the future” – where efficiency, customer experience, and omnichannel integration will all come together to deliver the maximum value for minimuim investment. With the fate of Thai banks resting on digital dividends, such strategic investments mark an optimal way forward.",[],2021-01-20 05:00:00+00:00
https://www.consultancy.eu/news/5845/anne-bioulac-re-joins-capgemini-invent-as-a-vice-president,Anne Bioulac re-joins Capgemini Invent as a Vice President,"Capgemini Invent has strengthened its senior team in France with the appointment of Anne Bioulac, a former senior partner of Roland Berger.

Anne Bioulac joins Capgemini Invent – the management consulting arm of IT services giant Capgemini – from Augustus Intelligence, a New York based start-up specialised in the development of artificial intelligence solutions, where she as a managing director and most recently transitioned to the role of strategic advisor.

Before that, Bioulac spent nearly twenty-five years in the consulting industry, fifteen of which at Roland Berger in France. At the strategy consulting firm, she grew the ranks to senior partner and co-head of the firm’s 300-strong Paris office. She was a member of Roland Berger’s Technology, Media and Telcom, Digital and Information Management practices, and was a leader in its Terra Numerata network.

Earlier in her career, Bioulac worked four years for Oliver Wyman and over a decade at Capgemini Invent (at the time Capgemini Consulting) and Bossard Consultants (which was acquired by Capgemini in 1997 and became part of its consulting wing).

https://www.consultancy.uk/news/2284/roland-berger-mining-industry-has-91-billion-in-cash,Roland Berger: Global mining industry holds $91 billion in cash,"The mining industry 'sits' on a pile of cash the size of $90 billion, research by Roland Berger shows. In the past 15 years, the mining industry has enjoyed big ups and downs, and while 30% of the mining industry’s capacity is unprofitable, the firm shows that wider fundamentals remain strong. In addition to the cash, both the industry's operating and human capital costs are down.

Mining has in the past decades enjoyed considerable growth, and with the coming online of the BRICs region, demand for a period in the 2000s outstripped supply. As a result, commodity prices increased, allowing for mining companies to expand into what would otherwise have been uneconomical claims, with the general aim of getting the oar as quickly to market.

In a recently released report from Roland Berger, titled ‘Mining Rebound: Why 2015 is the perfect year to prepare your mining operations for the next cycle’, the consulting firm considers the changing fortunes of the mining industry in general.

Mining slow-down

During the period between 2004 and 2012, iron ore seaborne demand increased from 606 million tons to 1,157 million tons. The massive demand, particularly from BRICs, resulted in a 15% per year commodity price increases in the 2000s, and the corresponding fixation on winning oar rather than other considerations. Recent years however, have seen a slump in demand as China and other BRICs fall foul to the dangers of overheating economies. One consequence, according to the firm, is a resultant net oversupply of minerals which has resulted in the commodity metal price index to fall by 40% between 2011 and 2015. This drop has had the further consequence of laying waste to around 30% of capacity that is unprofitable at current market conditions.

Although the down-turn is considerable, it has also come at a time in which the environment on which mining is dependent is relatively stable and abundant. Oil prices continue to be low, which reduce operating costs, while a strong US dollar will generally help all miners with US dollar revenues that have not yet fully optimised their operations to cope with lower commodity prices in the short term. Other positive factors affecting the industry include the relatively cheap cost of key mining equipment, reducing operating costs as well as less competition for skilled labour, reducing capital costs. Furthermore according to the report, with the sometimes inefficient practice of getting the product to market without considering operational costs, many mines still have considerable scope to streamline operations and thereby improve their operating cost profiles.

Cash pile

The consultancy notes that the industry as a whole is – in cash terms – in a relatively strong position. Since the start of 2000 the industry has increased the cash available to mining companies from $7 billion to a record of $152 billion in 2010, before the downturn seeing the industry burn through around $60 billion to plateau at around $90 billion over the past two years.

The authors conclude: “Since the decrease of mineral prices in 2011, savvy operators have been very cautious in not depleting their cash reserves when they first needed time to adjust their cost structure to this new pricing environment. Since then, cost, working capital and CAPEX optimisation programs have started to deliver results and 2015 will be the first year of renewed positive cash generation.”",[],2015-07-23 00:00:00+00:00

Koerner is based in Roland Berger's Munich office.

Prior to joining Roland Berger, Regina Koerner worked at Strategic Corporate Communications as a Consultant for seven years, providing a range of branding, PR and other strategic communication services to clients across Germany. Concurrently, between 2015 and midway through 2016, Koerner worked as a Director of Marketing & Communications at A.T. Kearney, responsible leading DACH Marketing & Communications activities, among others.

Koerner’s earlier roles include a one year stint at sustainable society charity the Bertelsmann Foundation, as Senior Vice President of Communications; Head of Communications at Fairtrade International (FLO), from 2009 until 2010 and Director of Communications at the World Future Council, for around one year. Previously she worked in the media industry, serving RTL Television for twelve years and Deutsche Welle TV for around two years, where Koerner started her career.

Koerner holds a Master of Arts in Journalism from the University of Missouri - Columbia School of Journalism.

The appointment of Koerner, a former third sector communications expert, as Head of Global Marketing & Communications, sees her take over from Christiane Diekmann, who is leaving the firm after more than a decade in the role.

Roland Berger CEO Charles-Edouard Bouée remarks, ""Regina Koerner brings the expertise and creativity to take our global communications to the next level of excellence. With her excellent track record in branding & positioning and her skills in global PR and corporate communications Regina is an outstanding asset for our thought leadership.""",[],2016-11-03 06:01:00+00:00
https://www.consultancy.uk/news/12722/roland-berger-consultant-zihao-xu-moves-over-to-octopus-ventures,Roland Berger consultant Zihao Xu moves over to Octopus Ventures,"Roland Berger consultant Zihao Xu has moved over to Octopus Ventures, a London and New York-based venture capital investor. Xu spent nearly six years in Roland Berger’s London office.

Zihao Xu joined Roland Berger (at the time Roland Berger Strategy Consultants, prior to its rebranding) in March 2011, after gaining his Bachelor of Arts in Economics and Management from the University of Oxford. At the consulting firm, Xu contributed to several strategic, operational and commercial due diligence engagements across a wide range of sectors, including Aerospace & Defence, Automotive, Industrials, Energy and Private Equity. Although he was based in London, Xu’s project experience spanned Europe, North America and Asia.

After six years in the consulting industry Xu recently decided to embark on a new adventure, and per the 1st of August he has joined Octopus Ventures, a venture capitalist best known for backing the likes of Secret Escapes, eve Sleep, SwiftKey and Zoopla Property Group. Octopus Ventures, the venture capital arm of the Octopus Group, an investment management company with more than £6 billion of assets under management, typically invests from £250,000 up to £25 million in first or second rounds of funding.

The startup scene is not new for Xu – he is also an entrepreneur himself as the founder of a sunglasses and lifestyle brand Canopy Sunglasses. Founded in 2014, Xu holds responsibility for every aspect of the business including strategy, sourcing, branding and web development. Canopy Sunglasses has so far been sold in 14 countries across Europe, Asia, North America and Oceania, mainly through online retail and re-sellers.

Xu joins Octopus Ventures’ investment team as an Investment Associate. In the role, he will work with investment managers to identify promising startups across the UK and Europe, as well as play a role in advising enterprises already part of Octopus Ventures’ portfolio.

Globally, venture capital funding into startups is on a high, hitting a record $128 billion in 2015, although the scene has been losing some steam throughout 2016 on the back of uncertain valuations and a drop in economic sentiment. Octopus Ventures is a fast growing player in the market – the company recently raised an additional £100 million to invest into early stage European businesses.

Commenting on the appointment, Alex Macpherson from Octopus Ventures says: “Zihao’s experience in having run a business himself as well as assessing markets and delivering top line strategic advice to global businesses makes him a great addition to the team”.

Xu says that he is delighted with the move, stating, “There’s a huge amount of entrepreneurial talent coming out of the UK and Europe. I’m super excited to be joining Octopus in helping to support and serve this community. Coming from a background in advising large corporates, I’m looking forward to getting stuck in at the other end of the spectrum. Given the track record of Octopus Ventures, particularly the year they have had so far in 2016, in my opinion there is no better place to work with unusually talented entrepreneurs.”",[],2016-11-09 07:00:00+00:00
https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2020-07-23/new-study-projects-uam-market-80-billion-2050,New Study Projects UAM Market at $80 Billion by 2050,"More than 160,000 eVTOL aircraft are expected to be carrying passengers in urban air mobility (UAM) services by 2050, according to new research by aviation consultants Roland Berger. In a report presented for the FIA Connect event on July 23, the company said that it expects such operations to be evenly divided between what it defined as “city taxi” (on-demand flights of 15-50 km), “airport shuttle” (also 15-50 km, or up to around 30 miles), and “intercity” (scheduled flights of between 50 and 250 km, or up to around 150 miles).

Of the $80 billion annual value projected for the new UAM market by 2050, Roland Berger calculates that airport shuttle and inter-city flights will account for most of that amount (respectively 50 and 40 percent), while city taxi journeys take the remaining 10 percent.

“To start with we think [UAM] services will be quite highly-priced and exclusive, but in the longer term [as operating costs become more scalable] it will be more like today’s premium public transport services, such as taxis,” said Manfred Hader, head of Roland Berger’s aerospace and defense practice.

Some of the many contenders to enter the eVTOL market are pushing hard for early service entry, perhaps as soon as 2023. However, the vast majority of some 2,100 aerospace industry executives surveyed by Roland Berger indicated that they do not find that timeframe credible, with 51 percent saying they expect it to happen in between 5 and 10 years, 34 percent predicting more than 10 years, and just 13 percent expecting it within five years. Two percent of respondents said that UAM will never happen.

Roland Berger’s Center for Smart Mobility also has tracked through its UAM Radar the status of 100 UAM launch projects around the world to identify where the early adopter communities will appear. It identified 54 prospective city-based UAM projects in Europe, 25 in the Asia-Pacific region, 21 in North and South America, six in Africa, and two in the Middle East.

In Dallas, Texas, ride-hailing group Uber says it will be ready to launch revenue flights with one or more of its eight eVTOL manufacturing partners in 2023. Test flights could start in the city by the end of 2020, and Uber continues to actively lay the infrastructure groundwork needed to support operations.

In the Chinese city of Guangzhou, eVTOL pioneer EHang has conducted demonstration flights since 2018, including some carrying passengers. The company has not yet announced a timeline for full revenue services to begin but the Civil Aviation Administration of China has allowed it significant latitude for the trial operations.

In Paris, Airbus is partnering with city public transportation agency RATP to launch pilot eVTOL operations during the 2024 Summer Olympic Games, due to take place in the French capital. Many suggest that full-scale services might not get underway until 2030, however.

“The startup companies are typically being more bullish for operations to start by 2025 at the latest because their funding depends on having good news to attract investors,” said Hader. “The legacy aerospace companies are being more cautious and are looking at the late 2020s or early 2030s.”

Roland Berger’s research has confirmed its view that public acceptance stands as a major barrier to UAM adoption. It pointed to recent research by Airbus showing that almost 56 percent of 1,500 respondents have concerns about the safety of individuals on the ground while 49 percent expressed concern about noise.

The consultancy endorsed the growing consensus that eVTOL operations might gain more early traction with cargo-carrying operations that could prove the safety and noise case for passenger applications. Its study showed that the German capital Berlin might be able to support around 1,200 unmanned aircraft delivering 4 million packages each year, the equivalent of one for each Berlin resident.

Overall, Roland Berger does not expect the Covid-19 crisis to significantly affect the timeline for the emerging UAM sector. However, the report did suggest that some companies might now struggle to find the funding they need to advance their aircraft to type certification.

Eric Allison, head of Uber Elevate, confirmed that viewpoint. He told a separate FIA Connect webinar that some eVTOL developers at the earlier stages of “prototyping” their aircraft might struggle due to Covid disruption and increased difficulty securing funding. However, he stressed that several companies are now making good progress towards type certification.

Allison said that Uber is now prioritizing service entry for all-electric eVTOLs, as opposed to hybrid-electric models. He said that battery technology can now support the relatively short flights envisioned by its planned Uber Air urban and suburban networks. In the early stages, Uber projects it can achieve flight hour costs of less than $700, and Allison said the pricetag will go “much lower” as it scales up operations.",[],2020-07-23 00:00:00

Now into its 17th edition, the ASEAN Ports & Shipping conference will land in Cambodia in September, with over 500 delegates including government officials and freight, ports and logistics professionals expected to attend in what is described as the largest gathering of shipping industry executives in the region. Among the confirmed speakers; Anthonie Versluis, managing partner for Roland Berger Malaysia and head of the firm’s global ports practice.

Set to take place over the 10th to the 12th at NagaWorld in Phnom Penh, Versluis will kick off proceedings following the conference moderator’s opening remarks with an address on the “Future adaptation on global economic conditions and its effect on ASEAN trade growth”, before later moderating a session on “The future of ports in the Fourth Industrial Revolution”. Versluis has spent the majority of his thirty-plus year career based in Southeast Asia.

Starting out as a project manager for Arthur D. Little in Singapore in 1997, Versluis three years later joined Dutch engineering and management consultancy Arcadis as a senior technical advisor (Versluis holds an MSc in Industrial Management from the University of Twente, together with having since completed Harvard Business School Executive Education), initially posted in Jakarta before a detour to the Caribbean.

In 2000, Versluis returned to the region as a Director of Southeast Asia Strategy & Transformation with Cap Gemini Ernst & Young (Capgemini’s consulting division as of last year operates under the integrated brand Capgemini Invent), before crossing for a second stint with ADL, this time as an Associate Director based in Kuala Lumpur with additional responsibilities in the Middle East. In 2011 he joined Roland Berger.

At the firm (where in Malaysia he is joined by recently promoted senior partner John Low), Versluis serves clients throughout Asia in the energy, chemicals, transportation and government sectors on issues relating to strategy, logistics & shipping, infrastructure development, corporate & business strategy, and management and restructuring among other areas. He returns to the annual Asean Ports & Shipping event following an appearance in Johor last year.

According to the conference organisers, Transport Events, Versluis has over his career managed or directed approximately 50 port development projects in Malaysia, China, Indonesia, the Maldives, Saudi Arabia, Europe and various countries of the Caribbean. He will feature among 30 speakers in total, including Red Sea Gateway Terminal director for global investments Gagan Seksaria – a former associate director in the transport & logistics practice of KPMG India.

“PPAP and PAS are delighted to host this event in our vibrant city of Phnom Penh,” said Lou Hei Bavy and Kim Chhun, the respective CEOs of the Phnom Penh Autonomous Port (PPAP) and Sihanoukville Autonomous Port (PAS, which handles 70 percent of Cambodia’s imports and exports). “There will be commercial opportunities for sixty exhibitors and sponsors to network directly with the delegates at this major international maritime event for the Asean region.”",[],2019-08-29 04:02:00+00:00

The co-leaders take responsibility for growth within the fast growing and transforming region.

Philippe Chassat became a Partner at Roland Berger in 2005, working for the firm’s Financial Services Practice in France. In 2006 he moved to Belgium, taking on a Partner position in the firm’s Belgium Financial Services unit. Roughly five year later Chassat moved to Asia (based out of Singapore) to serve as the firm's Financial Services Head for South East Asia. Chassat holds a Master of Arts in Economy & Finance and an Master of Science in Capital Markets & Corporate Finance from Institut d'Etudes politiques de Paris. He also attended the Stanford Executive Program at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.

He holds a Master of Science in Engineering and Economics from the AgroParisTech, Institut des sciences et industries du vivant et de l’environnement and a Master of Business Administration from the Columbia University - Columbia Business School.

The promotion of Chassat and Le Couédic sees the Partners take on joint leadership of the firm’s Asia-Pacific (APAC) region Financial Services Practice. Both bring 20 years of experience to the role, as well as extensive regional experience. They take responsibility for the expansion of the firm’s regional business, which continues to be under pressure from the Chinese market slowdown, by offering a range of solutions to current and new regional clients. Across the board the outlook for the region is bright however, found an analysis by Roland Berger's APAC team released late last year.



Charles-Edouard Bouée, CEO at Roland Berger, says, ""As a global business consultancy we have been expanding our business in Asia for over 30 years and the region now represents a significant share of our total business. Alain and Philippe will leverage our global reach, European roots and large Asian presence to serve our clients in the region even better.”

Knut Storholm, Partner and Global Head of the Financial Services Competence Center at Roland Berger, adds, ""The financial services industry in the region is going to experience a massive transformation shaped by global trends and the differing development stages of each country. In their new role, Alain and Philippe will benefit from their longstanding experience of global markets and in-depth knowledge of the region to drive our teams and help our clients through this evolving landscape. We see plenty more opportunities in the region and this new setup reflects our commitment and ambition to grow with our local and global clients.”

The six month contract will see the management consultancies provide services such as financial analysis, business case simulation and support to the project office.

Jakarta is Indonesia’s most populated city at more than 10 million people. The city is facing the prospects of almost complete gridlock as population density and vehicle ownership increases. In a bid to ease traffic congestion, pollution and travel time, the Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit system (MRT) was signed into existence in 2010. The programme involves two lines and 13 stations. The first phase of the project connects the subdistrict Lebak Bulus to the Hotel Indonesia Roundabout, a central point in the city.

The contract for the development of Jakarta’s main central railway along the MRT route has gone to Roland Berger Tusk – JO, a joint venture between Roland Berger and Tusk Advisory, a regional strategic advisory firm with offices in Singapore and Indonesia. Over a period of six months the partners will oversee the financial side of the construction process.

Roland Berger has been tasked with assessing an internal study into the project, the development of a simulation and the running of financial projections, communicating between stakeholders and delivering benchmarking and analysis services. The value of the deal for the consulting firms is estimated to be around €300,000.

Although the EU has increased its ideological friction with China, European countries have maintained their enthusiasm for expanding economic cooperation with China. Nearly 60 percent of European companies plan to expand their businesses in China this year, an increase of nearly 10 percentage points from the 51 percent surveyed last year, a survey released by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China showed on Tuesday.After a rapid recovery from last year's epidemic, China has become a more important source of European economic growth and profit and European companies have increased their investment in the country.About half of the surveyed companies said that their profit margins in China are higher than the global average, which is much higher than the 38 percent in last year's survey.The study is made by the chamber, in cooperation with Roland Berger, to measure the confidence of European businesses in China. The annual survey was completed by 585 companies registered with the EU Chamber of Commerce.The report said the resilience of the Chinese market provides European companies with much needed shelter during the pandemic. As China quickly contained the COVID-19 outbreak at the beginning of last year, it became the driving force for global economy in 2020.The report said that 73 percent of the interviewed companies said they achieved profitability last year, while another 14 percent said they reached a brake-even point. About 68 percent of respondents are optimistic about the business prospects of their industry in the next two years, up from 48 percent last year.Approximately one quarter of the interviewed companies indicated that they are realizing the localization of their supply chains by moving their production lines to China or switching to suppliers that produce in China.Commitment to the China market remains strong with a mere 9 percent of respondents considering shifting any current or planned investment out of China, the lowest share on record according to the report.China-EU trade reached $250.3 billion in the first four months of this year, up 42 percent year-on-year. In the same period, the EU's actual investment in China reached $1.95 billion, an increase of 12.4 percent, while China's direct investment in the EU reached $1.69 billion, up 70.8 percent, according to data from the Ministry of Commerce.",['Global Times'],

https://www.consultancy.uk/news/13154/interview-roman-fernandez-senior-consultant-at-roland-berger,"Interview: Roman Fernandez, Senior Consultant at Roland Berger","Roman Fernandez, an MBA graduate of Spain-based IE Business School (2016 class), was bound to become an entrepreneur. Yet following graduation Fernandez picked the consulting industry, and last month he joined Roland Berger as a Senior Consultant in the firm’s Detroit office. Fernandez reflects on his decision to join consulting, the recruitment and job application process he has been through, why he joined Roland Berger and provides five key takeaways for aspiring management consultants.

Can you please tell us briefly what your previous job was about?

Before attending IE Business School, I worked as a product development engineer in the automotive industry for two major companies, Robert Bosch and Ford Motor Company. My role in engineering expanded over the years as I became a change agent for improving processes at both companies. I wrote and published several articles on improving the efficiency of the product development cycle as I gained more experience in operations management.

Has your personal career strategy always been focused on management consulting?

A: No. I left my job at Ford and attended the International MBA program at IE Business School to become an entrepreneur. However, while pursuing my entrepreneurship dream, I discovered the many overlapping attributes between entrepreneurship and management consulting. I realised that consulting firms are now embracing the entrepreneurial mindset to solve some of biggest challenges in the business world. An increasing number of big firms are being disrupted by small startups and lean business models. I loved problem solving just as much as creating new ideas for business. I was able to experience the excitement and challenge of consulting when I participated in and subsequently won the IE Oliver Wyman Consulting Case Competition in June 2016. I became an active member of the IE Consulting Club and engaged with other students who were pursuing opportunities in consulting. We practiced cases and shared our knowledge and ideas.

How did you find out about this job opportunity?

I researched many consulting firms and tried to identify those that fit my entrepreneurial mindset and relaxed personality. I networked with friends who worked in the consulting industry, made many new connections and gained valuable knowledge from them. I applied to several companies either through referrals or through their online career website. I discovered Roland Berger online when I stumbled upon insightful articles they published on the future transformation of the automotive industry. They were very entrepreneurial in their approach to solving problems and also had a relaxed work culture. I applied through their online career portal for a position at their Detroit office.

How was the recruiting process?

I interviewed with 3 consulting firms – A.T. Kearney, Oliver Wyman, and Roland Berger. I received my interview invitation from Oliver Wyman by networking with their firm in Madrid after the case competition last year. Though I did well in their interviews in July 2016, they decided to forward my application to their office in the US as the positions in Spain required fluent Spanish proficiency. I received interview invitations from both A.T. Kearney and Roland Berger through online job applications. I did not move forward after the second interview at A.T. Kearney in September 2016. I realised my approach in solving their interview case was a little too entrepreneurial and lacked the structure A.T. Kearney was looking for.

I decided to spend more time in refining my structure and practicing more cases with fellow students. By the time I appeared for my first round interview with Roland Berger in October 2016, I had already practiced over 70 cases with experts and other students. I had two interview rounds with Roland Berger over phone and Skype before they invited me to the final round of interviews at their office in Chicago in December 2016. The final round was 3 hours long. It started with a 45 minute behavioural fit interview followed by a 45 minute business knowledge interview. For my final case presentation, I was given a written case and 45 minutes of quiet time to prepare the case. I was not allowed to use PowerPoint slides and was asked to use traditional flipcharts and the white board to present my strategy and recommendations. Another 45 minutes were set aside for my case presentation and discussion which was attended by a senior partner and a senior consultant.

Can you share any tips or advice with students interested in applying to consulting firms?

On January 22nd, I was invited to share my success story with MBA students of the Consulting Club at IE. Instead, I chose to speak about my failures and the many lessons I learned from them. It made for a longer and insightful conversation, the kind that is rooted in my biggest lesson over the last year – you have to show them you care before you show them how smart you are. As a student from a school renowned for entrepreneurship, pursuing a career in consulting can be challenging. For those students/alumni who were not able to attend the session, here are 5 of the main takeaways from the conversation we had.

1. Networking is key – Most of us realise this late and then it’s too late. The best time to start networking is now, even before you craft your resume and cover letter (yes, ‘craft’ not just ‘prepare’). It takes time to build your network and the biggest reward you get from it is not referrals but the coaching and mentorship that helps you move forward. Remember: show up, step up and follow up, always!

2. Be authentic – There’s a beauty in not being the perfect fit. Your story is more compelling when it is authentic. Turn it into your personal brand and learn to pitch it to anyone at any time. Practice articulating why you want what you want.

3. Change the narrative – Your entrepreneurial background and lack of consulting experience is not a disadvantage. It is an asset, especially at a time when big companies are being disrupted by startups in their industries. The next few years will see more consultants becoming entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs becoming consultants. You can be one of them, either one.

4. Be prepared to fail – Most people don’t succeed because they give up when they fail. It is understandable. You look around and you see people’s successes on resumes, blogs, social media, television and in every conversation. But know this -behind every success is a string of many failures and a relentless attitude to keep moving forward. Don’t ever give up. Learn from your failures.

5. Involve others – Leverage your strengths to help people. Talk or write about what you know and let the world know your place in it. When the time comes to ask for help, don’t ‘ask’ instead ‘involve’ others in your mission. The strongest connections are always your peers and those that come after you. I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t believe in your dreams and aspirations. Actually I am fortunate I have an opportunity to help you. A couple years from today, when I’m struggling to get my next break in life, the one that reaches out a helping hand could be you!",[],2017-03-06 07:05:00+00:00
https://www.consultancy.asia/news/4772/apac-to-dominate-the-advanced-air-mobility-passenger-market,APAC to dominate the advanced air mobility passenger market,"Once only in the realms of science fiction, advanced air mobility is fast becoming a reality. And according to a study by Rolls-Royce and Roland Berger, the APAC region looks set to lead the pack.

The Asia Pacific region is poised to lead the world when it comes to passenger city aircraft and air taxis, according to a market forecast by global management consulting firm Roland Berger, which contends that APAC could account for more than half of all such operated aircraft and over 40 percent of global revenues by 2050.

By the end of this decade, the firm predicts that several thousand of these so-called vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft will be in operation across the region.

For its study, Roland Berger and Rolls-Royce looked at the passenger segment of the VTOL market, including three use cases for advanced air mobility; on-demand city taxi flights of up to 50 kilometres between any given landing stations; scheduled airport shuttles to various points of the city within a similar range; and scheduled intercity flights on defined routes ranging up to 250 kilometres away.

According to the consultancy’s projections, APAC could by 2050 have over 80,000 advanced air mobility aircraft in operation, or more than half of the world’s stock, with the Americas accounting for a third and Europe just a tenth of the pie.

Due to regional variations in the predominance of use types and differing price points, the Americas though would slightly pip APAC when it comes to revenues, the latter bringing in $37 billion in service revenues for a 41 percent share.

In the shorter term, Roland Berger predicts that some 7,000 passenger VTOLs could be in the world’s skies in less than ten years, with APAC again contributing around half of the global market.

Australia is unlikely to be a first-mover on the implementation side, and will ultimately see its fleet-size dwarfed by other Asian nations, it isn’t necessarily a laggard – with 120 passenger VTOLs expected to be airborne around the country by the end of the decade.

While a Deloitte report from just three years ago suggested the widespread use of passenger VTOLs could still be decades away – with regulatory frameworks, air traffic management, supporting infrastructure, and public safety just some of the hurdles that would need to be overcome alongside the technical challenge – Roland Berger believes these can be readily surmounted through ecosystem-wide partnerships and a sandbox approach to urban testing.

Proponents, like Roland Berger, also point to the array of benefits that commercial VTOL passenger networks would bring, including not in the least a reduced environmental footprint (the majority of VTOLs in development are electric, or eVTOLs) and the easing of roadway congestion. Other advantages include enhanced mobility safety and reliability, added convenience and connectivity, reduced noise pollution, and general time-saving for city commuters.",[],2022-03-30 05:01:00+00:00
https://www.consultancy.eu/news/5024/german-government-enlists-consultants-for-bafin-reform,German Government enlists consultants for BaFin reform,"The Federal Government of Germany has tasked consultants from Roland Berger, KPMG and Sopra Steria with assisting an overhaul of the nation’s financial watchdog BaFin. The regulator was recently accused of turning a blind eye to an accounting scandal that led to the collapse of German payment processor Wirecard.

The Finance Ministry has commissioned consultancies Roland Berger, KPMG and Sopra Steria to submit a report with reform recommendations by the end of November. Key to this is the Government’s aim of tightening the financial supervision of listed companies, which completely malfunctioned in the case of Germany’s former tech jewel but now bankrupt Wirecard.

Wirecard is a payment processor headquartered in Munich, Germany. The company offers its customers electronic payment transaction services and risk management, as well as the issuing and processing of physical cards. Allegations of accounting malpractices have trailed the company since the early days of its incorporation, reaching a peak in 2019 after the Financial Times revealed a series of investigations along with whistle-blower complaints and internal documents.

The situation peaked in June 2020, when auditor EY performed a u-turn on its work, and refused to sign off on Wirecard’s 2019 accounts, following months of investigation into missing €1.9 billion from its books. The move led to the sacking and arrest of then-Chief Executive Markus Braun, and the collapse of Wirecard.

Despite seemingly acting to defuse the mounting scrutiny it was facing, EY has continued to come under fire for signing off on Wirecard’s books for four years without flagging issues and failing to request crucial account information from a bank in Singapore which held up to €1 billion of Wirecard's cash – a state of affairs which has also piled pressure on Germany’s financial watchdog, BaFin.

In the summer, BaFin was sued by Wirecard investors who said the regulator turned a blind eye despite widespread evidence of an accounting scandal that led to the company’s collapse – a lawsuit which EY was later added to.

In an attempt to prevent a repeat of the Wirecard debacle, the team of consultants has been brought on board to help the Ministry overhaul the beleaguered ombudsman. German origin consultancy Roland Berger will lead the coalition of firms, cooperating with the legal wing of KPMG and Sopra Steria to develop specific recommendations for optimising the processes, the organisational structure and the resources at BaFin.

In addition to the consulting firms, representatives of the interests of auditors and the financial services industry, the administration of justice and science and, above all, civil society have also been asked to be involved.

According to Federal Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, the project should help pave the way for stricter rules for auditors and balance sheet control, as “the financial supervisory authority needs to have more power to control… We must not put the reforms on the back burner now.”

Considering the similarities between the Wirecard scandal and the series of accounting blunders which have placed the Big Four in the spotlight in the UK, however, Scholz’ choice to involve a number of consultancies in the process is sure to raise a few eyebrows itself. The British financial watchdog has come under increasing pressure to stop ‘conflicts’ between the audit and advisory wings of large consultancies like PwC, Deloitte, EY and KPMG inhibiting their accounting function, so the Government’s inclusion of one of these firms in particular is more than a little controversial.",[],2020-10-08 08:08:00+00:00

https://www.consultancy.uk/news/12222/roland-berger-truck-automation-may-stall-on-early-business-case,Roland Berger: Truck automation may stall on early business case,"The logistics of moving goods about with trucks may be open to a stepwise evolution towards full automation. The prospect of full automation, in which drivers are no longer required, is tantalising to the trucking industry owners whose major costs – outside CapEx – are fuel and drivers. Yet intervening stages come with significant investment costs and legal issues, which may put off rapid evolution in the market from the side of fleet operators and OEMs.

In a new report from Roland Berger, titled ‘Automated Trucks: The next big disruptor in the automotive industry?’, the consultancy considers the effect of different levels of automation on the trucking industry, as well as the key drivers holding off, and urging, market evolution.

Automation

The automation of trucks, according to the research, will undergo a number of stages. It starts with stage 0, the most basic stage, which has been the norm since the development of modern trucking – there is no automation. Stage 1, which already exists today, sees a number of driver-assisting technologies installed, including emergency breaking, adaptive cruise control, lane assists and driver assisted truck platooning. Stage 2, which introduces partial automation, is currently in pending implementation, and includes highway assist, predictive powertrain control, lane change assist, and intelligent parking assist – these technologies allow drivers to take their hands and feet off what have traditionally been key levers.

The next stage, stage 3, will see conditional automation in which the driver no longer has to be fully engaged with the process of operating the truck. Technologies like highway pilot, allow the driver to be fully disengaged but open to alerts, although they must need to be able to take control quickly if an unexpected situation arises. Stage 4 introduces the highway pilot, meaning that on long stretches the vehicle is completely in control of AI, with no responsibility to the driver for that period of the trip. In the final stage, stage 5, the truck is fully automated, and a driver as such is no longer required at all.

The different stages will, according to the analysis from the consultants, bring with them different implementation costs. Stage 1 involves around $1,800 per truck and involves a range of hardware and software installations, such as radar and sensor processing software. Stage 2 costs around $5,100, with additional hardware and software upgrades. Stage 3 would require an investment of around $6,200, and is the final stage in which hardware upgrades would be required. Stage 4 and 5 would cost an additional $5,900 and $4,400 respectively. The total cost for full automation, per truck, stands at $23,400 – 85% of which comes from software needs.

Scenarios

To better understand the cost of the upgrade, in relation to the various stages of automated driver development, the consultancy developed three different trucking scenarios. The different scenarios provide a range of conditions in which the specific value of the technologies can be better highlighted. The long haul scenario includes mainly highway travel, as well as plenty of opportunity for platooning. The short distance, high traffic roads scenario involves a shorter highway trip. The regional low traffic roads scenario considers the use of less frequented rural roads on which platooning is difficult to achieve.

Payback

The long haul example (stage 1) sees cost savings of around $1.700 per year, requiring 13 months for a return on the initial investment. Stage 2 would require more than three years for a return on investment, while stage 3 would require almost six. Stage 4, because of a reduction in driver costs, would see a return after 28 months, while the complete removal of the driver at stage 5 would see the investment returned within 4 months. For the regional high traffic highway situation, stages 2, 3 and 4 would all require more than three years for the investment to generate a return, while for the regional low traffic scenario, a return on investment for all stages is well above a 3 year period.

“The payback time for fleet operators strongly depends on the use case"", explains Walter Rentzsch, Senior Project Manager at Roland Berger who co-authored the study. “Trucks that operate on long-haul routes or regional trucks driving on trucking corridors can form platoons with ease and will see faster payback.""

Pressures

The payback period is relatively slow for two of the scenarios in which trucks are active, and given how far off full automation the technology is (15+ years), the pull for development of the technology is expected to be slow from both fleet operators and OEMs. OEMs are concerned about legal conditions surrounding the technology, while some OEMs may baulk at the costs. Yet, besides cost benefits to fleet operators and the legalese surrounding on road regulation, the technology also has the capacity to significantly improve safety on the road.

Stephan Keese, Senior Partner and responsible for Roland Berger’s Americas Commercial Vehicle practice, concludes ""The technology will be available well before the trucking industry will embrace it. A legal framework needs to provide stability for an industry that will be significantly reshaped in the way we operate trucks today.""",[],2016-07-07 06:06:00+00:00

Looks like Thailand and Indonesia are gearing to become Electric Vehicles' (EV) ecosystem hubs in Southeast Asia.

According to Roland Berger's findings, released in the management consultancy's 10th edition Automotive Disruption Radar (ADR) study, both country's governments have showed commitment towards EVs via policies.

The interest among both country's citizens have also been a factor.

Like it or not, EVs are coming. IMAGE: Quartz

At the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha had reiterated the Southeast Asian country's goal to enable 50 percent of vehicles produced in Thailand to be Zero-Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) by the end of this decade.

By 2035, the country aims to hit 100 percent in line with the Thai government's National Electric Vehicle Policy Committee's ambitious target.

Due to this, Thailand is buzzing with investors and business people who're interested to take advantage of the country's pro-EV policies.

Taiwanese electronics firm Foxconn recently announced plans to produce up to 200,000 EVs in the country annually in partnership with Thai-based gas and petroleum company, PTT Public Company Limited. The project is slated to begin sometime between 2023 and 2024.

Meanwhile, Indonesia announced a national strategy to manufacture 2.2 million electric cars and 13 million electric bikes. All of them are expected to hit Indonesian streets by 2030.

Investors are already pouring in with Hyundai Motor and LG Energy Solutions investing US$1 billion to a battery cell manufacturing site with 10 GWh capacity in Karawang.

With Indonesia rich in raw material resources, specifically nickel, to build EVs, the plant will open its doors in the first half of 2024.

Meanwhile, Gojek and Gogoro partnered up with Pertamina to produce 250 electric scooters in Jakarta, with an eventual scale of up to 5000 units.

""Keen industry interest and activities are a clear signal that Thailand and Indonesia would be very interesting to watch in their journey towards automotive and transportation electrification and transformation,"" said Roland Berger South East Asia Partner, Udomkiat Bunworasate.

Are Thais and Indonesians into EVs because of the environment?

Lack of EV charging stations is slowing the vechicle's uptake. IMAGE: PR Newswire.

According to Roland Berger's findings, most people are interested in EVs because they're efficient.

Demand for EVs in Indonesia is on the rise due to the fact that many Indonesians travel short distance, making these vehicles viable options.

In Thailand, 80 percent of respondents showed interested to purchase a battery EV as their next car. In Indonesia, it's 75 percent.

Action for the environment, however, comes second.

However, there are key concerns and this has mainly to do with the high price tags of the EV compared to their primitive cousins, the internal combustion engine (ICE) cars i.e. the ones you're most likely driving now.

The limited availability of charging stations is another factor that makes many Indonesians and Thai reconsider their decision to purchase EVs.

""On the supply side, key EV ecosystem players such as OEMs, parts suppliers, charging infrastructure operators are weighing investment risks and long-term business viability due to current low demand volume.

""Much still needs to be done by policymakers, industry stakeholders to jointly address current pain points and put in place necessary enablers to stimulate and accelerate EV growth in Indonesia,"" Roland Berger South East Asia Principal Timothy Wong said.

As the startup scene continues to grow across the globe, professional services firms have become key bridges between industry players and startup hubs. To support its global client base and find promising talent and propositions within Lisbon’s startup scene, Roland Berger recently announced a partnership with Startup Lisboa.

The development of a budding startup arena, in a large part ushered in by technological advance, has provided a backdrop for the creation of high impact, high value companies within a relatively short time-frame. While most startups do not make it to unicorn status, many that survive the first tentative years are able to create considerable value for themselves as well as their clients and customers.

The startup community is being supported by a range of actors and entities. Venture capitalists and angel investors provide much of the financial backing to the industry. Cities and government enact a range of policies to support startups and eventual scaleups. Professional services firms too have become more and more involved in the industry in recent years, providing not merely critical intelligence and advice surrounding markets and the product development, but also opening up their wider networks in which startups can be better matched with potential clients at various critical stages in their development. For this purpose, among others, professional services firms have supported the development of startup hubs, accelerators and incubators across the globe, including KPMG’s Ignition Centre, FIS' FinTech centre, and Capgemini’s Codebase partnership, to name a few.



Lisbon is one of the globe’s 35 best cities for digital entrepreneurs & innovation, Portugal's capital takes the 17th spot. The city provides a friendly business environment, strong digital and non-digital infrastructure and an amiable lifestyle. Among the organisations in the city that supports startups is Startup Lisboa. The organisation, which was founded in 2011 by the Lisbon Municipality, Bank Montepio and IAPMEI, supports and tracks startups throughout their first year of development within the city. The organisation provides startups with access to office space as well as a wide ranging support structure, which includes mentoring, access to investors, business basics support, networking activities and strategic partner access.



The partnership between Startup Lisboa and Roland Berger focuses on supporting industry incumbents – such as banking, insurance, specialised retail and healthcare sectors – with access to disruptive and fast-growth solutions within the Lisbon startup scene, boosting the business potential of startups and creating a means for incumbents to partner or acquirer disruptive innovations. Solutions are focused on the development of new business models as well as technologies to support them.

As part of the deal, Roland Berger will provide consulting support to startups in the form of exubation, whereby incumbents and startups work together to develop disruptive solutions; digital ecosystem, organise shared initiatives between Startup Lisboa and Roland Berger; a digital think tank, which focuses on shared knowledge on digital innovation cantered in the city of Lisbon through publications and workshops, hosting of workshops and shared events together with startups and large corporates. In addition, the partnership taps into Roland Berger’s global Terra Numerata network, providing access for global corporates into the Lisbon startup scene as well as global exposure for innovative solutions being developed under the guidance of Startup Lesboa to international players.

António Bernardo, Managing Partner of Roland Berger and Member of the Global Executive Committee, sees the partnership ""as a historic landmark for the Portuguese digital ecosystem that enables a synergistic combination of business experience from our consultants and the entrepreneurial and innovation competencies that are embedded in Startup Lisboa.”

https://www.consultancy.uk/news/2432/roland-berger-supports-myanmar-with-economic-hub,Roland Berger supports Myanmar with economic hub,"To boost their international competitiveness, the governments of Myanmar and Thailand have recently joined forces and launched an ambitious plan to develop a new business hub. The development of the so-called Dawei Special Economic Zone is realised with funding of several private developers, and supported by management consultants from Roland Berger.

Last week, on August 5, the Myanmar government and a consortium of private developers signed a concession agreement regarding the Dawei Special Economic Zone (Dawei SEZ) initial phase development*. The launch of the programme marks a significant milestone in Myanmar's economic development – the zone is expected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the long-term and contribute up to 5% of Myanmar's GDP by 2045. If all goes according to plan, the initiators believe Dawei SEZ could even become one of the largest special economic zones in the world, leveraging its strategic position in the center of South-East Asia. The hub provides access to the Andaman Sea to the west, proximity to Bangkok and Thailand's Eastern Seaboard and further beyond, to Cambodia and Vietnam.

In preparing for the initial phase development the initiators commissioned Roland Berger to guide the process. The consultants in addition supported the development of the long-term master plan of Dawei SEZ, in doing so collaborating with officials and a wide range of related ministries from both countries on a daily basis. The decision to hire Roland Berger as an external advisor builds on previous engagements the firm supported in Myanmar. In 2013, the German-origin advisory was engaged by the country’s government to advise and manage the international tender process for two new telecom licenses. The consulting firm has also advised the Central Bank of Myanmar in the tender process for international banking licenses in 2014-2015.

The first phase in the process involves the construction of a small port, power plants, a two-lane road to Thailand, an LNG terminal, an initial township, a telecom landline and an industrial estate focusing on labour-intensive industries. While the initial phase development will target labour-intensive industries such as textile and garments and food processing, the long-term master plan will attract other industries to Dawei SEZ as well. These industries include automotive, steel, electronics and electric goods, rubber, metals, chemicals, refinery, fertilizers, plastics and pharmaceuticals.

""Eventually, the zone will have a deep seaport as well as a highway to Thailand,"" says Damien Dujacquier, Partner at Roland Berger. ""The aim is to create a regionally-integrated, world-class and export-focused special economic zone."" He adds that Dawei SEZ would be developed in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner, in line with international practices.

""Investors will be attracted by its strategic location, competitive labour costs and import duty exemptions to key export markets such as the European Union. Additionally, an investor-friendly SEZ legal framework, as well as strong growth of the overall Myanmar economy and the abundance of certain local resources will also buoy interest from the business community,"" Dujacquier comments.

In the coming months, advisors from Roland Berger will continue to assist the Myanmar and Thai governments on the further development and roll-out of the programme.

https://www.consultancy.uk/news/3142/improved-execution-of-megaprojects-could-save-trillions,Improved execution of megaprojects could save trillions,"Megaprojects are notoriously hard to manage, and up to 90% end up being over time and budget, research by Roland Berger finds. As the number of megaprojects is set to increase, up to €30 - €75 trillion will be invested in such projects over the coming 15 years, finding ways to limit costs will become a strategic necessity. According to the consultancy, a way to prevent these overruns is by implementing a strategic unit, the ‘executive intelligence office’, that is able to cope with the most common causes of overruns.

Megaprojects, those projects that cost more than $1 billion, tend to be technically complex, multi-year and multi-stakeholder projects. Many of these kinds of projects are infrastructure-based, including airports, pipelines, refineries, roads and rail infrastructure to high-speed trains, aircrafts and IT systems. Examples of recent megaprojects include the Trans-Adriatic gas pipeline, the expansion of the Suez and Panama Canals, the implementation of a new rail safety system in Europe, and Beijing's, Istanbul's and Rio de Janeiro's new international airports.

Due to their size and complexity, megaprojects tend to overrun their original budgets. In a recent report, titled ‘Keep your megaproject on track’, Roland Berger analyses more than 1,000 megaprojects in terms of financial and schedule planning and their resultant trajectories. The consulting firm finds that 90% of the projects have gone over budget and timelines. The average cost overrun for the projects is 55% of the original budget – and for many, the actual costs exceed the original business case by a factor of two, three or more.

The number of megaprojects on the books is expected to increase in the coming years as long overdue infrastructure upgrades and redevelopments, as well as emerging economic infrastructure projects, are implemented. According to an analysis by Arcadis an additional $84 trillion in new infrastructure wealth will be created between now and 2025, with megaprojects expected to come in at around €30-75 trillion over the coming 15 years.

The cost and timeline overruns are costing project backers considerable, often unplanned, business expenses. In a bid to reduce the loss of time and money, Roland Berger investigated a number of ways in which project management can be improved across the whole project.

Project overruns

The analysis isolates four major factors that influence project costs. These include the inherent complexity of projects, where the long timetables and great number of interfaces make them difficult to manage. The second is the new ground deployed in the projects, technologies are sometimes developed for the project and are therefore as yet untested on a large scale, forcing constant recalibration as unforeseen issues arise. The dynamics that come from a wide range of shareholders taking part in the project, with the goal posts moving as conditions are changed, and conflicts of interests arise are also seen as a factor. The final problem faced by many large scale projects is the simple complexity of the mega scale and the unpredictability of every eventuality.

Moulding mega reality

To manage megaprojects a wide range of tool sets and models have been developed in recent years, including stage gates, front-end loading, the Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT), Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), the Project Management Body of Knowledge Guide, Projects IN Controlled Environments (PRINCE 1 and 2). According to the firm, these systems help reduce the length and depth of overruns, yet are not in themselves sufficient to deal with the managerial complexity of such large projects. The project managers with oversight tend to become auditors rather than controllers of the project’s destiny.

The key ingredient missing, according to the Roland Berger, is a means of making rapid contextualised decisions in the face of a constantly changing environment. In an ideal world for management, all relevant information is constantly available and decisions regarding that information can be seamlessly made in line with project goals. Since we tend to find ourselves in environments that lack description, managers find themselves needing to make decisions from more limited data, with short timeframes. Given the nature of the environment, the consultancy suggests setting up an executive intelligence office to ensure Rapid and Appropriate Decisions with Accurate Response (RADAR).

The purpose of this unit is to provide more than just managerial oversight and audit of the wider project, focusing instead also on strategic and fast limited information processing with accurate judgement built from a wide range of sources. “It focuses on helping steer the project by identifying and enabling decisions within the context of the ever-changing reality […] The RADAR is tailored to the specific needs and situation of the megaproject at hand.” the report states. The benefits of such oversight within mega projects could be staggering, given the €30 - €75 trillion to be invested; even a 10% better outcome in costs would net €3.0 - €7.5 trillion in savings.",[],2016-01-11 00:00:00+00:00
https://www.consultancy.uk/news/2473/roland-berger-seeks-steel-plant-site-in-dharwad-india,"Roland Berger seeks steel plant site in Dharwad, India","As part of its further expansion, the global steel titan Arcelor-Mittal has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Steel Authority of India to construct a ‘Cold Rolling Mill Downstream Finishing Facility’. Roland Berger, Arcelor-Mittal’s technical advisor, is on the lookout for a suitable location for the new plant, which will have a production capacity of 1.5 lakh tonnes (150,000 tons) and cost Rs 5,000 crore ($782 million).

In a bid to find a site for the giant steel plant, Prathamesh Choudhary and Juben Sarkar from strategy consulting firm Roland Berger – contacted the Karnataka Chamber of Commerce andâ€ˆIndustry (KCCI) to find a suitable location in the vast Indian landscape that provides both the infrastructure needs as well as proximity to an automotive cluster that represents demand.

“For setting up the steel plant, Arcelor-Mittal requires 300 acres of land in a rectangular shape. We have informed the consultancy about the availability of land belonging to the KIADB near Mummigatti in Dharwad and at Gamanagatti Industrial Area second stage near Hubballi,” states Vasant Ladawa, KCCIâ€ˆPresident.

Although the around 1.3 km by 0.7 km piece of land required for the project is potentially available – in the vicinity of Tata Motors, Tata Marcopolo, Tata Telcon and various small automotive companies – several issues remain surrounding the government’s commitment to introducing heavy industry to the area. As it stands, the local government has delayed providing information about the land availability, soil strength, and water quality, among others.

“We urged the government to take the issue seriously and to ensure there’s no repetition of the case of Hero Motocorp, which we lost. This steel plant will boost the development of the Mumbai-Karnataka region. The Chief Minister has instructed Industries andâ€ˆCommerce Department Commissioner Gourav Gupta to take suitable steps,” adds Ladawa.

Chief Minister and Industries Minister state however, that one of the reasons for a delayed response appears to be that the no proposal for setting up the plant in the Dharwad region has been received. Even though no such formal proposal has been received, the local government has been informed according to Ladawa: “A KCCI delegation met Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and District in-charge Minister Dinesh Gundu Rao in Bengaluru on June 24 to apprise them of the matter. Additional Chief Secretary (Industries) Ratnaprabha K. too was apprised of it. During the Belagavi session, we met Mr. Gundu Rao again to stress the need for taking forward the process.”

The breakdown of communications has led to a ‘communications gap’ with as a result, a continued concern that – with no informal interest shown – the project might be moved to another region unless all parties are able to bring themselves to the same page and formally investigate the merits and disadvantages of such a project for the region.",[],2015-08-27 00:00:00+00:00

Indeed, PwC renounced to the audit in August 2017.

This audit mission will be haunted by the comments of Ahmad Ahmad, the acting chairman of CAF, who said in August 2017, during a visit in Burkina Faso, that Cameroon was not ready to host the biggest football event in Africa.

At the time, his comments generated a wave of protests in Cameroon who interpreted them as a will to trust the organization of AFCON 2019 to Morocco instead of Cameroon; this as a revenge for his country’s suspension as the host of an Africa U-20 Cup of Nations when Issa Hayatou, a Cameroonian, was chairing the executive committee of CAF.

Thomas Sedran (51) joins Volkswagen from car manufacturer General Motors (GM), the American parent of Opel. In 2012, when he started his employment at the firm, he was named head of Strategy & Operations for Opel, and later on he served as interim CEO, playing a key role in developing the ‘Drive Opel 2022’ strategy designed to return the company to profitability. Over the past two and a half years Sedran was President and Managing Director of Chevrolet and Cadillac Europe.

The reason for their stay after passing through Gabon, Congo and Equatorial Guinea, revealed during a press conference held in Douala on September 12, 2015, is to collect data from various economic operators in the frame of a study of the financial market’s potential in the CEMAC.

Asides unlocking the potential of the two most competitive stock markets in the CEMAC, namely the Bvmac in Libreville and the Dsx in Douala, this study carried out by the Cosumaf and financed by the World Bank aims to draw out a diagnosis covering the 15-years history of the CEMAC’s financial market, and provide recommendations on a roadmap which will boost market activity in the community.

To this end, Georges Ferré, a consultant from Roland Berger, said the experts’ team intends to visit Morocco and the Southeast of Asia, to learn from their individual experience in terms of stock markets. Indeed, at a point in time, the economies of these two countries were quite similar to that of the CEMAC now, but succeeded in developing highly efficient financial markets.

However, it should be recalled that, in almost 15 years, the financial market still stalls to take off in the CEMAC (Cameroon, Gabon, Congo, Chad, RCA and Equatorial Guinea), where businesses have difficulties in obtaining funding to grow. In Douala and Librevillle for example, only about six businesses are listed, and the two stock exchanges are mainly fueled by the various bonds issued by the governments and institutions such as the BDEAC and the SFI.

According to experts, the lack of market culture, the high costs of services, the lack of transparency and the bad governance characterizing businesses in the region, are the main reasons for the populations’ disinterest in the financial market within the CEMAC.

https://www.consultancy.uk/news/2851/the-25-best-consulting-firms-to-work-for-in-europe,The 25 best consulting firms to work for in Europe,"McKinsey & Company, Bain & Company, Oliver Wyman, Roland Berger and A.T. Kearney are according to consultants in the industry the best consulting firms to work for in Europe.

Since 2009, Vault, a global career intelligence platform, conducts research into good employership in the consulting industry. The European edition of the study, titled ‘Vault Consulting Europe’, presents the 25 best consulting firms to work for in Europe, and is based on the views of almost 3,000 strategy and management consultants working at reputable firms across the continent. In order to judge a firm’s status as an employer, consultancies were evaluated across seven dimensions*. When rating quality of life issues, advisors were only allowed to rate their own firm, while for the prestige dimension consultants were only permitted to rate their competitors.





Similar to last year’s edition, McKinsey & Company tops the list, building mainly on its top of the bill compensation packages, high employee satisfaction and an unmatched prestige score, a feat where it consistently outranks its peers. The New York based firm, founded in 1926, has been named Europe’s most prestigious consultancy every year since the launch of the research in 2010, a performance also realised in the global version of the rankings. Bain & Company holds second spot, across the board with a similar profile as McKinsey, scoring high on prestige, with the Boston headquartered firm in particular admired for the strategic and high-level impact of engagements and for its fast progression and friendly culture.

The third of the Big 3 American strategy consultancies, The Boston Consulting Group, finds itself in on #23 this year, its lowest position since 2010, when it ranked #2 – between 2011 and last year the strategy advisory hovered between positions 15 and 21. From an employership perspective, BCG’s European operations lag behind the firm’s global score – BCG has ranked in the top 3 best firms to work for consistently since 2010 while in another ranking BCG was even named the globe’s best consulting firm to work for – the researchers however not elaborating on the key reasons. What is clear is that it has nothing to do with reputation: in line with the 2014 edition, BCG is ranked the #2 most reputable firm in Europe after McKinsey.

The top five is completed by Oliver Wyman – the management consultancy unit of professional services giant Marsh & McLennan Companies – Roland Berger (the highest ranked European origin consultancy on the list) and A.T. Kearney. All three have gained terrain this year; Oliver Wyman thanks to among others its industry leading Financial Services practice and strong growth in Europe, while Roland Berger has advanced both its prestige and employee satisfaction on the back of a new ambitious growth strategy, a rebranding and the clear-cut decision to proceed as an independent player. A.T. Kearney has gradually moved up the rankings over the years, from #8 in 2010 to #5 this year, reflecting the continued growth booked under the leadership of Dutchman Johan Aurik and his predecessor Paul Laudicina, as well as its growing investment in employee and diversity friendly HR policies and programmes, such as the recently launched Encore initiative.

The positions 6 to 10 are taken by OC&C Strategy Consultants, Strategy& (the former Booz & Company, now the strategy unit of PwC), Frontier Economics (with around 200 professionals one of the largest specialised economics consultancies in Europe), Arthur D. Little – generally recognised as the globe’s first management consultancy** – and German origin sales & marketing specialist Simon-Kucher & Partners, one of the fastest growing players in the industry.

Number 11 on the list is QVARTZ, a Nordic-based management consulting firm founded in 2002 with offices in Copenhagen, Olso and Stockholm. The Brattle Group, a US advisory firm that specialises in economic and financial topics is found on the twelfth spot, followed by retail expert Javelin Group (acquired by Accenture in May this year). All three have entered the top 25 this year, with Schlumberger Business Consulting the fourth new entrant, an achievement which it won’t repeat next year – the consulting unit of the oil & gas giant was bought by Accenture two months ago.

The top 20 of the Vault Consulting Europe ranking further boasts well-known consultancies such as L.E.K. Consulting (founded in 1983 by three partners from Bain & Company), Alvarez & Marsal (renowned for its cutting-edge restructuring and financial advisory services), Charles River Associates (including its management consulting unit Marakon) and Sia Partners, a French origin consulting firm that off late has expanded rapidly, while a recently unveiled strategy aims to further propel the firm up the ranks towards the traditional big guns. Two London-based boutique management consultancies also find themselves in the top 20: Candesic (#14) and CIL Management Consultants (#20).

Also NERA Economic Consulting, the economic advisory unit of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Cognizant, and the consulting practices of PwC (‘PwC Advisory’) and Deloitte (‘Deloitte Consulting’) belong to the best consulting firms to work for in Europe.

https://www.consultancy.uk/news/3126/european-truck-oems-compete-for-aftersales-market,European truck OEMs compete for aftersales market,"The European truck aftersales market is extremely profitable, and has traditionally been in the hands of OEMs. Changes are afoot however, as technology and new players are seeking to service customers’ needs more efficiently than OEMs, cutting into margins and market share. In a recent Roland Berger report, the consultancy considers two ways for OEMs to continue to stay competitive: delivering a strong base service, and innovating ways of improving services for the future market.

The European truck aftersales market represents the most profitable business segment for truck OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). The market, made up of customer service, maintenance and spare parts, has seen increased competition in recent years as more and more suppliers, wholesalers, workshops and players from outside the industry try to break into the market with new business models.

To explore the changing trend, and increased competition faced by OEMs, Roland Berger released a report titled ‘European truck aftersales 2030 – Securing the most profitable business’. The report also considers ways in which OEMs can improve their competitiveness and thereby hold onto their customers and their profits. For the report, the consulting firm engaged a wide range of industrial experts from some of the largest players.

Aftersales

Aftersales tend to contribute only a small amount of revenue compared to the sale of new trucks, the gross margin for the segments are widely divergent however. For the sale of the base truck, unit margins are between 0% and 5%, while for the aftersales this ranges between 25% and 50%. “Gross margins on spare parts, maintenance and service can be as high as 50%,” explains Norbert Dressler, Partner at Roland Berger. “The OEMs simply cannot afford to pass that up. That’s why they must act in response to the new competitive context, and they must act now.”

The margins are under pressure from a number of changes within the market however. One of which is the digitisation of the maintenance and repair processes. Further, total transparency will put margins under ever greater pressure, and the rise of new processes, such as service factories, may lead to the replacement of today’s workshop landscape. In addition, emerging disruptive technologies, such as autonomous trucks, offer very high safety standards, reducing crash repair requirements and thereby impacting parts & service sales and insurance products.

Changes in the lay of the land from technology advances are only one area of concern for OEMs; there is also increased competition within the market as more and more players are entering to make a cut. Customers with large truck fleets place considerable importance on their fleets being on the road. Fast repair turnaround is therefore key, something competitors may be able to better deliver through changing business models and market access.

Competition

Suppliers are gaining business relevance driven by forward integration and access to the customer interface, as they are able to bundle their know-how in independent workshop systems and offer a premium, one-stop service on a 24/7 basis for a wide variety of makes and models. Independent wholesalers, on the other hand, are gaining power from consolidation, as they bundle their purchasing power and set up their own workshop concepts supported by private equity. Lastly, independent workshops are becoming genuine competitors to OEMs due to their strong flexibility and fair value repairs.

“All of these players have different business models despite operating in the same market,” comments Dressler. “So what OEMs need to do is develop a comprehensive portfolio of services to optimally cover the individual customer needs. That is the only way for OEMs to defend their share of the aftersales market.”

To meet these challenges the consultancy notes two key areas for OEM players: doing things right and innovating to do more.

The first key area is improving the base-line offering. OEMs must structure their services in such way that they enable them to compete with the products and services offered by suppliers, wholesalers and workshops. According to the firm, it involves five success factors along the distribution chain:

Offer a broad spectrum of spare parts in different price categories to address even price-sensitive customers;

Use connected assistance systems as standard to support both fleet operators and truck drivers;

Understand the lifecycle of a truck and the requirements of the market to enable competitive pricing;

Optimise spare parts logistics to trim process times in the workshop and keep downtime to a minimum;

Offer customer demand oriented all-in-one services 24 hours a day.

In addition, innovation will be required for OEMs to ensure that their baseline service meets customers’ needs and expectations. Philipp Grosse Kleimann, Partner at Roland Berger, notes that increased technological development will need to be met with improved digital offerings. Data-based based technologies will enable vehicles, and even entire truck fleets, to communicate with drivers, OEMs and workshops directly, to allow for the potentially lean and waste-less delivery of services. This will improve efficiency for both customers and OEMs. “The key factor distinguishing between rivals in the aftersales business will no longer be the brand name. It will be the efficiency of the products and processes they offer,” adds Kleimann. “OEMs need to position themselves correspondingly.”",[],2016-01-21 00:00:00+00:00

Married to a former journalist, Berger is more accessible to reporters than most German consultants and last year appeared on the cover of manager magazin, a top German publication. A common complaint among competing consultants is that Berger's promotion of his personal brand forces them to be more publicity conscious -- and that can take the spotlight off clients.

Berger's celebrity status -- he once commissioned a portrait of himself by Andy Warhol -- means, however, that few refuse his phone calls. Disarmingly low-key, he's a confidant to the likes of Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann and Siemens CEO Peter Löscher. Berger enjoys bringing people together and mediating conflicts, often over a good bottle of wine. ""He genuinely wants to help unlock a difficult situation.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/14/the-hydrogen-stream-lcoh-of-subsidized-green-hydrogen-under-2-kg/,The Hydrogen Stream: LCOH of subsidized green hydrogen under $2/kg,"Subsidized hydrogen produced via electrolysis from renewable (green) or nuclear power (pink) can reach levelized production costs under $2/kg in the United States. “Fully depreciated operating nuclear plants yield higher capacity factors and, when only accounting for operating expenses, pink hydrogen can reach production levels lower than green hydrogen,” said Lazard and Roland Berger in a new study. The LCOE report then analyses the levelized cost of green and pink hydrogen using PEM and alkaline electrolyzers under unsubsidized and subsidized scenarios. LCOH for green hydrogen with PEM electrolyzers goes from $0.48 to $1.81 with subsidies and is in the range of $2.75 to $4.08 without subsidies. LCOH for green hydrogen with alkaline electrolyzers goes from $1.16 to $2.99 with subsidies and is in the range of $3.47 to $5.29 without subsidies. LCOH for pink hydrogen with PEM electrolyzers goes from $0.83 to $2.83 with subsidies and is in the range of $3.79 to $5.78 without subsidies. LCOH for pink hydrogen with alkaline electrolyzers goes from $1.68 to $4.28 with subsidies and is in the range of $4.77 to $7.37 without subsidies. The report also explained that “while hydrogen-ready natural gas turbines are still being tested, preliminary results, including our illustrative LCOH analysis, indicate that a 25% hydrogen by volume blend is feasible and cost competitive.”

The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has announced AUD 50 million ($34 million) for two funding rounds targeting research and development for renewable hydrogen and low-emission iron and steel. “Funding for successful research and development projects will be provided over two phases, with an initial laboratory-based research phase followed by a commercialization phase aimed at scaling up and demonstrating research breakthroughs,” said ARENA. AUD 25 million will be allocated to each of the funding rounds, with grant funding for successful applicants expected to range between AUD 500,000 and AUD 5 million.

Australia is facing competition in the hydrogen race from other countries that have stimulated their industries through subsidies. Australia is now seeking to create an enabling investment environment through the provision of enhanced regulatory certainty and the development of a domestic hydrogen guarantee of origin scheme as well as grants, incentives, and access to lower interest financing via the Clean Energy Finance Corporation's AUD 300 million ($202 million) Advancing Hydrogen Fund. “Australia’s announced pipeline of over 100 hydrogen projects is worth around AUD 230-300 billion of potential investment. This represents close to 40% of all global clean hydrogen project announcements, and underlines Australia’s potential to be among the global leaders,” said Chris Bowen, Australia’s minister for Climate Change and Energy, in the State of Hydrogen 2022 publication. The report explains that, as of December 2022, only one project with a 10 MW capacity or higher has passed FID from this pipeline of investment.

CHICAGO / ACCESSWIRE / April 12, 2023 / The U.S. manufacturing sector is experiencing disruptive change, and manufacturing leaders are moving exponentially faster and juggling more priorities than ever before. Among the most important issues impacting their operations, manufacturers rank digitalization and sustainability as top priorities. In the wake of supply chain challenges, and market preferences, among other factors, more companies are pursuing localization and reshoring to the Americas. Furthermore, as the pace of disruption has become the new benchmark for change in the manufacturing industry, leading-edge manufacturers continue to strategically invest and move forward. These are among the key findings in the new report by the Manufacturers Alliance Foundation and Roland Berger, ""Manufacturers Disrupting Themselves: Increased Competitiveness and Resiliency Through Next Generation Manufacturing.""

Manufacturers Alliance and Roland Berger conducted interviews and surveys with C-level leaders from dozens of manufacturing companies, primarily located in North America, in Q1 of this year. Survey respondents included subject matter experts in finance, strategy, and manufacturing operations.

""Now more than ever, manufacturers are recognizing that in order to move the needle, they must embrace next generation manufacturing trends, and proactively develop a pragmatic set of solutions that address today's global challenges,"" said Michelle Drew Rodriguez, Partner, Roland Berger. ""Through the report developed by Roland Berger and Manufacturers Alliance, our goal is to provide insights on how leading next-gen manufacturers are prioritizing and already activating each of these trends in their go-forward strategies, as well as how their best practices can help create a roadmap for other manufacturers looking to increase their own competitiveness and resiliency.""

Manufacturers Alliance Foundation President and CEO Stephen Gold noted, ""While manufacturing has faced years of disruption through a global pandemic, supply chain crisis, and threat of an economic downturn, to name a few, the pace of change continues to accelerate. Successful manufacturers continue to face these headwinds with innovation and an eye on long-term growth. This report highlights six megatrends manufacturing executives ignore at their own peril.""

Among the Key Findings in the Report:

Business model innovation has come to manufacturing

Following in the footsteps of other sectors, manufacturing is increasingly looking at business model innovation instead of strictly focusing on product innovation. Additional sources of growth include new solutions, differentiation through software, and novel services.

Digitalization is table stakes for competitiveness, and a prerequisite for sustainability

After many years of taking a 'wait-and-see' approach to digitalization, companies now realize digitalization is essential for them to succeed. Companies now rank digitalization (76%) and sustainability (72%) as the most relevant and important trends. There has been considerable investment uptick in both over the last two years, and manufacturers are investing and making progress in both areas with long-term goals in mind. The daunting nature of handling these two massive trends has been replaced by the realization that, when done right, they solve each other.

Reshoring and localization are gaining traction (and becoming a competitive advantage)

After decades of outsourcing, the idea of locating manufacturing within the market it serves is taking on new importance in wake of surging transportation costs, trade wars, geopolitical risk, the accelerated pace of climate events, and broken supply chains. More companies are pursuing or considering localization and reshoring; the U.S., Canada, and Mexico topped the list for intended destination for manufacturers surveyed. Among survey respondents, 52% stated they are implementing or expanding localization initiatives, and another 22% said they were piloting initiatives (with others limiting relocation to specific functions or products). A whopping 52% of manufacturers surveyed plan to build new facilities as part of their relocation strategy.

Technology leaders are much more likely to pursue lot-size-one or individualized manufacturing

Many manufacturers are pursuing local-for-local strategy based not only on the difficulty and cost of shipping a large product, but also because of local market preferences and the demand for specific functions.

Digitalization is playing an important role in the ability to deliver customized products, as well as the development of new products, solutions, and services. Customization initiatives and pilots are already being planned or are underway or expanding at 78% of companies; 34% of them are pursuing fully individualized manufacturing approaches, with the goal of lot-size-one (producing a single item) - the exact opposite of traditional mass production. Among companies that consider themselves to be early adapters, 54% are pursuing individualized manufacturing.

https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japans-crackdown-truck-driver-overtime-raises-fears-economic-breakdown-2023-04-06/,Japan's crackdown on truck driver overtime raises fears of economic breakdown,"[1/5] Delivery trucks are parked at a parking area along the highway in Chiba, east of Tokyo, Japan April 6, 2023. REUTERS/Issei Kato















TOKYO, April 7 (Reuters) - Truck driver Yuichi Tomita has been delivering packages all over Japan for two decades, often clocking 40 straight hours on the road. He says the work is tough but a source of pride, and one he's never thought of quitting - until now.

On April 1, 2024, the government will limit truck drivers' annual overtime to 960 hours, among other reforms officials say are meant to improve the job's notoriously gruelling conditions and make it more attractive.

Drivers such as Tomita say the law will instead lead to an exodus from an occupation where most need those extra hours to pay the bills.

That has sparked fears of what those in retail and logistics call the ""2024 crisis"": a critical shortage of truck drivers that, if unaddressed, could leave a third of all cargo undelivered and result in a potential 10 trillion yen ($76 billion) hit to the world's third-largest economy by 2030, by government estimates.

""I've been doing this job for 20 years and you just can't make ends meet on base pay alone,"" said Tomita, a second-generation trucker and father of a 3-year-old. ""I really think this crisis is going to threaten Japan's economy and families like ours.""

Drivers make 4.46 million yen ($34,000) a year on average. That is about 10% below the average for all industries despite working 20% longer hours.

An expected drop-off in the number of truck drivers would set off a domino effect for farmers, shops and diners accustomed to next-day delivery of fresh fish and crisp produce.

The global consultancy Roland Berger expects a 20% decline in the number of Japanese truck drivers in the decade to 2030.

""Simply put, people in Tokyo will have no means to get fresh vegetables or fish from Kyushu (in southern Japan) and other far-off regions,"" said Masashi Onozuka, a partner at consultancy

Roland Berger who serves on the government's study group for

sustainable logistics systems. ""That could affect consumer spending and other areas too.""

SQUEEZED

About 98% of Japan's 62,000 trucking companies - responsible for delivering almost all of the country's cargo - are small operations. Fierce competition and high fuel prices mean truck drivers are squeezed too despite an acute labour shortage.

A recent government survey showed trucking companies were able to pass on only 19% of their cost increases, compared with 47% for small- and medium-sized firms. That would make it difficult for small companies to hire to make up for the lower number of legal working hours per driver.

Underscoring the difficulties smaller players face, the Fair Trade Commission in December named and shamed 13 firms that it said abused their superior bargaining power to refuse price increase requests from smaller contractors and suppliers. Six were logistics and delivery majors, including Trancom (9058.T) and Sagawa Express (9143.T). Both companies promised to make improvements.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida last month instructed his cabinet to come up with ""drastic"" measures by June to address the crisis. A dedicated lane over a 100km (62-mile) stretch of highway connecting Tokyo and Nagoya for self-driving trucks and a flight route for delivery drones are planned from next fiscal year.

Some retailers have devised ways to soften the impact.

Convenience store operator Lawson (2651.T) will reduce deliveries of lunch boxes to twice a day from three times for all outlets by April 2024. Supermarket chain operators Summit, Maruetsu, Yaoko (8279.T) and Life Corp (8194.T) agreed to allow an extra day for delivery and reduce overnight shipping.

Many far-flung producers, though, have no plan.

Farmers and fish wholesalers from Kyushu to the northernmost island of Hokkaido fear for their livelihood and local economies if there aren't enough drivers.

Masaaki Iwamori, an official at the Ehime Fishers Cooperative on the western island of Shikoku, said the town of Uwajima could wither without trucks to deliver its famed amberjack by 2 a.m. to Tokyo's main fish market, a 12-hour drive away.

""If the fish aren't ready in time, they lose their freshness when they're auctioned the next day"" at a significant discount, he said. ""Maybe once consumers start noticing the drop in quality, they'll share the sense of crisis.""

https://gulfbusiness.com/e-commerce-how-to-prepare-business-for-success/,E-commerce strategies: How to prepare your business for success,"As the world moves further into a digital age, the Middle East market is poised for a second wave of e-commerce growth. Driven by a young, tech-savvy population and the impact of Covid-19, the region’s e-commerce sector has experienced an exponential increase in sales and user adoption, giving rise to a new generation of digital-native household brands, such as NowNow, Namshi, Eyewa and Squatwolf.

Growth is expected to continue at a double-digit rate, of around 20 per cent per year, bringing the total market value to $70bn by 2025. Advancements in technology, such as Web3 and artificial intelligence, are expected to further accelerate market growth, paving way for the next generation of e-commerce businesses.

To capture this opportunity, businesses must adopt agile and adaptable e-commerce strategies, navigating challenges of this ever-evolving landscape. Rising customer expectations, stricter data protection regulations, and intensifying competition are just a few examples of changes forcing businesses to rethink their online strategies. To thrive, businesses should develop tailored e-commerce strategies around a set of clearly defined core capabilities.

Here are some key areas that businesses can focus on to build a strong e-commerce strategy in the Middle East.

Omnichannel strategy

To accelerate growth, regional businesses should consider adopting an omnichannel approach integrating online direct-to-consumer models, online marketplaces, and offline channels. Despite the seeming contradiction, offline still represents the lion’s share of the total market value in the Middle East. Offline presence – via own stores or wholesale partners – can offer attractive avenues of growth for digital-native businesses and unique advantages like personalised, face-to-face service and sales support, which can help complement and elevate online performance.

UAE-based brand Eyewa serves as an excellent example of an online business successfully growing through offline presence – founded in 2017 as an online platform, Eyewa has expanded with 60 stores in the GCC over the last two years. Channel decisions should be considered in the context of the underlying business model and strategy; an integrated omnichannel approach can create positive spill-over effects on online channels.

Leverage content to build a platform

The democratisation of media has led to the emergence of numerous content creators who have built influential platforms and solid personal brands, later monetised via various products and services. Notable examples include Kim Kardashian’s Skims and Huda Kattan’s Huda Beauty, showcasing the power of content-driven brand growth. With diminishing returns from online marketing channels and traditional influencer collaborations, it is imperative for consumer-oriented e-commerce businesses to find new ways of reaching their target audience. Content creation can serve as a powerful lever to build platform and reach, to mitigate rising customer-acquisition-costs online.

Establish a flexible logistics infrastructure

Logistics and last-mile delivery remain critical challenges for e-commerce businesses in the Middle East. The underdeveloped infrastructure in the region hinders many companies from meeting customer expectations with regards to same-day and next-day deliveries. Cross-border shipping is further complicated by import costs, customs duties, and VAT, impacting order fulfillment and reverse logistics.

To overcome these hurdles, businesses must establish a reliable and adaptable logistics network tailored to regional requirements. Possible solutions include establishing a capillary fulfillment infrastructure via retail stores and / or brand partners to cater to customer expectations, whilst also employing measures to optimise operations. Decisions regarding logistics setup are closely connected to core strategic questions and should be guided by decisions regarding current and future focus markets.

E-commerce strategy: Conclusion

To build a successful e-commerce strategy, business need to navigate the challenges and capitalise on the opportunities presented by the region’s evolving landscape. From an omnichannel approach to content-centric strategies and flexible logistics infrastructure, there are several key areas and considerations that businesses must take into account when defining their e-commerce strategies. By focusing on select set of core capabilities and investing in the right areas, businesses can build a strong position in the e-commerce space and seize the opportunity for growth that is likely to be seen in regional markets in the next decade and beyond.

https://jingdaily.com/beauty-brands-court-china-gen-z-cherry-blossom-collaborations-sakura/,Beauty Brands Court China’s Gen Z Via Cherry Blossom Collaborations,"Jing Daily’s monthly Chinese Collabs column looks at the China-related collaborations and drops that are transforming the luxury landscape. From local fashion brands to C-beauty, virtual idols to NFTs, and KOLS to lifestyle and games, it offers a curated selection of what’s dropping and the trends behind them.

Sales of cherry blossom season-themed products in China this year hit $1.16 billion (8 billion RMB) on Tmall, with Gen Z and millennials accounting for over 70 percent of transactions, according to the platform. Notably, demand increased three fold, compared to 2021.

Given the lucrative opportunity of rising demand, brands such as Diptyque, Starbucks, and Guerlain, have turned some of their popular products a cherry-pink and created exclusive collaborations to reach young consumers. But they have to be quick.

“The cherry blossom season is very short. You have to wait a year if you miss it,” Jonathan Yan, principal at Munich-headquartered management consultancy Roland Berger, told Jing Daily. He believes the theme is suitable for limited edition products.

Though many consumer businesses have already deployed a cherry blossom theme, “brands need to come out with innovative ideas to distinguish themselves,” says Yan.

Jing Daily analyzes three of this year’s notable cherry blossom season collaborations and how they resonate with homegrown consumers.

Guerlain x Ateliers Vermont

For the past few years, French fragrance label Guerlain has annually created a new limited-edition Cherry Blossom bottle to pay homage to the popular custom of viewing cherry blossoms. For 2023, the brand partnered with Parisian embroidery house Ateliers Vermont to decorate its iconic bee bottle.

The neck of the bottle, adorned with golden and tubular beads along the body, is tied with a pink grosgrain bow. Hand-stitched to it is a cherry branch embroidered with fine golden thread. The flowers on the stem are created with delicate tulles adorned with pink, red, and transparent beads.

Despite the high price range, a bottle retails for $760 (5,300 RMB), the sophisticated collaboration was well-received by netizens. The tie-up generated $393,000 (2.7 million RMB) in Media Impact Value (MIV), according to Launchmetrics.

“The addition of cherry elements resonates with the brand DNA, without being cliché,” Yan from Roland Berger says.

Harmay x Horoy

Chinese multi-brand beauty store Harmay partnered with Japanese light liquor brand Horoy to create a cherry-tasting beverage and decorated its stores in pink hues to fully immerse consumers in the streets of Japan, where appreciating sakura, or cherry blossom, is a national spring pastime.

The initiative prompted many consumers to visit the store and share pictures from their visits online. On its official Xiaohongshu account, Harmay announced it had prepared 60 gift boxes containing the limited-edition beverage, Nars’ Orgasm blusher, and L’Occitane’s lip balm for users, selected through a lottery system, who share their experiences on the lifestyle platform using specified hashtags. The gift inducement helped the collaboration generate $21,700 (150,000 RMB) MIV, per Launchmetrics data.

Founded in 2017, Harmay is a domestic multi-brand beauty retailer that sells small-sized cosmetics of Chinese and international brands for less than $15 (100 RMB). Thanks to its budget-friendly price point and social media-friendly boutique interior, it soon attracted the attention of younger consumers.

My Clarins x Nowwa

Coffee culture is spreading among young students and white-collar workers, and more and more beauty and fashion brands are partnering with coffee shops to reach China’s young shoppers.

Clarins’ skincare line dedicated to teenagers — My Clarins — has also tapped the trend. For this spring, it tied up with entry-price point Nowwa coffee chain to create exclusive cherry blossom-themed coffees and gifted samples of its products.

By leveraging coffee culture and cherry blossom fever, My Clarins has united two trends in one initiative. The tactic helped the brand boost awareness of its products among young Chinese shoppers. According to Launchmetrics, the collaboration generated $20,900 (143,000 RMB) in MIV.

Though Yan argues that the collaboration did not align with the beauty brand’s image, he agrees that the marketing strategies would resonate with younger demographics. “No matter what, promotions like buying a coffee and getting free face cream samples are highly attractive to Gen Z. They are ‘newness’ and cost-friendly-driven,” he says.

The short cherry blossom season comprises a goldmine of opportunity for consumer brands, with businesses marketing limited edition spring products in season-exclusive cherry pink shades or flavors. But should more luxury players follow suit?

While the tactic works for beauty and beverage brands, luxury houses need to take into consideration their brand’s affinity with the theme. “When it comes to luxury brands, it is crucial to find concepts that fit the brand tone,” adds Yan.

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus said it would focus on the research of its futuristic hydrogen-powered aircraft at its new research center in the Suzhou Industrial Park in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, which opened on Friday.

Airbus said the center would take advantage of the skilled aviation and hydrogen technologies in the Yangtze River Delta region, and gain from its proximity to the region's strong aeronautical and hydrogen supply chain.

The research will include manufacturing innovation, hydrogen infrastructure and cabin experience, such as introducing 5G technologies into the cabin. The center will also push forward the transformation and modernization of the aviation industry through digitalization and artificial intelligence.

Airbus aims to gather top talents and promote the development of the aerospace industry in the region. At the research center in Suzhou, Chinese employees account for the majority of the workforce, it said.

""Besides its promising aviation market, China offers advanced technological advantages in many fields. Airbus is working with partners, and China in particular, to nurture technologies, discover various resources, introduce alternative fuels, and develop the hydrogen ecosystem as we work toward sustainable aviation,"" said Sabine Klauke, chief technical officer of Airbus.

The opening of the new facility further indicates Airbus' long-term commitment to develop and invest in China, its largest market globally, after it signed agreements with Chinese partners in early April to expand the Airbus A320 Family final assembly capacity with a second assembly line in Tianjin.

Meanwhile, in early April, Airbus signed an agreement with China National Aviation Fuel Group to strengthen Chinese-European cooperation on the production of sustainable aviation fuels. The new agreement aims to optimize the SAF supply chain by diversifying sources and enhancing SAF production toward a goal of using 10 percent of SAF by 2030 globally, Airbus said.

SAF production doubled in 2022 and reached 300 million liters, according to the International Air Transport Association.

""Airbus is not a fuel producer, but we are working with our partners in the aviation, logistics and energy industries to support this development. However, even with 80 percent in emission reductions, flying will not be carbon-neutral. This is why, we are also working on new propulsion and aircraft models,"" Klauke said.

By 2035, Airbus aims to bring the world's first zero-emission commercial aircraft to the market. This is consistent with China's goal to peak its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, Airbus said.

""Air transportation is irreplaceable in contributing to domestic and international communications. Carbon emissions reduction in the civil aviation sector has been a long process and positive achievements have been gradually emerging,"" said Yu Zhanfu, a partner of consultancy Roland Berger.",[],2023-04-15 00:00:00

Reuters, TOKYO





Truck driver Yuichi Tomita has been delivering packages all over Japan for two decades, often clocking 40 straight hours on the road.

The work is tough, but a source of pride, he said, adding that he has never thought of quitting — until now.

On April 1 next year, the Japanese government would limit truck drivers’ annual overtime to 960 hours, along with other reforms officials have said are meant to improve the job’s notoriously grueling conditions and make it more attractive.

Truck driver Yuichi Tomita stands next to his truck in a parking area in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, on Thursday. Photo: REUTERS

However, the law would instead lead to an exodus from an occupation that requires most people to work extra hours to pay bills, Tomita said.

That has sparked fears of what those in retail and logistics call the “2024 crisis” — a critical shortage of truck drivers that, if unaddressed, could leave one-third of all cargo undelivered and result in a potential ￥10 trillion (US$75.8 billion) hit to the world’s third-largest economy by 2030..

“I’ve been doing this job for 20 years and you just can’t make ends meet on base pay alone,” said Tomita, a second-generation trucker and father of a three-year-old. “I really think this crisis is going to threaten Japan’s economy and families like ours.”

Drivers make ￥4.46 million per year on average. That is about 10 percent below the average for all industries despite working 20 percent longer hours.

An expected drop-off in the number of truck drivers would set off a domino effect for farmers, shops and diners accustomed to next-day delivery of fresh fish and produce.

The global consultancy Roland Berger expects a 20 percent decline in the number of Japanese truck drivers in the decade to 2030.

“Simply put, people in Tokyo will have no means to get fresh vegetables or fish from Kyushu [in southern Japan] and other far-off regions,” Roland Berger partner Masashi Onozuka said. “That could affect consumer spending and other areas too.”

About 98 percent of Japan’s 62,000 trucking companies — responsible for delivering almost all of the country’s cargo — are small operations. Fierce competition and high fuel prices mean truck drivers are squeezed despite an acute labor shortage.

A recent government survey showed trucking companies were able to pass on only 19 percent of their cost increases, compared with 47 percent for small and medium-sized firms. That would make it difficult for small companies to hire to make up for the lower number of legal working hours per driver.

Underscoring the difficulties smaller players face, the Fair Trade Commission in December last year named 13 firms that it said abused their superior bargaining power to refuse price increase requests from smaller contractors and suppliers.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida last month instructed his Cabinet to come up with “drastic” measures by June to address the crisis. A dedicated lane on a 100km stretch of highway connecting Tokyo and Nagoya for self-driving trucks and a flight route for delivery drones are planned for the next fiscal year.

Some retailers have devised ways to soften the impact. Convenience store operator Lawson would reduce deliveries of lunch boxes to twice a day from three times for all outlets by April next year. Supermarket chain operators Summit, Maruetsu, Yaoko and Life Corp agreed to allow an extra day for delivery and reduce overnight shipping.

However, many far-flung producers have no plan. Farmers and fish wholesalers from Kyushu to the northernmost island of Hokkaido fear for their livelihood and local economies if there are not enough drivers.

The town of Uwajima on the western island of Shikoku could wither without trucks to deliver its amberjack by 2am to Tokyo’s main fish market, Ehime Fishers Cooperative official Masaaki Iwamori said.

“If the fish aren’t ready in time, they lose their freshness when they’re auctioned the next day” at a significant discount, he said. “Maybe once consumers start noticing the drop in quality, they’ll share the sense of crisis.”",[],2023-04-08 00:00:00
https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/chinese-ev-startup-nio-targets-200000-sales-2023,"Nio co-founder predicts big gains in sales, battery swap stations","What are your plans for the United States?

We have a dedicated team there. It's not very big yet. They are there to understand, analyze and plan how to enter the U.S. market. But we don't have a concrete starting time. We need to get a better understanding of the overall market because the U.S., in terms of legislation and rules, is very different from China, while Europe is more similar. That means if we want to develop a European version of a car, the costs will not be that high as if we wanted to develop a U.S. version. Some fundamental parts of the car have to be changed, so it's a bigger job. This is just one example of the differences. But we take entering the U.S. market very seriously. We think there is a big opportunity there in the future despite the challenges.

Were you at all encouraged by the Inflation Reduction Act, which seemed to be pulling a lot of investment toward development of EVs in the U.S. market?

It depends on which part of the value chain you want to invest. For example, we have had an R&D presence in the U.S. for more than seven years. There have been some ups and downs [the team was reduced to more than 300 from about 600 engineers when Nio hit its first financial troubles in 2019], but overall, it has been a very pleasant experience for us. I also think our R&D presence in the U.S. will increase. But manufacturing as well as sales and service are separate topics that we need to address one by one.

What kind of work is your R&D team doing in the U.S.?

They focus on autonomous driving technologies. The team has won awards for its work and has established itself as a positive and influential player in Silicon Valley. The team is helping us keep the same pace on the technological side as some of the most advanced companies in the world.

Software problems have delayed multiple models at traditional automakers. What has Nio done to avoid problems and delays?

The move to smart cars is a new challenge for the car industry. That is why we decided that the ultimate product for the foreseeable future would be the smart electric vehicle. The long-established OEMs are very good at making vehicles, but for EVs the best representative today is probably Tesla. And we are also doing well because we have our own competence around EV development and the manufacture of e-motors. And when it comes to making cars smarter, this isn't an evolution, it's a revolution, because it's a completely new species. Since we are a startup, we don't have any legacy to maintain, so we can move faster than most of the others. Nio might be the only company in the world that is currently managing several generations of smart platforms.

Could you elaborate?

Our first cars used Nio Technology 1.0. Our new cars use NT 2.0 and by late 2024 or early 2025 we will launch our third-generation smart platform. That means we are maintaining one generation, selling one generation and developing yet another generation. That is three generations of smart platforms. That is huge. Especially when you consider that, unlike a smart phone, which people use for as little as two to three years, a car will need to be able to be updated for 15 years. That's a new challenge. For example, you have to build up a stock of chips so you can continue to update those cars and fix problems that arise. Very few people in this industry realize how complicated this is. That is why more than half of our R&D personnel focus on software and smart technology. It's very important.",['Douglas A. Bolduc'],2023-04-11 16:59:58-04:00

https://premium.goauto.com.au/threat-car-prices-still-tumble-in-china/,Threat: Car prices still tumble in China,"CHINA, the world’s biggest car market, is in the middle of a “short-sighted” and fierce price war that has already seen price cuts for about 650 models representing about 20 per cent of its new-car market.

The cuts have led Bloomberg to speculate that shrinking profits of the domestic car-makers had the potential for “cost-cutting that may compromise quality and innovation”.

“The long-term sustainability of some automakers is even coming into question,” Bloomberg said.

Data compiled by research provider, China Auto Market, from more than 3000 model variants has shown that discounting is intensifying. A year ago, about six per cent of the market’s new cars showed price falls.

As an average, Bloomberg used China Auto Market (CAM) data to determine that the recent transaction prices have shaved more than 10,000 yuan ($A2175) from the listed recommended retail prices.

The cuts are attributed to intense competition that has led to domestic and international car-makers reducing retail prices.

It is compounded by increased subsidies offered by provinces that have car-building plants. For example, a Chinese-made Citroen C6 has had its price temporarily cut by more than 40 per cent.

This followed the Hubei province, in which manufacturer Dongfeng Motor Group is based, offering incentives of up to 90,000 yuan ($A19,600) in a promotion that ran through to the end of March.

Automotive News China reported that Chevrolet started offering discounts of as much as 70,000 yuan ($A15,200) on the Blazer SUV, which starts at 230,000 yuan ($A50,000), along with other models such as the Equinox and Monza.

Jilin province in north eastern China is offering 150 million yuan ($A32.6m) of subsidies this month for people buying cars made by FAW Group with discounts on individual cars of up to 37,000 yuan ($A8050).

Car sales have shown a slower-than-expected recovery after China abolished its ‘Covid Zero’ policy in December.

Sales of petrol and diesel cars have also been affected as consumers prefer EVs with demand helped along by price cuts from Tesla and BYD.

Automotive News China quoted China’s Passenger Car Association data that showed sales of internal-combustion engine (ICE) vehicles fell 13 per cent in 2022 while battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) rose 74 per cent and plug-in hybrids surged 161 per cent.

ANC quoted Ron Zheng, a Shanghai-based partner at consulting firm Roland Berger, who said the bigger incentives and subsidies offered by the Hubei government was aimed at stimulating car sales “because consumers are still cautious about spending, while the models being discounted are mainly ones that need stock urgently cleared.”

“The dramatic price drop will have a huge impact on the residual value of used cars, as well as brand loyalty,” Mr Zheng said. “I would say the move might be a bit short-sighted.”

Car-makers started discounting after Tesla, which has two plants in China and is building a large battery factory in Shanghai, in January cut prices of its domestic models by up to 14 per cent.

This snowballed to other car-makers in China. The biggest sustained fall is the Toyota bZ4X ‘Joy’ all-electric model that CAM showed had a transaction price of 139,380 yuan ($A30,300) in March, 30 per cent down from 199,800 yuan ($A43,450) in December.

Bloomberg said that Audi and BMW were also discounting, particularly on their electric models.

Bloomberg said that it was not unusual for car-makers and dealers to give incentives to clear inventory of older models.

What is unusual is concerns about shrinking profits of the domestic car-makers and also the potential for cost-cutting that may compromise quality and innovation.

“The long-term sustainability of some automakers is even coming into question,” Bloomberg said.

“Tesla’s shares plunged 6.1 per cent earlier this month on concern that significant price cuts early this year have only yielded an incremental gain in vehicle sales.”

China’s Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) wants to end the price war, saying it won’t be a long-term solution to a reduction in sales and high inventories. It has urged car-makers to “return to normal operation” to ensure the industry’s sustainable future.

https://www.msn.cn/zh-cn/news/other/shanghai-announces-24-investment-promotion-policies-to-attract-new-businesses/ar-AA19y0re,Shanghai announces 24 investment promotion policies to attract new businesses,"Shanghai has announced a fresh set of 24 investment promotion policies to attract businesses to the city, including a maximum reward of 100 million yuan (US$14.54 million) for significant investment projects.

The Shanghai Global Investment Promotion Conference 2023 was held at the Shanghai Expo Center on Thursday morning, inviting the world to share in opportunities for development and collaborate on major plans.

A new round of 24 measures promoting investment was launched at the conference, aimed at tailoring policy packages for businesses and enhancing their investment confidence.

Among them, one of the most noteworthy policies is to provide incentives for top-tier industrial projects, with a maximum support of up to 100 million yuan to be granted upon project execution.

Additionally, the city will provide a subsidy of up to 10 million yuan for purchasing or leasing property for headquartered projects.

It also pledges to leverage the advantage of having a cluster of financial institutions, to integrate and utilize various industry investment funds with a total scale of 100 billion yuan. This will facilitate investment and financing channels for industries and enable investment to attract projects.

The new policy also clarifies that high-quality projects in the city's three leading industries, namely integrated circuits, biomedicine and artificial intelligence, may receive support of up to 100 million yuan.

Specifically, in the integrated circuit sector, the focus will be on attracting investment in key links.

In biomedicine, high-quality companies will be encouraged to establish various types of headquarters, research and development centers, and production bases in Shanghai.

While in artificial intelligence, efforts will be made to accelerate the attraction of intelligent chip, core algorithms, operating systems and other projects, and to speed up the implementation of high-quality projects.

The conference also announced a number of achievements in investment promotion and talent attraction.

In 2022, Shanghai successfully signed and implemented 1,375 key investment projects worth over one billion yuan each, with a total investment of over 1.2 trillion yuan.

Since the beginning of this year, the city has signed 353 major industrial projects with a combined investment of 225.4 billion yuan.

Recently, another 168 major investment projects with a total investment of 327 billion yuan were identified, and 26 large-scale and high-level representative projects were signed at the conference, with a total investment of 67.4 billion yuan.

The projects signed today cover the city's key industries and new areas, as well as the cutting-edge fields in future industries.

For example, in the field of biomedicine, consumer health company Haleon plans to invest 1 billion yuan to build a health product production base in the Lingang Special Area.

XFH Technology in the green and low-carbon industry, meanwhile, is ramping up its investment in Baoshan District, with plans to invest 2.1 billion yuan in the construction of a Shanghai carbon-peak technology and innovation center and a carbon-peak technology and innovation industrial park.

Meanwhile, with emphasis placed on talent, the conference this year introduced a new talent signing ceremony. Ten scientists and high-end industry professionals from home and abroad reached cooperation agreements with 10 local enterprises and research institutions in various fields, to accelerate the transformation of innovative achievements.

Shanghai boasts a robust talent pool, as its currently home to half of the country's 5G experts, 40 percent of integrated circuit specialists, a third of artificial intelligence enthusiasts, and a quarter of innovative pharmaceutical professionals.

""I think the Shanghai business environment is a premium environment in China and in the world, because it adds content and we've seen during the conference that it goes from the machinery, electrical equipment, heavy industry, to top-notch biotech and Internet technology,"" said Denis Depoux, global managing director of Roland Berger.

The city is also a hub, which gives China access to the world, and to a very broad range of capabilities in the Yangtze River Delta region. Plus it's a beautiful and nice city to live in, with a huge reserve of talent. ""This makes it a pretty ideal environment for both domestic and global companies,"" Depoux added.",[],

http://www.china.org.cn/business/2023-04/04/content_85211011.htm,Steady on China to boost domestic demand and keep opening up amid global uncertainty,"Adjust font size:

Although it will face continued global uncertainty, high global inflation and a slowdown in the world economy and trade, China's economy has signaled a rebound as pressure from contraction of demand, supply shocks and weakening expectations eases, a report released during the China Development Forum 2023 read. Themed Economic Recovery: Opportunities and Cooperation this year, the annual event, which took place offline again for the first time since the onset of COVID-19 in 2020, gathered political bigwigs, business magnates, experts and scholars from the world over in Beijing on March 25-27. The forum came as China seeks to revive its economy after adjusting its pandemic control policy in late 2022.

The International Monetary Fund has raised its projection for China's economic growth in 2023 to 5.2 percent. ""For the world economy, however, spring is yet to come,"" Kristalina Georgieva, the fund's Managing Director, said at the forum, adding the rebound of China's economy will deliver a welcome lift to the world, contributing about one third of global growth this year.

""It will buoy steady and sustained development, adding certainty to a global growth clouded by upheavals,"" Han Wenxiu, Executive Deputy Director of the Office of the Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs of China, echoed.

Boosting demand

""Beyond the direct contribution to global growth, our analysis shows that a 1-percentage-point increase in GDP growth in China leads to a 0.3-percentage-point increase in growth in other Asian economies on average — a welcome boost,"" Georgieva added.

During the week-long Chinese New Year holiday from January 21 to 27, tourism revenue in China surged 30 percent year on year and cinemas nationwide reported the second-highest box office figure on record, indicating improving consumer sentiment.

Expanding domestic demand is not only key to supporting economic recovery but also a fundamental method to stabilize the mid- to long-term growth of the world's second largest economy, Wang Yiming, Vice Chairman of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, said.

China now has the world's largest and most dynamic middle- and high-income group, the main consumers of medium- and high-end goods and services in the fields of education, medical care and tourism, Wang said. He called for loosening restrictions on housing purchases to unleash the demand for improved living conditions, stressing that the measures imposed years ago to curb skyrocketing property prices are already unnecessary given the real estate market has stabilized. Big cities should upgrade their urban networks to ease traffic jams and then lift restrictions on auto purchases, he added.

""China should increase the supply of medium- and high-end education and medical services to meet consumer demand at multiple levels,"" Wang suggested.

Lawrence Juen-Yee Lau, a professor of economics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said in the future, China's economic growth would no longer be driven by import and export, but by the aggregate domestic demand, including household consumption, consumption of public goods such as healthcare, education and environmental protection, as well as gross fixed capital formation. The latter, formerly known as gross domestic fixed investment, includes land improvements (fences, ditches, drains and so on); plant, machinery and equipment purchases; and the construction of roads, railways and the likes, including schools, offices, private residential dwellings, etc.

""Household income should be increased to stimulate consumption,"" he added.

To ensure its economic development by expanding domestic demand, the country needs to unleash total factor productivity (TFP), as well as pay greater attention to the downward trend of TFP and its labor force, Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University, said at the forum. TFP is a term used in economics to measure the impact of technological advancements, changes in worker knowledge and other factors on total output growth that cannot be explained by traditional inputs such as labor and capital.

Roach went on to say that even though China has done a good job at increasing employment and real wages, the country's social security, senior care and medical care systems still require further reform.

When families worry about their old-age life, this will negatively affect their consumer decisions and thus drag down consumption growth by large, he added.

Since 2011, the demographic dividend, or economic growth that can result from a shift in population age structure, has gradually disappeared worldwide, and the decline in both TFP and the labor force will continue for a long time to come. China should pay great attention to these downward trends to avoid Japan's experience from the late 1980s to the early 2000s, Roach said. During this period known as Japan's ""Lost Decade,"" the country experienced low growth and deflation. Some economists blamed the economic stagnation on consumers' and companies' excessive precautionary savings, whereas others put it on the country's aging population or its monetary policy—or both.

""Restoring and expanding consumption should be the policy focus for expanding domestic demand,"" Wang said, warning that as external demand shrinks, failing to effectively expand domestic demand risks adding to overcapacity and deflationary pressures.

Future opening up

Since first embarking on reform and opening up in 1978, China has over the decades that followed become deeply embedded in the international value chain and transformed itself into a global manufacturing hub, Yi Xiaozhun, former Deputy Director General of the World Trade Organization, said at the forum.

China will further expand market access and steadily advance opening up in the respect of rules, regulations, management and standards, Han said, adding the country ""welcomes companies from all over the world to invest and expand their businesses in China as part of their long-term strategies.""

Paid-in foreign investment in the Chinese mainland rose from $144.4 billion in 2020 to $189.1 billion last year, according to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.

""China is the BMW Group's largest single market and one of its most strategic. Our largest research and development operations outside of Germany are based in China,"" Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the BMW AG Management Board, said at the forum.

As China's industrial and supply chains adjust to the new environment, the country's economy and market demand can be strong and sustainable, Li Dongsheng, founder and Chairman of TCL Technology Group Corp., a Chinese consumer electronics giant, said. ""TCL looks forward to more cooperation with foreign enterprises in technology and trade, jointly contribute to China's high-quality development and promote the expansion of domestic demand in the Chinese market.""

Just as BMW's investment creates jobs in China, investment from China's largest battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) brings prosperity to Europe, Zipse added. CATL has launched two factories in Germany and Hungary, respectively. The German plant, which kicked off production in December 2022, will have an annual production capacity of 30 million batteries. The plant in Hungary, with a production capacity of 100 GWh, is the largest investment ever to come into the country and is estimated to create 9,000 new jobs.

Despite challenges, cooperation between U.S. companies and their Chinese counterparts remains resilient, Craig Allen, President of the U.S.-China Business Council (USCBC), said.

U.S. exports to China reached record highs in 2022 and China remains a crucial destination for American agriculture, food, chemical exporters and other commodities. Allen added USCBC data suggests about 1 million Americans are employed because of exports to China.

According to Allen, more needs to be done so that China's investment environment will substantially improve. For instance, he hopes there will be more transparent regulations and enforcement practices on data security and privacy regimes, better industrial policies and a finer balance between state-owned enterprises and the private sector. And areas such as cloud computing, Internet services and agricultural biotechnology would benefit from further liberalization, according to him.

""More competitive environments and fairer markets in China will lead to new jobs, innovation and growth,"" Allen said.

China remains a significant market for most foreign companies and has gradually become an important source of innovation to strengthen the global competency of some foreign companies, Denis Depoux, Global Managing Director of European business strategy consultancy Roland Berger, said.

For now, multinational companies are largely unable to leave the Chinese market or decouple from China to develop new global value chain, according to Yi.

Han stressed China will continue to deepen economic cooperation with other countries to maintain the integrity, stability and security of global industrial and supply chains.

The industrial and supply chains in China have improved as domestic and foreign companies invested heavily in modernizing their local production systems, Depoux added.

""China has demonstrated its innovation capability and is leapfrogging in several fields, gaining leadership globally in areas like the electric vehicle chain, from batteries to charging infrastructure, photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, nuclear and telecommunications equipment,"" he added.

Experts: Advancing modernization will move nation up the value chain

New economic growth drivers and competitive advantages will emerge as China beefs up its push to build a modern industrial system amid challenges including the US government's export restrictions on key technologies and the restructuring of global supply chains, renowned economists and industry experts said.

Hans-Paul Burkner, managing director and global chair emeritus of Boston Consulting Group, said China's efforts to advance industrial modernization will help the country move up the value chain, rendering its economy ""more innovative, talent-intensive, consumption-driven and green"".

The term ""modern industrial system"" has become a key phrase in China, with the top leadership highlighting it as a priority for the country's economic development.

In an article published in February in the Qiushi Journal, a flagship magazine of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, said China should accelerate and upgrade its industrial system by planning ahead in key areas and comprehensively modernizing its industrial system.

At a group deliberation during the annual session of China's national legislature last month, Xi, who is also Chinese president, said the manufacturing industry is indispensable to China at all times, and the country should advance new industrialization.

Bai Ming, deputy director of international market research at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, said President Xi's emphasis on manufacturing showed that a modern industrial system will be key to China's economic development over the next few years, and will have a profound impact.

""In the face of growing external risks, 'Made in China' needs to be backed by a stronger industrial system,"" Bai said.

Burkner agreed, telling China Daily that Chinese companies ""have become very competitive, not just because of cost, but also because of quality and innovation. We see quite a lot of Chinese companies being top producers of patents and really good products, and we see them all over the world.""

But a greater push is needed to further boost their innovation capabilities. This will help China maintain its important position in global supply chains amid headwinds such as geopolitical tensions and talks of relocating production back to developed countries, Burkner added.

China has the most complete industrial system in the world, with the country ranked the world's largest manufacturing country for the 13th consecutive year in 2022, when China's manufacturing output accounted for nearly 30 percent of the world's total, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.

But China still faces bottlenecks in crucial technologies such as semiconductors, and more efforts are needed to move toward greener, smarter and higher-end manufacturing, experts said.

""The industrial economy is the field with the most innovation activities,"" said Jin Zhuanglong, minister of industry and information technology.

Statistics show that the industrial economy accounts for less than 20 percent of the US GDP, but 70 percent of US innovation activities are directly or indirectly dependent on its industrial economy, he said.

Amid increasingly fierce international competition, it is necessary to build a modern industrial system and improve the resilience and security of China's industrial and supply chains, Jin said.

The United Nations has forecast that India will surpass China as the most populous country this year, and some experts worry that this could reduce China's advantages in manufacturing.

But Jeffrey Sachs, a renowned economist and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, said: ""China's strength right now is that it is on the cutting edge of many of the most important technology innovations for the future, which will be very good for China's manufacturing industry in the future.""

Denis Depoux, global managing director of consultancy Roland Berger, said industrial modernization is also crucial to unleash further domestic demand and consumption in China.

""To uplift consumption, more disposable income is the key. And this additional wealth can only be generated by an increase in productivity,"" Depoux said.

Xu Zhijun, rotating chairman of Huawei Technologies Co, said it has developed electronic design automation or EDA tools for chips above 14 nanometers by partnering with domestic companies, marking a crucial breakthrough for China's semiconductor industry amid US government restrictions.

Dubbed the ""cradle"" of integrated circuits, EDA is a software widely used in the sector and is of great importance to the entire process of designing chips.

""Amid Washington's restrictions, China's semiconductor industry will not sit idle. We will work harder to pursue breakthroughs,"" Xu said.",[],2023-04-02 00:00:00

Grace Berger is staying in the Hoosier State.

The Indiana Fever selected the IU great with the seventh overall pick in the WNBA draft on Wednesday night, making her the first first-round draft pick in program history.

""I don't know what skills necessarily are going to translate (to the WNBA), but I do know that my passion for the game, my competitiveness, my grittiness and my willingness to do whatever the team needs on any given night will be there and that will translate,"" said Berger, who grew up attending Fever games with her dad. ""I'm excited to get there and see what my coaches want from me and do that to the best of my ability.""

""She's a competitor, loves the game, going to get out and do whatever is needed for her team,"" Fever coach Christie Sides added. ""I had the opportunity to watch her play a lot being close to Indiana and every night, she's going to give you everything she's got. Those are the kind of people we want in this locker room and on the court.""

WNBA draft: Fever take South Carolina star Aliyah Boston with No. 1 overall pick

The all-time winningest player in program history, Berger was a transformational talent for the Hoosiers, leading them to 117 wins over her five seasons with appearances in the Elite Eight and Sweet 16. Individually, she accumulated 1,841 points (seventh-most all-time), 573 assists (second-most) and 752 rebounds, and was responsible for the program's first-ever triple-double as a sophomore.

""I can't wait to see Grace play at the next level, because she's so good,"" teammate Sydney Parrish said following IU's second-round loss to Miami. ""Anyone who's her teammate in the future is going to be beyond lucky to have someone who's as great as a person and as a player as she is.""

Berger, who opted to use her extra year of eligibility (COVID), averaged 12.9 points, 4.8 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 2022-23, leading Indiana to a 28-5 finish that included a Big Ten regular-season title and a No. 1-seed in the NCAA tournament (a program first).

Nicknamed the ""Midrange Queen"" by her teammates, Berger drew comparisons to Dwyane Wade and Dirk Nowitzki from Miami coach Katie Meier, and shot 48.4% from the floor a career-best 40.7% from 3 in her final season.

Berger's shooting prowess speaks for itself, but it's her versatility — and development as a point guard this season — that caught the Fever's attention.

""It helped her so much,"" Sides said of Berger taking the extra year. ""We can play her at the 1, 2 or 3 and that's what's so great about her. She went back this year and really worked on that point guard position, which really helped her.""

The Fever, who won just five games last season, selected South Carolina forward Aliyah Boston with the No. 1 overall pick, and have multiple pieces returning from last season, including leading scorer Kelsey Mitchell and 2022 first-round picks NaLyssa Smith, Emily Engstler, Lexie Hull and Queen Egbo.

""I was able to win a good amount in college, so I can bring some of those characteristics over, but I really think looking at that roster and some of the young talent on it, that's super exciting,"" Berger said. ""You obviously have Aliyah Boston, who we all know is amazing, and then NaLyssa Smith, Queen Egbo, Destanni Henderson — the list goes on and on. To be able to play with that much talent, that much young talent and come in with them and learn from them and grow with them, I think it's something that I'm really excited about.""

In his heyday, no one wanted to play with Tiger Woods.

The aura surrounding the man who was No. 1 in the Official World Golf Ranking for a record 683 weeks was so strong, his opponents often crumpled under the pressure of either catching him or keeping ahead of him.

And as it turns out, that also applies to when Woods is on the same team as you and not even playing.

On Tuesday, ahead of this week’s Masters, Justin Thomas shared a story of when one of his teammates at the 2017 Presidents Cup, Daniel Berger, had to make an uncomfortable request to then-captain Fred Couples.

As Thomas explained, Woods was serving as a vice captain for the U.S. team at Liberty National and was assigned to lead Berger’s pod of players. That didn’t sit well with Berger.

“I don’t know if he was paired with Brooks or someone, but [Berger] went to - I don’t know if it was Freddie or someone - and said, ‘Tiger can’t come with our group,'” Thomas recalled.

“What do you mean?”

“I’m too nervous playing in front of him.”

To be fair, Berger had no practice playing with Woods as the two had not and still have never been paired together on the PGA Tour. Who wouldn’t be nervous playing in front of everyone’s golf idol, who at that point was a 79-time PGA Tour winner and 14-time major champion?

Nevertheless, Thomas said the team tried to rationalize with Berger.

“Dude, he’s on our team. Like he’s our captain,” Thomas remembered somebody telling Berger. “He’s like, ‘I can’t do it, you have to send somebody else with our group.’

“So when we thought we had him to use to our advantage, to make the other team nervous, that actually made some of our own team members nervous. So there’s that.”

The GOAT’s presence couldn’t have had too much of a negative impact on Berger, who went 2-1-0 in his first Presidents Cup appearance as the U.S. team dominated the Internationals 19-11.

And while Woods’ intimated Berger, Thomas had fun with his now-good friend in his vice captain role.

“I couldn’t wait to ask him just go make me a sandwich, like, You’re my vice captain this week. You have to do whatever I say, and all of us,” Thomas said with a laugh. “I never in my life thought I would be bossing Tiger Woods around and he had to listen to me because he’s a vice captain.”

It’s hard being a vice captain: Worrying about intimidating your own team while at the same time remembering each one’s sandwich order.

BLOOMINGTON — Grace Berger sits in front of her locker, staring at the floor as cameras position themselves around her. She's about 30 minutes removed from her final game at Assembly Hall, a second-round NCAA Tournament game against 9th-seeded Miami. This was meant to be a joyous occasion, a celebratory send-off for one of the best in program history and the next step in IU’s quest for a national championship.

But that’s not the case.

Berger is in tears, quietly being comforted by a staff member. Sydney Parrish cries in front of her locker, seated to her Berger's right; Chloe Moore-McNeil can be heard sobbing in the shower. Teammates are scattered around the room, sitting in stunned silence following a heartbreaking 70-68 loss to the Hurricanes.

A season destined to end in Dallas — or, at worst, next weekend in South Carolina — was brought crashing down in Bloomington.

""I knew it was eventually going to come to an end. It was inevitable,"" Berger said. ""I loved being a Hoosier, every single second of it. It's the best decision I've ever made. Coach Moren is someone who's going to impact me far more than just my five years here. I love this program, I love this university, I love my coaches, I love my teammates. It's sad that it's ending, but I'm very grateful that it happened.""

That's Grace Berger.

Known for her stoic demeanor, Berger is the best teammate anyone could ever ask for, coach Teri Moren said, praising her coachability and competitive spirit. ""We're not sitting here where we are today without Grace Berger. I'm so glad she chose us.""

""Grace Berger, she's a beast on the court, but during practices and those little moments, she's super supportive,"" said Geary, a grad transfer from Providence. ""Whenever I didn't get something right away, she was always there to pick me up, and help me out. She's such an amazing player, but it was so nice and comforting to have her pick you up in that way.""

In basketball terms, Berger was an electrifying presence at the dawn of a golden era in Indiana women's basketball. Responsible for the program's first-ever triple-double her sophomore season, she entered Monday's contest with the second-most assists and ninth-most points in program history.

Miami coach Katie Meier compared her to Dwyane Wade prior to the game, then to Dirk Nowitzki afterwards. ""She's really that good,"" Meier said.

With Berger's individual performances came wins (117, to be exact, plus appearances in the Elite 8 and Sweet 16), and with success came a rise in attendance. IU averaged 3,920 fans per game in Berger's freshman season. It averaged over 7,700 this year, with a record 17,222 in attendance for senior day vs. Purdue.

Monday's game was played in front of 14,480 fans, making it the second-largest crowd in program history.

This was the vision Moren pitched to Berger during the recruiting process, a chance to help build a powerhouse while representing a state whose motto is: ""In 49 other states it's just basketball.""

""I hope it's the norm and I think it will be,"" Berger said. ""We have great fans and part of the reason I wanted to come here was to help build that fanbase to be what it is on the men's side. I want that to be part of my legacy, that they keep coming back and supporting this program because it's something super special.""

When being recruited to IU, Berger was pitched on the idea of competing in the Final Four. That concept seemed surreal, a pipe dream, at the time, she admits, but IU came close the past two seasons and was on the doorstep once again this year.

That's why Monday's outcome felt so unbelievably unfair.

Indiana dug itself a massive hole in the first half, then rallied within striking distance in the third quarter — a charge spearheaded by All-American forward Mackenzie Holmes, who'd missed the first round game against Tennessee Tech due to knee soreness — before engaging Miami in a heavyweight boxing match in the fourth quarter.

The visitors led by three with seven seconds remaining, when IU — which had erased a five-point deficit moments earlier — tied the score at 68 on a stepback 3-pointer from the top of the arc by freshman Yarden Garzon, with a behind-the-back assist from Berger.

""That shows what kind of player Grace is, 12 seconds left and she throws a behind-the-back pass to a freshman,"" Parrish said, smiling softly. ""It also shows how special a player Yarden is, making big plays like that as a freshman.""

It was a clutch shot, one Garzon had the confidence to deliver thanks in large part to Berger.

""I think all season she did a really good job believing, no matter what the situation or moment was. Even when we were down, she always believed in us,"" Garzon said of Berger, adding she's the best player she's ever played with (high-praise considering she's played with WNBA players).

Unfortunately, Miami had the last laugh.

Coming out of a timeout, the Hurricanes threw the ball to Destiny Harden in the lane. The forward stepped to her left, then pulled back and swung back to her right, jumping straight up from the middle of the lane. Harden lofted a shot over Berger's outstretched arm. The orange sphere rolled across the rim, bounced gently off the back of the basket and fell through.

On a spring from the subsequent inbounds, Chloe Moore-McNeil lost control of the ball, the buzzer sounded and the celebration was on for Miami.

Thirty minutes later, Parrish is taking her turn with reporters. Berger sits slightly angled away from her, a towel draped over her head.

Can you put into words what's going through your head, sitting next to her right now?

Parrish, a Hamilton Southeastern grad and the lone in-state product on IU's roster, is immediately overcome by emotion, struck by the finality of the loss, the journey that led her to transfer from Oregon to Indiana over the summer and the role Berger played in reigniting her love for the game.

She takes a couple seconds to collect herself, then tearfully crafts a thoughtful, poignant response.

""I didn't know one player could have so much impact, that one school could have so much impact on me as a basketball player,"" Parrish says. ""I was so lost before coming here. I didn't like basketball. And I love it again. And it's because of Indiana basketball. It's because of these girls.""

As Parrish pauses once more, Berger reaches over and pats her on the leg, silently offering her teammate support as she continues.

Parrish made it to a Sweet 16 with Oregon, but she wasn't happy. ""I'd rather be here and lose in the second round, and be happy. I love it here, I love these girls, I love this staff.""

""It breaks my heart that this is the last time I've played with Grace and Alyssa (Geary),"" Parrish says. ""I can't wait to see Grace play at the next level, because she's so good. Anyone who's her teammate in the future is going to be beyond lucky to have someone who's as great as a person and as a player as she is.""

As the open locker room session neared its conclusion, giving those involved time to properly grieve and cherish their final moments together as teammates, Moren fielded one last question about her star player in the media workroom.

""She touches everybody in their own way because of who she is as a human being,"" Moren said. ""She's one of the very best to ever put on a uniform and I can't wait to see what's next for her. … That's why they're so emotional about her, because she means so much to all of us.""

Erik ten Hag ‘urgently’ wants to sign Jude Bellingham

On Tuesday it emerged that Liverpool had ended their long-standing pursuit of Jude Bellingham, due to the price it would cost to sign the England international.

Advert 10

While the likes of Manchester City and Real Madrid are favourites to sign the 19-year-old, Erik ten Hag is also thought to be interested in recruiting the midfielder this summer.

German football reporter Patrik Berger claimed the United boss is desperate to bring Bellingham to Old Trafford.

He tweeted: ""Real and City in the Jude Bellingham race. Understand Man United have outsider chances. ETH urgently wants the England star. Three years ago the midfielder visited Carrington and met Sir Alex.

""But: Bellingham to stay at Dortmund also not ruled out. BVB still have hopes.""

Marcus Thuram to move for FREE this summer

United have been keen to add a striker to their ranks ever since the acrimonious departure of Cristiano Ronaldo in November.

And while they have been linked to the likes of Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen, strikers that would cost north of £100million, a cost-effective alternative would be Borussia Monchengladbach’s Marcus Thuram.

Thuram, who has claimed 44 goals and 27 assists in 133 Gladbach appearances, is reportedly a target for both United and Arsenal and will be available for free this summer.

Advert 10

Gladbach sporting director Roland Virkus confirmed on the club's website that the 25-year-old and his teammate Ramy Bensebaini would be leaving in the summer.

Virkus admitted: ""We were in open communication with both players and knew the current status. It's a shame that they won't be extending their expiring contracts because we've both given a lot in terms of sport over the past four years.

""It's always been part of our path over the past few years to bring in such talented players, to develop them further – and at some point let them go because we can't keep them forever.

""Ideally, we'll get an attractive transfer fee with these transfers. Of course, it's not good that that's not the case now.""

Alexis Mac Allister’s father opens up about his son’s future

Ten Hag has been in pursuit of a midfielder ever since he walked through the door at Carrington.

And Alexis Mac Allister is a player United are thought to be keen on along with Liverpool and Chelsea, with the latter having allegedly approached the player's camp over a potential deal this summer.

Advert 10

And speaking to Argentinian outlet Puro Boca, Mac Allister’s father Carlos Mac Allister admitted his son is likely to leave Brighton in the next transfer window.

He said, via Bola VIP: “Normally the next book of passes will find him playing in another institution.

""We don’t know which one, the talks are just beginning in general, but it is most likely that Alexis will already be playing in another team next July.”

Man Utd and Liverpool told Caicedo’s asking price

Mac Allister isn’t the only Brighton midfielder in high demand.

Both United and Liverpool are thought to be tracking Moises Caicedo too, who has been central to Brighton’s rise to seventh in the Premier League this term.

Arsenal also saw two bids, worth up to £70million, rejected for the Ecuador international in the January transfer window.",[],

Now, she wants to restore the franchise to what it was.","Grace Berger grew up a Fever fan. Now, she wants to restore the franchise to what it was.

Grace Berger wasn't sure what it would feel like to hear her name called during the WNBA draft Monday, and it was all still sinking in for the former IU star when she met with reporters shortly after being selected seventh overall.

To be drafted at all was surreal. But to be picked by the Indiana Fever, the team she grew up watching, while sitting next to her dad, the man who'd been taking her to Fever games since she was 6 years old? ""That made it that much more special.""

""Playing in Indiana for the past five years, the community is so special to me (and they are) so excited about women's basketball,"" Berger said. ""I was really sad to leave IU, but now I'm staying here, so I'm super grateful for that.""

WNBA draft grades: Fever score top marks

Doyel: Aliyah Boston worthy Fever successor to Tamika

Berger is a true Fever fan. She and her dad, Todd, made the two-hour trip from Louisville at least 4-5 times per season growing up, and she recalls celebrating the team's 2012 WNBA championship.

Berger grew up watching the likes of Tamika Catchings, Katie Douglas and Briann January, drawing inspiration from those ""strong women"" and the way they competed, their toughness and their passion for the game. ""I modeled myself off of them,"" Berger continued. ""It was huge, very instrumental in the development of my own game.""

That Berger gets to remain in the Hoosier State, playing with the team she grew up rooting for is extremely cool, and, for the Fever, makes a lot of sense from a business standpoint — Grace Berger is going to sell a lot of tickets. But that's not why general manager Lin Dunn drafted the four-time all-Big Ten honoree, a point she emphasized when asked about Berger's history with the franchise.

""Let me be clear about Grace Berger: We drafted her because she's an exceptional player,"" Dunn said. ""She's an exceptional player who can play three positions, who's an exceptional person off-the-court and just happens to be down the road. … She is (coach) Christie Sides' type of player.""

Sides cited Berger's competitive spirit and passion for the game in the moments after making the pick, but it was the expansion of the 6-0 guard's game and versatility that made her an ideal fit for the Fever at No. 7. She proved adept at running point in her first full season at the position, while also expanding her shooting range and improving her ability to finish around the rim.

Dunn and Sides witnessed Berger's development firsthand, sitting courtside for the Hoosiers' wins over No. 9 Maryland and No. 5 Iowa. Berger's performances in those games — eight assists vs. Maryland; 26 points, six assists, nine rebounds vs. Iowa — reinforced ""what an exceptional player"" she is, Dunn said, demonstrating her emergence as a floor general and ability to elevate those around her as she battled against Maryland's Diamond Miller (drafted second overall by the Minnesota Lynx) and Iowa's Caitlin Clark.

""Seeing her in-person in those two games — and those were big games — was major for us,"" Dunn said.

The Fever have seen what Berger is capable of. And though the franchise has fallen on hard times, Berger understands the heights Indiana can reach. She grew up with the Fever, modeling aspects of her game after those aforementioned all-time greats: Catchings, Douglas and January.

Berger built IU basketball into the powerhouse it is today, and she's eager to help cultivate a similar winning culture with the Fever, joining a solid core of returning players with a draft class that includes No. 1 overall pick Aliyah Boston (South Carolina) — ""I couldn't ask for a better person to go on this journey with,"" said Berger, who has played with Boston at USA Basketball — and No. 13 pick Taylor Mikesell (Ohio State).

Asked what it would mean to restore Indiana Fever basketball to what it once was, Berger replied: ""It would mean a lot to me.""

""One of the things that was the most special to me in my five years at Indiana was to see the community's excitement for women's basketball grow to where it's at now,"" she said. ""Obviously people are crazy about basketball in Indiana, but they're crazy about women's basketball in Indiana. We were able to build that fan base (at IU) and that was so special to me, and at the professional level, I think that excitement just takes a step up. Hopefully we will have a lot of Indiana Hoosier fans there during the summertime and (becoming) huge Indiana Fever fans.""

Health & Fitness Joint Specialist Dr. Berger Reaches New Milestone of 25,000 Surgeries Renowned Joint Replacement Specialist Richard Berger, M.D. Reaches New Milestone: 25,000 Joint Replacement Surgeries Reply

(Dr. Richard Berger of Midwest Orthopaedics of Rush)

March 30, 2023, Chicago, IL - Richard A. Berger, M.D., a world-renowned orthopedic surgeon at Midwest Orthopaedics at Rush who is known for his minimally invasive joint replacement surgeries, has performed 25,000 hip and knee replacement surgeries making him one of the only surgeons in the country to reach that landmark.

Dr. Berger, who is also Assistant Professor at Rush University Medical Center, was one of the first to introduce outpatient hip and knee replacements, allowing patients to go home on the day of their surgery. This spring, he will have performed more than 15,000 outpatient joint replacements. Internationally known for his surgical expertise that limits the cutting of muscles, tendons, and ligaments, Dr. Berger has developed a technique that allows patients to recover much faster than those who have a traditional joint replacement. That’s why patients fly in from all over the world to get their hip or knee replacements from Dr. Berger.

In an article in the Chicago Tribune, Dr. Berger was named “the doctor who treats the stars and celebrities” because many famous actors, politicians, and professional athletes choose him for their hip and knee replacements. Before attending Tufts University for medical school, Dr. Berger earned an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering from MIT. That background has helped him design implants, specialized surgical tools, and his unprecedented tissue-sparing procedure that enables patients to walk up the stairs and out the door within hours after surgery. Patients also experience a more complete recovery so they can return quickly to their sports and activities.

Just ask Ray Medley, Milwaukee hip replacement patient and extreme athlete. He researched the best physician for his hip replacement and decided on Dr. Berger. “He told me I could run marathons and even skydive after hip replacement and that’s all I needed to hear,” says former paratrooper Ray Medley. “Within six months, I was back in the parachute again and today I’m doing formation sky diving with jumpers over age 60 and we are breaking Guinness Book of World Records.” “It’s extremely rewarding to be able to help patients quickly return to daily living and doing the things they love, whether it’s golf or skydiving,” says Dr. Berger.

Since 50 percent of his patients are from out of town, he offers an unparalleled concierge telehealth program for hip and knee replacement patients. With Berger’s Elective Surgical + Telemedicine (BEST) Experience, patients can do pre- and post-surgical consultations from the convenience of their home and only need to travel to Chicago for a meeting with Dr. Berger followed by surgery the next day. The BEST Experience is more convenient and a time saver and offers patients significant cost savings in transportation, lodging, and incidental costs. Additionally, the program allows for a patient’s loved ones to conference in from all over the world prior to and following the surgery.

https://www.chronicle.com/article/roland-griffiths-magical-profession,Roland Griffiths’ Magical Profession,"O ver his half-century career at the Johns Hopkins University, Roland R. Griffiths has published hundreds of papers, most of them having to do with the downsides of drugs, attempts to understand the mechanisms of dependence and withdrawal. He examined how nicotine influences behavior, puff by puff. He compared the effects of cocaine and a prescription stimulant in baboons. He went deep on the world’s most widely used drug, caffeine, concluding that our love for espresso has elements of a diagnosable disorder.

But he’s best known for one paper. Unlike nearly all the rest of his work, it’s focused on the possible benefits of a chemical compound. That paper, published in 2006 in the journal Psychopharmacology, helped resurrect an area of inquiry that had been stigmatized and mostly moribund. The title — “Psilocybin can occasion mystical-type experiences having substantial and sustained personal meaning and spiritual significance” — is a clue that you’re in for something different. In the study, about two-thirds of subjects who took psilocybin, a psychoactive compound in so-called magic mushrooms, rated the experience as either the most meaningful, or among the most meaningful, of their lives, right up there with the birth of a child. It’s a finding that takes a minute to process. The most meaningful? Of their entire lives?

That wasn’t the first time subjects in a study conducted at an elite university had their minds blown, but it was the first time in a long time. After Richard Nixon signed the Controlled Substances Act in 1970, which put psilocybin and LSD in the same category as heroin and cocaine, the promising research into therapeutic uses for those drugs soon ground to a halt. The cultural moment had passed, and a new era of prohibition began. Griffiths picked up where the pioneers left off. A commentary that ran alongside his 2006 paper declared that the study “should make all scientists in human psychopharmacology sit up and take notice.”

Lots did. Type psilocybin into the database of ongoing trials and you’ll see more than a hundred (the same goes for LSD). Scientists are testing the drug as a remedy for a catalog of maladies such as depression, anorexia, post-traumatic stress, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. More than 50 publicly traded psychedelic companies have set up shop hoping to capitalize on what might be the new frontier in mental health. Meanwhile research centers are popping up like — what else? — mushrooms after a rainstorm, including at the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Wisconsin at Madison, and the University of Texas’ Dell Medical School, in Austin. Psychedelics are in the midst of what journalists inevitably refer to as a “renaissance.”

ADVERTISEMENT

How much of that is due to Griffiths’ paper? You might roll your eyes at a study that wouldn’t shock the average Grateful Dead fan. Or you could point out that giving Griffiths and his co-authors all the credit ignores other trailblazing research on psychedelics, notably by Rick Strassman at the University of New Mexico in the early 1990s. But it was Griffiths’ paper that really broke the ice. The results were attention-grabbing, and Griffiths had the necessary gravitas to overcome knee-jerk skepticism. He was a professor at a prestigious institution who had a reputation for being meticulous and strait-laced. One of his colleagues calls him the anti-Timothy Leary. In contrast to the infamous Harvard psychologist, Griffiths, who is 76, never escaped from prison with the aid of the Brotherhood of Eternal Love or inspired a generation to get stoned.

And yet they’re alike in other ways. Griffiths shares with Leary a belief in the potential of psychedelics to help us feel more empathy, to reflect on nature and our place in it, and perhaps to save us from ourselves. He’s raising millions of dollars to explore those big ideas despite the fact that, as he puts it, “my time is slipping away before my very eyes.”

M aybe it was a mid-life crisis, or at least a bout of professional ennui. By the mid-1990s, Griffiths was pushing 50 and had become a fixture in the psychiatry department at Johns Hopkins. He was checking all the boxes a researcher in his field was supposed to check, piling up publications, securing grants, mentoring graduate students. He was a successful academic by any measure, but his passion for the work itself had petered out. He was bored. “I was like ‘OK, what am I doing here? What meaning is to be derived from this?’” he says. “It didn’t feel important to me.”

Around then he rediscovered meditation. He had tried to meditate when he was younger but was too fidgety. Minutes felt like hours. This time, in part thanks to the encouragement of a girlfriend, it took. He started paying closer attention to the voice in his head, which he realized could be harshly self-critical. “What opened for me is this window of deep curiosity about inner knowing,” he says. “It’s about recognizing thoughts, emotions — feelings that emerge into the mind and appear within a larger framework of consciousness.”

Robert Carter for The Chronicle Roland Griffiths

He started mentioning meditation to colleagues, who mostly responded with polite nods and blank looks. He talked about it enough that word got around to Robert Jesse, founder of the Council on Spiritual Practices, a small nonprofit organization dedicated to “making direct experience of the sacred more available to more people.” Jesse had been trying to restart psychedelic research in the United States and wanted a scientist who could lead that effort. Griffiths didn’t know much about psychedelics and didn’t have any firsthand knowledge, with the exception of a forgettable experience in his youth — so forgettable that he’s not sure what he took. But the two shared an interest in meditation. Jesse encouraged him to read more about meditation traditions and also helped spark his interest in psychedelics. Griffiths delved into the literature from the ‘50s and ‘60s, the studies conducted back before psychedelics were demonized and dismissed.

The more he learned, the more intrigued he became. The early research, though not always up to modern standards, was serious and substantive. At Jesse’s encouragement, Griffiths met with William Richards, who was among the last researchers to perform a study using psilocybin. In the 1960s, Richards himself had been a subject in a psychedelic experiment and he wrote a paper on LSD and mysticism with Walter Pahnke, a Harvard-trained psychiatrist best known for the 1962 Good Friday study, in which divinity students were given psilocybin. Richards brought a rich background in the field. Griffiths had the academic bona fides. “We just liked each other and felt we could be a good team,” Richards recalls. They discussed a collaboration, one that would be funded in part by Jesse’s organization.

Griffiths was game, but several hurdles had to be cleared, including getting federal agencies to sign off. Johns Hopkins had to give its blessing as well, which he worried might be a problem. For the university, it was a public-relations risk. Sure, Griffiths and other psychopharmacologists worked with illegal substances routinely, but that was usually for research that dealt with addiction. This was different. Would Johns Hopkins be viewed as endorsing drug abuse? If something went wrong, would Griffiths and the university be seen as reckless?

Most of the subjects found the experience profoundly meaningful.

Many of his colleagues weren’t encouraging. First, Griffiths gets enamored with meditation, and now he wants to give people magic mushrooms? “When I told them I was interested in doing research on psychedelics, a number said, What are you thinking? Why would that be interesting?” he remembers. “Mostly it was like, That’s too weird or dangerous.” If given the chance, he felt certain some at the university would kill the project.

He and his co-authors, Richards, Jesse, and Una McCann, pressed ahead, and eventually received the necessary approvals. In the study, they gave some subjects a high dose of psilocybin and others a drug called niacin, which makes your face feel warm but not much else (a tricky aspect of psychedelic research is figuring out how not to reveal who has taken the real thing). Subjects were asked about their drug histories because the researchers wanted only those who hadn’t dabbled in psychedelics before. The scientists had each of them lie down on a couch, put on an eye-mask, and listen to classical music through headphones. Then they waited for the drug to kick in.

If you give someone a sizable amount of psilocybin, that person is going to get really high. That’s not a revelation. What was remarkable, however, was that most of the subjects found the experience profoundly meaningful. (A later study would find that subjects given psilocybin would still rate the experience as meaningful more than a year later.) Not everyone was equally effusive: Four of the 36 subjects suffered from anxiety or general unpleasantness during the entire session, and three said they never wanted to go through that again. Still, most of them said a single dose of psilocybin had a positive effect on their lives when researchers checked in with them again a couple of months later. “The results were just so astonishing,” Griffiths says. “It was unlike anything I’d ever worked with.”

When the study was published, it caused a minor media stir. The Economist‘s headline read “The God Pill,” though Griffiths would insist that psilocybin couldn’t prove or disprove the existence of the divine. Other stories sounded a cautionary note amid the general amazement. The New York Times stated that magic mushrooms had been a “stubborn part of the drug problem” and that those who partook could “warp their consciousness.” New Scientist quoted a psychiatrist who warned that psychedelics are “powerful agents that are just as likely to do harm as to do good.” Griffiths tamped down expectations, saying at the time that “therapeutic application is very speculative.”

But he was pleased. Thrilled, even. While it was only one study, and a small one at that, it had inserted psychedelics back into the mainstream conversation and nudged the research a bit closer to respectability. Harriet De Wit, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Chicago, and the editor of Psychopharmacology at the time, said Griffiths’s reputation as a solid, established researcher made pulling off the study possible, but she also notes that it came with risks. “It took some courage and initiative to get it going in the first place,” she says. “And he did it.” More personally, Griffiths was no longer weighing whether to hand in his resignation and embark on a life of yoga and inner contemplation: “If it had fallen on its face, I still might have ended up in the ashram.”

O ne study led to another. Griffiths, along with Katherine MacLean and Matthew Johnson, looked at whether psilocybin prompted subjects to feel more emotionally open (it did). In research co-authored with Johnson and Albert Garcia-Romeu, he found that psilocybin held promise as a treatment for nicotine addiction. In 2016, Griffiths and company published a paper examining whether psilocybin could help ease the depression and anxiety felt by patients with life-threatening cancer.

Griffiths went into the cancer study with trepidation. “I was really concerned that we could damage people with this kind of big, opening experience when they’re confronting their own mortality,” he says. Similar studies had been carried out decades before and found that psychedelics lessened psychological distress for patients. Griffiths’ study backed up those earlier findings and found that patients emerged feeling more at peace with their mortality. The positive effects remained evident six months later.

When they were conducting that study, Griffiths couldn’t imagine what those subjects were going through. Recently, though, Griffiths was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer. In the wake of that news, he stepped down as director of the university’s Center for Psychedelic & Consciousness Research, though he’s stayed active in its work. He likes to say he cut back from 70 hours a week to 40. He also married his longtime partner.

I spoke to Griffiths in the living room of his Baltimore home on a chilly February afternoon. On the day I saw him, he had just completed a round of chemotherapy and worried that he might not be sharp enough for an interview. In reality, he had no trouble speaking about his life and research for more than two hours, reflecting on his midcareer shift and where he thinks psychedelic research is headed. He also spoke about the prospect of his death. Shortly after the diagnosis, he felt what cancer patients understandably tend to feel: fear and sadness. But he’s made an effort to steer his thoughts toward acceptance and gratitude, and the result has been a kind of new awakening. “Who wants to be depressed or angry or resentful?” he says. “And going to war with it just really felt like the wrong posture.” Where he’s landed instead, he says, is in a place of “joy and equipoise and well-being I couldn’t have imagined would have emerged from a terminal-cancer diagnosis.”

He gives some of the credit to psychedelics. Before his diagnosis, he had been reluctant to mention his own drug use, preferring to keep the attention on the science. As a rule, psychedelic researchers either don’t discuss or else downplay personal use, lest they leave the impression that their enthusiasm is more than professional. “I haven’t had extensive experiences with psychedelics, but I’ve had enough to certainly encounter some very dark places,” he says. In the literature, those dark places are referred to as “challenging effects” — i.e., bad trips. He advises people who encounter troubling visions or negative emotions after taking a psychedelic to confront whatever’s upsetting them directly, to realize that it’s only in their minds. “If you see a demon and it’s frightening, you don’t want to run from it, and you don’t want to fight it, because in both cases you reify it,” he says. “You want to be curious about it.”

That’s the approach he’s taken with cancer. He’s curious about death, about the process of dying, and about what comes next, if anything. As a scientist, he remains firmly agnostic. “I can’t simply adopt a metaphysical worldview that says, ‘Oh yeah, this is all going to be great and I’ll end up in heaven,’” he says. “I’m way too much of a skeptic for that.” He doesn’t subscribe to any particular theory about the persistence of consciousness, but he’s open to the hope, slim though it might be, that there’s something more. As a meditator and occasional user of psychedelics, he’s familiar with a sense of transcendence, with glimpses of what seem to be other realities. “Where are we going? What happens when we die? We’re in the middle of this astonishing mystery,” he says. “The reflex I have is being in the mystery and awakening to the privilege of being embodied and having this experience we don’t understand.”

Not long after his diagnosis, Griffiths started working on his will. When he got to the prompt for charitable causes, he paused: What did he want to give? He considered endowing an annual lecture on psychedelics and “secular spirituality,” Griffiths’ term for mystical experiences minus theological implications. Then he got more ambitious. Perhaps he could set up a professorship that would focus on secular spirituality, one with an ample research budget. By his calculation, that would cost around $20 million if he wanted the professorship to continue in perpetuity. While he didn’t have that kind of money, what he did have was a fair amount of goodwill in the burgeoning psychedelics community. He’s the guy who ushered in the renaissance after all. He’s most of the way to that goal in donations and pledges, and he hopes to close that gap while he’s still around.

The emphasis will not be on the treatment of disease, though work in that vein will continue at the center. Instead he wants the project to take on basic, universal questions. “A bigger and more aspirational goal is the flourishing of mankind,” he says. Griffiths points to findings that suggest psychedelics can cause people to feel more empathy for one another and can engender a sense of connection to nature. The word “oneness” comes up frequently when people are asked to describe their trips. Griffiths fears that humanity may be hurtling toward disaster, listing bioweapons, climate change, and artificial intelligence as potentially “species terminating” problems on the horizon. The use of psychedelics has “really profound implications for our understanding of core ethical and moral beliefs, because a hallmark feature of these experiences is that we’re all in this together,” he says. “It opens people up to this sense that we have a commonality and that we need to take care of each other.”

Rescuing humanity from its self-destructive tendencies is a laudable goal, albeit one that doesn’t fit squarely within the scope of most psychiatry departments. Griffiths knew the project might be a hard sell, but it was crucial to him that the mission wasn’t watered down or hijacked. So he was careful about the terms for the professorship and “made clear that the endowment would not end up at Hopkins” unless his wishes were respected. In the end, he was satisfied that they were.

Psychedelics research is a means to studying something “more important, which is that our minds have the capacity to positively transform.”

Griffiths isn’t shy about making his case, no matter the subject. “He is going to determine what he thinks is important,” says James Potash, director of the Hopkins psychiatry department. “He was exactly the right person to lead the psychedelic renaissance because he would not be deterred by what anyone else thought.” I spoke to several colleagues who seconded that opinion. “There’s a side of Roland that can be a little pedantic, you know?” says Bill Richards, who continued to work with him after that first psilocybin study. “But it’s what makes a good researcher.” He’s also someone who revels in debate. David B. Yaden, an assistant professor at Hopkins and a co-author of the recent book The Varieties of Spiritual Experience: 21st Century Research and Perspectives, says he’s had marathon back-and-forths with Griffiths, sometimes wrestling over a single word (they’ve written several papers together). “He’s able to disagree agreeably to a remarkable extent,” Yaden says. “There’s rigor paired with radically open curiosity.”

Griffiths chose Yaden as the first recipient of the professorship. An overwhelming mystical episode Yaden had in college — for the record, not one elicited by any illicit substance — piqued his curiosity, and he devoted himself to understanding that seemingly inexplicable, yet surprisingly common, type of experience. He was told numerous times along the way that pursuing psychedelics, mysticism, and well-being as research topics was tantamount to career suicide. “I think Roland and I share a kind of agnosticism in regards to those questions about the ultimate nature of reality and consciousness,” Yaden says. “In an important sense, it’s not about psychedelics. They’re the means to study something else I think is more important, which is that our minds have the capacity to positively transform.”

They also share a concern about psychedelic hype. Back in 2006, the difficulty was getting people to take psychedelics seriously, to at least consider whether claims made about their beneficial qualities might be valid. Now there’s a psychedelic industry made up of companies with names like Compass Pathways and MindMed betting that at least a few of these compounds will wend their way through the regulatory process and make it to market. This year’s South by Southwest conference featured sessions including “Psychedelics & the Next Economy” and “The Future of Psychedelics: Culture vs. Capitalism.” Prince Harry, Aaron Rodgers, and other celebrities have spoken openly and positively about their use of psychedelics. The tone in journalism has increasingly shifted from alarmism to normalization. A recent article in The Washington Post explained “Why some moms are microdosing mushrooms for anxiety and depression,” while the The New Yorker asked, “Can Psychedelics Heal Ukranians’ Trauma?”

Griffiths and Yaden, along with Potash, published an opinion piece last summer in JAMA Psychiatry, arguing that researchers need to better understand the promise of psychedelics while remaining wary of over-the-top claims. The truth is that some recent studies have had mixed results, and psychedelics don’t work well for everyone. “We encourage our colleagues to help deflate the psychedelic hype bubble in a measured way so that we can get on with the hard work of more precisely determining the risks and benefits of psychedelics,” they wrote.

W hen people ask Griffiths what he believes, about psychedelics or pretty much anything else, he borrows a line from a colleague: “I believe in the data.” For years, he’s given subjects in his studies, and some visitors to his house, a small medallion that he had made. It features an image of magic mushrooms. Before he hands it to the person, he asks “Are you aware that you are aware?,” a question he believes is at the core of spirituality. On the medallion is a quote from the poet William Blake: “The true method of knowledge is experiment,” a line that Griffiths takes to mean both scientific and personal research.

He didn’t begin his personal research into psychedelics until he had been studying them for years. One reason is that he didn’t know where to obtain the drugs, an irony considering that he had administered psychedelics to hundreds of subjects. His inaugural experience wasn’t with psilocybin, but instead with 2C-B, a compound that was synthesized in the 1970s by Alexander Shulgin, a legendary chemist and psychopharmacologist. Griffiths took a small dose just before a meditation session. Like any good scientist, he made sure to have pen and paper on hand so he could record his reaction. What he wrote down was: “It’s all true.”","['Robert Carter For The Chronicle', 'Tom Bartlett Is A Senior Writer Who Covers Science', 'Ideas. Follow Him On Twitter']",2023-04-10 19:12:17.119000

Grace Berger was selected seventh overall Monday night in the 2023 WNBA Draft by the Indiana Fever.

Berger played five seasons at Indiana, starting 118 games ‒ including all of her appearances starting as a sophomore ‒ as the Hoosiers went from a Big Ten upstart to a national contender.

She finished her IU career with a 16.0-point scoring average and 1,841 points (fourth), 752 rebounds (fifth), 573 assists (second) and 170 steals (seventh). Berger was a four-time All-Big Ten honoree and an honorable mention All-American in 2023.

""I loved being a Hoosier, every single second of it. It's the best decision I've ever made,"" Berger said after the Hoosiers' NCAA tournament loss to Miami. ""Coach (Teri) Moren is someone who's going to impact me far more than just my five years here. I love this program, I love this university, I love my coaches, I love my teammates.""

Fever coach Christie Sides on Berger: “She’s going to get out and do whatever is needed for her team. … Those are the kind of people we want in this locker room and on the court.” #iuwbb pic.twitter.com/MA8axO3P4j — hank 🇰🇷 (@Brian_Haenchen) April 10, 2023

Grace Berger's goodbye: Coach says Berger is the best possible teammate

Where is Grace Berger from?

She is from Louisville, Ky. She played at Sacred Heart, where she had 1,886 points and 988 rebounds, and was a Kentucky All-Star in 2018.

Grace Berger WNBA Draft profile

M.A. Voepel, ESPN: 9th to the Seattle Storm

Berger is the type of gritty, determined, highly motivated player coaches love. But she's not just blue-collar good, she's very skilled. Berger hasn't shot the 3-ball as much as some other top guards, but she has the work ethic to add things to her game at the pro level. And she could help the Storm reshape their identity after Sue Bird's retirement and Breanna Stewart's departure in free agency.

""One of the things I love about Grace is her ability to play three positions,"" said Indiana Fever executive Lin Dunn. ""She can play the 2, the 1, the 3. She's physically strong, tough.""

Jack Maloney, CBS Sports: 9th

Berger's final season with the Hoosiers ended in disappointing fashion with a second-round loss to Miami in the NCAA Tournament, but her 17 points, six rebounds and six assists in that game were another reminder of her strong all-around game. Though Berger may not have the upside of some other prospects, she's a big, versatile guard who doesn't make many mistakes. The Storm can use all of those skills as they try to rebuild following Breanna Stewart's departure and Sue Bird's retirement.

Rachel Galligan, Just Women's Sports: 7th to the Indiana Fever

The Indiana Fever could go in a number of different directions with this pick. Beyond the sentiment of keeping Hoosiers star Grace Berger in state, the 6-0 guard has the “it” factor as a tough and disciplined competitor. Berger is as steady as they come at the guard spot and has elevated her play in the biggest moments this season. She is one of the most composed players in the 2023 class.

While Indiana’s roster looks a bit guard-heavy at first glance, Berger would bring a unique skill set with her mid-range efficiency and her ability to play on or off the ball and rebound from the guard spot. Berger is averaging a career-best 5.8 assists per game for Indiana this season, and while she’s not known for her 3-point shot, she’s been efficient when she’s taken them, averaging 40 percent from range. Her experience and on-court leadership would be welcome on the Fever’s young, rebuilding roster.

One All-American collapsed to the floor of Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall as soon as the final buzzer sounded, signaling the end of the season. Another All-American kept her composure until reaching the locker room, but the tears fell nonetheless.

Both were equally heartbroken, but for different reasons. For one, it was the final game of her Indiana career. For the other, it was the last game with one of her best friends.

“Obviously I’m upset,” Mackenzie Holmes said, through tears, after Indiana’s 70-68 loss to No. 9 Miami in the 2023 NCAA tournament. “You know, my last game with Grace (Berger). It’s been a privilege to play with her for these last four years. I just hate that it has to end like this for her.”

Grace Berger and Mackenzie Holmes are the duo that represent Indiana women’s basketball — they have been for the entire season. They were the team’s leaders in every sense of the word, and it was never going to be any different, not until the season was over and things had to be.

So it was no surprise that the pair of All-Americans headlined Indiana’s final game of the 2022-23 season. In Monday night’s loss, Holmes and Berger combined for 39 points and 15 of the Hoosiers’ 29 rebounds.

They spoke calmly to their teammates and each other, let out yells and pumped their fists after success and worked as hard as they could to win the game.

But it wasn’t enough, and Berger’s career ended in the same place it began.

“I loved being a Hoosier, every single second of it,” Berger said. “It was the best decision I’ve ever made.”

The graduate student has a storied history as a Hoosier; the program had little success to point to when she joined five years ago. But Berger saw the potential in Teri Moren, just as Moren saw in her, and the two joined forces to create what would end up being the best three years in Indiana women’s basketball history.

“(I’m) just so grateful that she decided to be an Indiana Hoosier five years ago,” Moren said. “When she had a lot of different options, she chose us. And we’re so grateful, and again, she’s going to be one of the very best to put on a uniform.”

Berger helped lead the Hoosiers to three consecutive NCAA tournaments in her time. An Elite Eight, a Sweet Sixteen and, to close it out, an appearance in the round of 32. But while some would be pleased by that, Berger and the rest of her team are not.

They had championship aspirations and believed they had a real shot at getting there. A loss in the round of 32 was not what they wanted or expected from themselves. A loss like Monday’s — one that came down to the buzzer and showcased just how much fight the Hoosiers had — was the last thing they wanted to endure.

So while Berger will go down in history as one of the best players to grace the floor of Assembly Hall, it’ll take some time for her to be okay with that.

“I’m sad that it’s ending, but I’m just very grateful that it’s happened,” Berger said. “There’s no reason that Indiana women’s basketball shouldn’t be a blue blood, a top team in the country every single year. I just hope that the work I did with my teammates hopefully impacts that.”

There are many nicknames for Berger, but one of the most well-known — and perhaps the best — is the “heart and soul” of Indiana basketball. Whether she was calmly directing play on the court, cheering with her teammates or being her typical introverted self off the court, Berger touched the hearts and souls of everyone around her, and in doing so, became the representative of them all.

“My first two years of college basketball, I was really lost,” Sydney Parrish said. “She was a big reason why I came here. She makes everyone around her better, and she’s a big reason why a lot of girls want to come here and play basketball now.”

Everyone who was a part of the 2022-23 Indiana women’s basketball team was impacted by Berger — there’s no doubt about that. From transfers like Parrish to freshmen like Yarden Garzon, everyone benefited from the guard’s stoic personality.

But few, perhaps, benefitted as much as Holmes.

The two combined for “buddy ball” down low more often than not, and they saw each other grow in their times as Hoosiers. Holmes saw Berger grow into the confident, muscled-up point guard she is now, and Berger saw Holmes become one of the best post players in the country.

Without each other, it’s possible the two might not be who they are today. Indiana women’s basketball definitely wouldn’t be.

“She is the best teammate, and she is just the most coachable kid,” Moren said. “She has a very businesslike approach, and that — because of who she is, she touches so many people.”

Berger will leave Indiana with a host of awards, statistics and titles to her name. Those who watched her, played with her and coached her will all remember different things about her. But no matter what, they will all know one thing: without Berger, Indiana basketball would not be itself.

“She’s helped build this program,” Moren said. “We’re not sitting here where we are today, we weren’t sitting here a year ago, probably three years ago, without Grace Berger on this roster.”

https://www.musicradar.com/news/roland-zenology-pro-2,Roland’s Zenology Pro plugin hits version 2.0: more sounds and a refined user interface,"Zenology Pro is the plugin home for Roland’s flagship Zen-Core synthesis engine, which is used to power its finest software and hardware synths. It’s now been updated to version 2.0, which adds a variety of new features.

For a start, there are now 500 additional presets, while the refined user interface promises a new structure view, click-and-drag resizing, visual feedback and more. Zenology Pro’s rather dated-looking and inflexible GUI was one of the things we criticised in our review, so here’s hoping that this redesign will help to improve the software’s workflow.

Other enhancements include a fully integrated browser view and a new reverb section with eight distinct algorithms.

Elsewhere, the fundamentals of Zenology Pro remain in place. You start with 4,000 tones and 200 drum kits, expandable to a total of more than 10,000 via sound packs and Wave Expansions on the Roland Cloud. Each tone can be made up of up to four partials, each of which has an oscillator, filter, amplifier, dual LFOs and equaliser.

The synth explores a variety of synthesis types, including PCM, virtual analogue, PCM Sync - a choice of PCM waves that allow for oscillator sync between Partials - Supersaw and Noise. There are 10 filter types, eleven LFO shapes (including tempo-synced Step LFOs with 37 curves per step) and more than 90 effects, some of which are inspired by classic hardware from the Roland archive.

If you own Zen-Core hardware, meanwhile, the good news is that sounds are exchangeable between that and Zenology Pro. Current Zen-Core offerings include the Fantom and Jupiter-X ranges, Juno-X, RD-88, MC-101, MC-707 and more.

Zenology Pro 2.0 is available as part of a Roland Cloud Pro ($10/month) or Ultimate ($20/month) subscription.

https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/36/5/319,Berger in retrospect: effect of varied weight training programmes on strength,"There is a pervasive misconception that multiple sets of a strength training exercise are superior to a single set for increasing muscular size and strength. The prevalent recommendation, which appears in exercise physiology textbooks and strength training reviews, is to perform multiple sets (at least three) of each exercise. However, there is very little evidence to support the preponderant belief that multiple sets are superior to a single set. Fig 1⇓ illustrates the labyrinth of cross referencing by physiologists who recommend the execution of multiple sets. The only evidence cited to support their multiple set training philosophy is one strength training study by Berger,1 which is perhaps the genesis of the unsubstantiated belief that multiple sets are required for optimal gains in strength. Therefore, a close examination of this study is warranted. This retrospective is based on the original information published in Berger's study,1 as well as personal written and telephone correspondence (1998) with Dr Berger in which he clarified specific methodologies that were not elucidated in the original publication. He expressed his opinion—both before his research and currently—that multiple sets are required for maximal increases in muscular strength and hypertrophy (personal communication; 1998).

Figure 1 Cross referencing by physiologists who recommend the execution of multiple sets.

BERGER (1962) Berger1 reported that nine groups of college age men (about 20 in each group) performed strength training exercises three times a week for 12 weeks. The students (n = 177) were enrolled in one of nine weight training classes and not equated or randomised before training. There was no control group. In addition to their regular weight training programme, which is not described in the report,1 participants performed different combinations of sets and repetitions in the free weight bench press exercise—for example, three sets of six repetitions (III-6). Berger1 used roman and arabic numerals to represent sets and repetitions respectively. All nine groups showed a significant increase (p<0.05) in one repetition maximum (1RM) bench press (table 1⇓). Table 1 Significant increase (p<0.05) in one repetition maximum (1RM) bench press for all nine groups after 12 weeks of training Berger's1 Table 4⇓ (p 176) had three previously unchallenged typographical errors. The errors have been corrected (row 6, column 5 changed from III-2 to I-6; row 2, column 9 changed from III-6 to Groups; and row 3, column 9 changed from Groups to III-6), and the results for the end of 12 weeks of training are presented here in table 2⇓ (personal communication; 1998). Berger1 notes that groups differing at the 0.05 level are separated by dashes. Table 2⇓ shows which of Berger's1 nine groups (36 comparisons) differ significantly and those that do not. After 12 weeks of training, group III-6 is separated by dashes from II-6, but not from I-6. Similarly, group III-2 is separated by dashes from II-2 but not from I-2. That is, the increase in 1RM bench press for the III-6 group was significantly greater (p<0.05) than for the II-6 group, but not significantly greater than for the I-6 group. The II-6 group is not separated by dashes from the I-6 group. Likewise, the increase in strength for group III-2 was significantly greater (p<0.05) than for the II-2 group but not significantly greater than for the I-2 group. The II-2 group is not separated by dashes from the I-2 group. If a greater number of sets were really better than fewer sets, three sets would be better than one set, as well as better than two sets—they were not. There was no significant difference in 1RM between groups I-10 and II-10, groups I-10 and III-10, or groups II-10 and III-10. Table 3⇓ shows that seven out of nine of Berger's1 comparisons between groups who performed the same number of repetitions (2, 6, or 10) showed no significant difference in the magnitude of strength gains as a result of performing single or multiple sets. Whenever multiple comparison testing is used, the chance of making a type I error is increased—that is, rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is actually true. Perhaps the differences that Berger1 reported were due to chance or random error (personal communication; 1998). Table 2 Bench press one repetition maximum (1RM) for the nine groups after 12 weeks of training Table 3 Comparison of groups performing a similar number of repetitions (2, 6, or 10) after 12 weeks Berger1 also compared the results of training with one, two, or three sets by combining the nine groups according to the number of sets performed. Training with either one set or two sets produced similar improvements in strength (22.3% and 22.0% respectively), whereas training with three sets elicited an increase of 25.5%. The difference (3.2%) between training with one set and three sets was significant (p<0.05) after 12 weeks of training. If it is assumed that the difference was not caused by random error, the practical significance of a 1.8 kg difference as a result of performing three sets compared with one set (from Figure 2 of Berger's study1) is questionable (personal communication; 1998). That is, for most of the strength training population and with the exception of elite strength athletes, a 3% difference in strength may not be worth 300% greater time and energy expenditure. Berger1 reported that the greatest difference in the rate of improvement between the combined one set, two set, and three set groups occurred during the second three weeks (weeks 4–6) of training. During this period the increase was 5.0%, 5.7%, and 7.8%, for the one, two, and three set groups respectively. Perhaps there was a greater learning effect for the combined three set groups in the early phase of the study. A movement such as the free weight bench press exercise, which requires a high level of strength, is considered a skilled act, and control of the involved muscles by the nervous system is very complex. Therefore, when an unfamiliar exercise is introduced, the increase in strength is largely because of adaptations in the nervous system that optimise control of the muscles involved in the exercise and the coordination necessary to perform the exercise efficiently. These neural adaptations are predominant in the first few weeks of training.2 For the rest of the 12 week study (weeks 7–12), the difference between groups gradually diminished until the rate of improvement was practically the same during the last three weeks of training. In fact, the rate of improvement for weeks 9–12 was 4.0%, 3.2%, and 3.3% for the one, two, and three set groups respectively. Similarly, for the specific number of repetitions (six) that Berger1 claimed to be optimal, the rate of strength increase for the last three weeks was 4.8%, 3.0%, and 4.0% for group I-6, II-6, and III-6 respectively. In the Results section, Berger1 claims that more sets, more repetitions per set, and more total repetitions at each training session resulted in a greater improvement in strength. His implication is that three sets of ten repetitions (III-10)—the greatest volume of exercise—is the most effective. However, contrary to Berger's1 claim, table 2⇑ shows that there was a significantly (p<0.05) greater increase in strength for subjects in the III-6 group (29.6%), who performed 18 repetitions per session, compared with subjects in the III-10 group (23.0%), who performed 30 repetitions per session. Berger1 used an analysis of covariance to test for any significant interaction between sets and repetitions—that is, whether one, two, or three sets might be better systematically in combination with two, six, or ten repetitions. The F ratio for interaction was not significant at any period of training (3, 6, 9, or 12 weeks). In Conclusion 6, Berger1 contends that training with one, two, or three sets in discrete combination with two, six, or ten repetitions (interaction) was not systematically more effective in improving strength than other combinations. However, in Conclusion 7, he declares that a combination of six repetitions and three sets was more effective in improving strength than any other combination of sets and repetitions.1 Berger1 reports no significant interaction, and then antithetically claims that the combination of three sets and six repetitions is more effective than any other combination of sets and repetitions. Berger's1 subjects were enrolled in weight training classes. They all performed and were graded on other exercises besides the bench press (personal communication; 1998). However, Berger1 reported only the results of the bench press exercise. He did not control the number of sets and repetitions performed for the other weight training exercises (personal communication; 1998), and those exercises involving the triceps, pectorals, and deltoids may have confounded the results of the 1RM bench press. Participants chose their own rest time between sets and exercises (personal communication; 1998). Although the optimal rest time between sets or exercises is unknown, similar rest between sets would have eliminated recovery time as a confounding variable. Berger1 did not control for the speed of movement, which was self selected by each participant (personal communication; 1998). Different speeds of movement within and among the nine groups may have affected his results. Participants were given enough assistance to accomplish a specific number of repetitions (2, 6, or 10). The amount of assistance, the specific spotter for each participant, the number of assisted repetitions, and how often the assisted repetitions were applied in each group for each participant were neither controlled nor documented (personal communication; 1998). When a subject thought that he could perform more than the designated number of repetitions, he terminated the set at the designated number and increased the weight at the next session (personal communication; 1998)—that is, participants did not exceed the designated number of repetitions (2, 6, or 10). Completing every set to muscular fatigue would have ensured similar maximal exercise intensity (effort) for everyone. Because the sets were terminated at a specific number of repetitions, there was no control for exercise intensity (degree of effort or fatigue) within or among the groups. The concept of muscular fatigue is highly subjective and not universally defined or fully understood. As fatigue begins to develop within the muscle as a result of several submaximal muscle actions, more motor units are recruited and motor unit firing rates increase in an attempt to maintain the desired force output. When the force generating capacity drops below the required force, despite full recruitment and optimal firing rates of motor units, it is generally defined as muscular fatigue.3 The causes may range from motivation to maintain voluntary effort to failure in the contractile mechanism. The various processes that cause fatigue during high intensity strength training may provide the stimulus for increased strength.4 It is speculated that the degree of motor unit activation determines the magnitude of the strength training response and that intensity is the most contributing factor for increasing strength.4,6

BERGER (1963) If three sets of six repetitions (3 × 6) were superior to other training protocols, subsequent studies would have replicated those results. However, a follow up study by Berger7 failed to support his conclusion that 3 × 6 is the best training protocol. He trained three groups of young men three times a week for nine weeks performing a 3 × 6 (n = 14), 3 × 10 (n = 19), or 6 × 2 (n = 15) protocol in the free weight bench press exercise. All groups showed a significant (p<0.001) increase in 1RM bench press (21.3%, 20.0%, and 16.9% respectively), with no significant difference among the groups. That is, the 3 × 6 protocol was not superior to the 3 × 10 protocol. In Berger's previous investigation,1 he reported that the 3 × 6 protocol showed a significantly greater increase in 1RM bench press than the 3 × 10 protocol. Berger7 concluded that further research was required to determine the optimum combination of sets and repetitions for the greatest improvement of strength. In a summary of his strength training research, Berger8 recommends executing at least three sets at each session. He cites his 1962 study1 in support of his high volume training philosophy.

BERGER (1972) Berger9 trained three groups of young men three times a week for eight weeks. They performed one (n = 57), two (n = 20), or three sets (n = 20) of static bench press exercise by attempting to raise an immovable bar with a maximum effort for 6–8 seconds at two positions (with the bar on the chest and at 90° elbow flexion). There was a significant (p<0.01) increase in dynamic 1RM bench press strength for the one, two, and three set groups (19.8%, 15.4%, and 21.7% respectively), with no significant difference among the groups. Berger9 concluded that training with one, two, or three sets produces approximately the same improvement in dynamic strength. However, he subsequently recommended performing at least three to five sets,10 substantiated only by his 1962 study.1

DISCUSSION “There is very little peer reviewed evidence to support a high volume strength training protocol.” In his book Conditioning for men, Berger11 recommends performing three to five sets of each exercise for optimal strength, and in his Introduction to weight training,12 he recommends performing five to nine sets of each exercise. In his textbook Applied exercise physiology,13 Berger claims that three sets are more effective than fewer sets for maximising strength. The only reference that Berger cites in the aforementioned books11,13 is his 1962 strength training study.1 Berger still believes that a great volume of exercise is required for optimal strength gains (personal communication; 1998). However, there is very little peer reviewed evidence to support a high volume strength training protocol. Despite the numerous confounding variables that obfuscate Berger's1 results, dozens of physiologists continue to cite his study in an attempt to support their unsubstantiated multiple set strength training doctrine. If the multiple set training philosophy—the volume theory—were a valid training concept, the results of Berger's1 study would have been replicated in most of the subsequent research—and they have not. There are 57 studies,7,9,14–,68 albeit many with potentially confounding variables, that show no statistically significant difference in the magnitude of strength gains or muscular hypertrophy (whenever measured) as a result of performing a greater number of sets (table 4⇓). The studies in table 4⇓ involved trained and untrained men and women of various ages, performing a variety of exercises for different muscle groups, with machines and free weights, for durations up to six months. The primary purpose in 17 of the studies16,18,25,27,34 was to evaluate particular health benefits of strength training and not specifically investigate the effect of single versus multiple sets on strength. Although statistical comparisons of the average strength gains were not reported, the results of performing two sets for each of three lower body exercises and one set for each of eight upper body exercises were almost identical in these studies (38.2% and 42.6% respectively). The results are consistent with a threshold theory,6 rather than a volume theory. That is, it appears that for adaptations to occur, such as increased muscular strength and hypertrophy, the stimulus needs to be applied only once each session. Table 4 Studies reporting no significant difference in strength gains as a result of performing a greater number of sets Two criticisms of many strength training studies—inherent in Berger's1 study as well (personal communication; 1998)—are that they are poorly controlled or recruited untrained participants, or both. However, some recent studies have appropriately addressed these criticisms. For example, in a very well controlled study, Starkey et al51 randomly assigned healthy untrained men and women (18–50 years of age) to a one set (n = 18), three set (n = 20), or control (n = 10) group. Both training groups performed 8–12 repetitions to volitional fatigue using a two second concentric and four second eccentric protocol for dynamic bilateral knee extension and knee flexion exercises on two MedX strength machines three times a week for 14 weeks. They did not participate in any other form of training for the duration of the study. The three set group rested for one to three minutes between sets. Resistance was increased about 5% at the subsequent session when 12 or more repetitions were completed in good form. All sessions were monitored by the investigators, and the amount of resistance, number of repetitions, and rating of perceived exertion were recorded after each set. Peak knee extension torque at seven angles significantly increased (p<0.05) in both the one set (18–36%) and three set (13–27%) groups. Peak knee flexion torque at the same angles increased (p<0.05) in both the one set (13–35%) and three set (8–41%) groups. There was no significant difference between the one set and three set groups in either knee extension or knee flexion peak torque. Both groups had similar significant increases (p<0.01) in dynamic training resistance for both exercises. Ultrasound scans showed a significant increase (p<0.01) in muscle thickness, with no significant difference between the one set and three set groups. Hass et al41 randomly assigned 42 male and female recreational weightlifters (20–50 years of age), with an average of 6.2 years of strength training experience, to one of two training groups: one set (n = 21) or three set (n = 21). All participants were previously using the one set protocol (one circuit of nine exercises) three times a week. The one set group continued to perform one set of each exercise and the three set group performed three sets of each exercise on the nine MedX machines three times a week for 13 weeks. They executed each set of 8–12 repetitions using a two second concentric and four second eccentric protocol to volitional fatigue. Subjects rested one minute between exercises and three to five minutes between circuits. The investigators monitored each training session and recorded the resistance, number of repetitions, and rating of perceived exertion after each exercise. When 12 or more repetitions were completed in strict form, the resistance was increased 5–10% at the next session. Dynamic muscular strength was assessed using the 1RM on five of the nine MedX machines, as well as maximal isometric knee extension and knee flexion strength on a MedX ergometer. Seven skinfolds and six circumferences were assessed to estimate body composition. After 13 weeks, both groups showed a significant increase (p<0.05) in dynamic 1RM strength (8–14%) on the five exercises, with no significant difference in the magnitude of strength between the one set and three set groups. Both groups significantly increased (p<0.05) maximal isometric knee extension and knee flexion torque, with no significant difference between groups. Lean body mass significantly increased (p<0.05) in both groups, with no significant difference between groups. There were originally 49 subjects in this strength training study,41 but five had to be removed by the investigators because of poor compliance, and two other participants withdrew because of injuries. All seven subjects who did not complete the study were from the three set group. The greater volume of exercise (multiple sets) in the three set group may have contributed to their lower compliance.",['R N Carpinelli'],2002-10-01 00:00:00

She was about 30 minutes removed from her final game at Assembly Hall, a second-round NCAA Tournament game against 9th-seeded Miami. This was meant to be a joyous occasion, a celebratory send-off for one of the best in program history and the next step in IU’s quest for a national championship.

But that’s not the case.

Berger is in tears, quietly being comforted by a staff member. Sydney Parrish cries in front of her locker to the right; Chloe Moore-McNeil can be heard sobbing in the shower. Teammates are scattered around the room, sitting in stunned silence following a heartbreaking 70-68 loss to the Hurricanes.

A season destined to end in Dallas — or, at worst, next weekend in South Carolina — was brought crashing down in Bloomington.

Indiana's Chloe Moore-McNeil (22), Mackenzie Holmes (54), Grace Berger (34) and Yarden Garzon (12) react to the loss after the second half of the NCAA Tournament Second Round game between Indiana and Miami (FL) at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall on Monday, March 20, 2023.

""I knew it was eventually going to come to an end. It was inevitable,"" Berger said. ""I loved being a Hoosier, every single second of it. It's the best decision I've ever made. Coach Moren is someone who's going to impact me far more than just my five years here. I love this program, I love this university, I love my coaches, I love my teammates. It's sad that it's ending, but I'm very grateful that it happened.""

That's Grace Berger.

Known for her stoic demeanor, Berger is the best teammate anyone could ever ask for, coach Teri Moren said, praising her coachability and competitive spirit. ""We're not sitting here where we are today without Grace Berger. I'm so glad she chose us.""

""Grace Berger, she's a beast on the court, but during practices and those little moments, she's super supportive,"" said Geary, a grad transfer from Providence. ""Whenever I didn't get something right away, she was always there to pick me up, and help me out. She's such an amazing player, but it was so nice and comforting to have her pick you up in that way.""

In basketball terms, Berger was an electrifying presence at the dawn of a golden era in Indiana women's basketball. Responsible for the program's first-ever triple-double her sophomore season, she entered Monday's contest with the second-most assists and ninth-most points in program history.

Story continues

Indiana's Grace Berger (34) shoots over Miami (FL)'s Haley Cavinder (14) during the first half of the NCAA Tournament Second Round game between Indiana and Miami (FL) at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall on Monday, March 20, 2023.

Miami coach Katie Meier compared her to Dwyane Wade prior to the game, then to Dirk Nowitzki afterwards. ""She's really that good,"" Meier said.

With Berger's individual performances came wins (117, to be exact, plus appearances in the Elite 8 and Sweet 16), and with success came a rise in attendance. IU averaged 3,920 fans per game in Berger's freshman season. It averaged over 7,700 this year, with a record 17,222 in attendance for senior day vs. Purdue.

Monday's game was played in front of 14,480 fans, making it the second-largest crowd in program history.

This was the vision Moren pitched to Berger during the recruiting process, a chance to help build a powerhouse while representing a state whose motto is: ""In 49 other states it's just basketball.""

""I hope it's the norm and I think it will be,"" Berger said. ""We have great fans and part of the reason I wanted to come here was to help build that fanbase to be what it is on the men's side. I want that to be part of my legacy, that they keep coming back and supporting this program because it's something super special.""

When being recruited to IU, Berger was pitched on the idea of competing in the Final Four. That concept seemed surreal, a pipe dream, at the time, she admits, but IU came close the past two seasons and was on the doorstep once again this year.

That's why Monday's outcome felt so unbelievably unfair.

Indiana dug itself a massive hole in the first half, then rallied within striking distance in the third quarter — a charge spearheaded by All-American forward Mackenzie Holmes, who'd missed the first round game against Tennessee Tech due to knee soreness — before engaging Miami in a heavyweight boxing match in the fourth quarter.

The visitors led by three with seven seconds remaining, when IU — which had erased a five-point deficit moments earlier — tied the score at 68 on a stepback 3-pointer from the top of the arc by freshman Yarden Garzon, with a behind-the-back assist from Berger.

""That shows what kind of player Grace is, 12 seconds left and she throws a behind-the-back pass to a freshman,"" Parrish said, smiling softly. ""It also shows how special a player Yarden is, making big plays like that as a freshman.""

Indiana's Grace Berger (34) drives on Miami (FL)'s Haley Cavinder (14) during the first half of the NCAA Tournament Second Round game between Indiana and Miami (FL) at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall on Monday, March 20, 2023.

It was a clutch shot, one Garzon had the confidence to deliver thanks in large part to Berger.

""I think all season she did a really good job believing, no matter what the situation or moment was. Even when we were down, she always believed in us,"" Garzon said of Berger, adding she's the best player she's ever played with (high-praise considering she's played with WNBA players).

Unfortunately, Miami had the last laugh.

Coming out of a timeout, the Hurricanes threw the ball to Destiny Harden in the lane. The forward stepped to her left, then pulled back and swung back to her right, jumping straight up from the middle of the lane. Harden lofted a shot over Berger's outstretched arm. The orange sphere rolled across the rim, bounced gently off the back of the basket and fell through.

On a spring from the subsequent inbounds, Chloe Moore-McNeil lost control of the ball, the buzzer sounded and the celebration was on for Miami.

Thirty minutes later, Parrish is taking her turn with reporters. Berger sits slightly angled away from her, a towel draped over her head.

Can you put into words what's going through your head, sitting next to her right now?

Parrish, a Hamilton Southeastern grad and the lone in-state product on IU's roster, is immediately overcome by emotion, struck by the finality of the loss, the journey that led her to transfer from Oregon to Indiana over the summer and the role Berger played in reigniting her love for the game.

She takes a couple seconds to collect herself, then tearfully crafts a thoughtful, poignant response.

""I didn't know one player could have so much impact, that one school could have so much impact on me as a basketball player,"" Parrish says. ""I was so lost before coming here. I didn't like basketball. And I love it again. And it's because of Indiana basketball. It's because of these girls.""

As Parrish pauses once more, Berger reaches over and pats her on the leg, silently offering her teammate support as she continues.

Parrish made it to a Sweet 16 with Oregon, but she wasn't happy. ""I'd rather be here and lose in the second round, and be happy. I love it here, I love these girls, I love this staff.""

""It breaks my heart that this is the last time I've played with Grace and Alyssa (Geary),"" Parrish says. ""I can't wait to see Grace play at the next level, because she's so good. Anyone who's her teammate in the future is going to be beyond lucky to have someone who's as great as a person and as a player as she is.""

As the open locker room session neared its conclusion, giving those involved time to properly grieve and cherish their final moments together as teammates, Moren fielded one last question about her star player in the media workroom.

""She touches everybody in their own way because of who she is as a human being,"" Moren said. ""She's one of the very best to ever put on a uniform and I can't wait to see what's next for her. … That's why they're so emotional about her, because she means so much to all of us.""

Here’s the full release on Berger’s selection, via IU media relations:

NEW YORK CITY – Former Indiana guard Grace Berger was selected in the first round as the overall No. 7 pick in the WNBA Draft on Monday night by the Indiana Fever.

Berger becomes the program’s highest overall selection into the draft and fifth overall in school history. The Hoosiers have had players selected in back-to-back seasons for the first time ever, as Ali Patberg was picked as the 33rd overall selection to the Indiana Fever in 2022. Other players selected in the WNBA Draft include Jori Davis (2011, 33rd pick, Indiana Fever), Jill Chapman (2002, 21st pick, Detroit Shock) and Quacy Barnes (1998, 22nd pick, Sacramento Monarchs).

The Louisville, Ky. native finished her historic five-year Indiana career with 1,841 points, 573 assists and 752 rebounds. She ranks seventh all-time in scoring and second in all-time assists. She averaged 12.4 points, 5.1 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 1.1 steals and shot 45.2 percent from the floor in her career. Berger played in 148 career games, making 118 career starts and is the all-time winningest player in school history with 118 career victories and holds a 74.6 career win percentage and 83.1 percent in games inside Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall.

Berger finished her IU career as a four-time All-Big Ten first team honoree and USWBA and WBCA All-American honorable mention in 2022-23. In 24 games, the Louisville, Ky. native averaged 12.9 points, 5.8 assists and 4.8 rebounds per game while shooting 48.4 percent from the field, 40 percent from 3-point range and 75.7 percent at the free throw line. She scored in double figures 18 times including a season-high 26 points in the win over Iowa. A player who does a little bit of everything, Berger has dished out multiple assists in 21 games and averages 1.0 steals per outing while holding a +2.3 assist-to-turnover ratio. She collected three double-doubles this year including two on the road at then No. 11/4 Tennessee and in a win at Ohio State while also having the first point/assist double-double for the program since 2017.",[],2023-04-10 00:00:00

Most of these wines smell and taste like grape juice and have seductive alcohols that give the wines a richness and softness that mask astringent tannins. They’re more like grape-flavored milkshakes than wine.

Ultimately, many of today’s Cab buyers see young Cab as simply tasty, sort of like a coffee drink with five shots of hazelnut flavoring.

Buried in that last sentence is a word that’s key to why most of these red wines are so boring to those of us old enough to remember what drew us to classic, savory red wine in the first place, decades ago.

That secret word is “simply.” The antonym is complexly. Simple, young red wines don’t have much if any complexity. Nor are they interesting as savory dinner table companions. They’re like mates who have nothing to contribute to a dialogue. They are not multifaceted. They’re a one-note samba.

A key reason today’s younger wine lovers have little to no experience with older red wines is that they’ve never tried them. Most such wines are either too expensive or unavailable. Left with young, unaged reds, younger buyers have no experience with the most sublime wines that made Napa famous in the 1960s and ’70s.

Roughly 15 years ago, I mused about some of my most treasured experiences with mature red wines. I pulled that article from the archives, and I realized I had missed a few key points about why these wines were so interesting.

It was based on earlier harvesting of the grapes. Few of today’s wines are made that way and most won’t improve beyond a few years. Late picking fruit gives you obviousness; early picking produces sublime elements.

In my earlier (2009) article, I spoke of trying a 1994 Napa Cabernet that was balanced. I wrote, “It came from a tiny vineyard harvested early in September, the vines gave about 5 tons of fruit per acre, and the alcohol on the label was 12.7%!” And the wine’s color was red, not black.

Most producers now harvest a lot later, get much smaller tonnages per acre (so red wines are more concentrated), and wines have alcohols of 15% or more.

In my 2009 article, I noted that the 1994 Cab “had a leafy, dried-herb savoriness that only Cabernet can give. And it had that patina of maturity that I’ve learned to love from years of seeking those youthful brats that, after patience, finally gain the sort of couth that I adore in red wine.”

A key point I had missed in that essay of 14 years ago was that crucial to the earlier style of Cab was earlier harvesting.

Later harvesting of fruit, combined with smaller tonnages per acre, and other factors usually result in wines constructed without the necessary stuffing to become complex with age. The tartness profile is too low, for instance.

There is a body of thought that says even a tiny trace of anything herbal in a young Cabernet is an automatic thumbs down. Scores for such wines usually are a death knell. Just try selling such a beast these days.

Yet anyone with even the slightest exposure to classic red Bordeaux wines will tell you that the best usually have a distinctive trace of herbal complexity, otherwise called pyrazine. Often after time in the bottle, it will transmogrify into something delightful.

Some wine reviewers find any pyrazine in a young red abominable. But I find it essential for Cabernets if they’re to age for a decade or two. In time, the green elements turn into pipe tobacco, sage, thyme, and other complex savory notes that are mandatory for a Cabernet to display its varietal-ness.

I recall a bottle of 1881 Château Lafite-Rothschild that a friend bought at a wine auction and opened at a dinner party in 1986. The fruit was still currant-y (!) and it had no over-ripe feel to it. Its complexity had tobacco-y herbs.

Similarly, it was like that for the 1971 Grange that Daryl Groom, then winemaker at Geyser Peak, poured for me at a luncheon in the late 1990s, with its plum/moist earth depth and amazing complexity.

The ’94 Cabernet referenced earlier was harvested early. When it was young, it had faint herbal notes that I loved. But after it was released in 1998, it drew only mediocre comments from writers looking for more opulence.

The 1994 wine was from a vintage that produced “big” wines that had lower acids than I prefer. That year there were a lot of “chewy,” very ripe wines. It was then that I began to notice alcohol levels creeping up.

Wines with alcohols above 14% (very high for the time) showed a faint port-y aroma. That element later became revered by some people. But I had been reared with more savory styles of wine that featured a bit of varietal herbality; without it a Cab was too simple for me. With it, the wine would age.

The above 1994 Cab, tasted at age 15, had spices, like thyme, summer savory, and even a trace of rosemary. The second day, the few ounces left was all about complexity. Even though the fruit then was diminished, the wine still delivered a lot of character. And it was crisp enough to pair with food.

(A good friend has often pointed out to me that my columns about aging of red wines are kind of pointless these days since, as he has frequently noted, “no one ages wine anymore.” He may well be correct, especially since few of today’s reds will actually improve. But I know a few people who continue to care about what a properly constructed red wine can do with time in a wine cellar. They say it’s magical. It is.)

Some younger red wine lovers might argue that earlier-harvested Cabernet, especially those with alcohols that are more moderate than today, aren’t interesting when they’re consumed young. And with winemakers releasing wines at 2½ years, not the traditional four years that had been normal when I entered the wine game, today’s Cabernets are like barrel samples.

One interesting point about this is that the wildfires that have plagued California wine country for the last decade has created an unusual situation that may well be helping those of us who appreciate better-balanced Cabernet. It is leading to earlier harvesting of some grape varieties that previously would have stayed on the vine for a week or two longer.

This includes Merlot, which usually is better harvested earlier/cooler rather than later, when it’s potentially hotter and/or overripe.

The 2020 harvest in many areas of Northern California was so ravaged with fires and smoke that many producers either did not pick the fruit at all, for fear of smoke taint in the resulting wines, or ended up picking the fruit in the hope they could avoid smokey, ashy smells.

Alas for many, they realized that the wines had been ruined by the smoke and they had to discard it.

As a result, the industry suffered huge losses in many areas, which later proved to be even more devastating when one of the industry’s most aggressive supporters, Silicon Valley Bank, collapsed.

The following two vintages (2021 and 2022) represented an object lesson in caution (not to mention humility). In both years, grape growers with red wine grapes approaching maturity chose to begin picking at least a week or two earlier than normal, trying to avoid potential fire storms that might affect the harvest.

I spoke with several winemakers about the last two harvests. In every case, they said they made exemplary wines in both years from slightly earlier-harvested fruit. Two of them said they loved the better structures the wines seem to have than in many prior (later-picked) vintages.

A final point about why many of today’s red wines will not age. It’s simply because boosting a wine’s color with a concentrate like Mega Purple probably has detrimental impact on what the wine eventually will be.

Wine of the Week: Nonvintage Roederer Champagne, Collection 243 ($65) – One of the greatest of Champagne houses is this renowned property that focuses on replicating a distinctive house style for all its wines. It features significant percentages of reserve wines from prior vintages, which makes up the majority of the complexity it builds into each bottle.

The Collection series (replacing Brut Premier) began about two years ago to emphasize that house style but with a slight difference: each numbered version would rely on a single vintage, but without mentioning which vintage.

The important thing is that there is a difference between the 242 and the 243, at least in theory, with the house style being replicated in both. It gives the consumer confidence in knowing how long the wine has been in the marketplace.

Collection 243, largely from 2017, carries the distinctive house style that includes traces of brioche, citrus, and excellent structure. It’s essentially dry, but with a slight richness and the finish. For top-rate Champagne, it’s a good value. It’s often found in major U.S. cities at about $55 per bottle.","['Dan Berger', 'Sasha Paulsen', 'Tom Simoneau']",

He was born on March 22, 1928, in Ravenswood, WV, and is the son of the late Arthur and Mary Barber. In addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by his loving wife of nearly 70 years, Helen “Jo” (Shockey) Barber.

He was a beloved husband, father, grandfather, and great grandfather. He loved his life on the farm where he and his wife enjoyed many happy years raising their children and grandchildren. He loved the land and farming was his life. He believed that God gave us the duty of caring for animals and that growing crops represented the rebirth of the land that he was privileged to tend. He loved teaching others the skills of farming that he had learned over the years. He was an encouraging father who wanted all of his children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren to love God and one another. He was a devout Christian and was a member of Parchment Valley Baptist Church.

Survivors include his loving family. His four children: Karen Skidmore of Cottageville, WV; Mike (Karen) Barber of Mineral Wells, WV; Pam Tuell of Mineral Wells, WV; and Kim (Greg) Tieman of South Charleston, WV. His seven grandchildren: Kristine, Kevin, and Karl Skidmore, Jennifer Barber, Tiffany (Matt) Stoneking, Dena Tuell, and Shane (Jill) Tieman. His five great grandchildren: Gavin Hill, Cameron Stoneking, Charlette Satoy, Sean, and Allison Tieman. He is also survived by one sister, June Barber Corbin of Ravenswood, WV, and one brother Arch Barber of Dayton, Ohio.

The celebration of his life will begin on Thursday, April 13, 2023, with a visitation from 5-8 p.m. and one hour prior to the service on Friday, April 14, 2023, at 11 a.m. at the Casto Funeral Home in Ravenswood, WV. The Reverend Herman Robinson will be officiating. He will be laid to eternal rest at the Ravenswood Cemetery.

As Paul Harvey wrote in his speech to the Future Farmers of America Convention, “And on the 8th day, God looked down on his planned paradise and said, “I need a caretaker.” So, God made a farmer.” Bill Barber was the living example of that farmer.

In lieu of flowers donations may be made to Parchment Valley Baptist Church Building Fund in memory of Bill Barber.

""I was able to win a good amount in college, so I can bring some of those characteristics over, but I really think looking at that roster and some of the young talent on it, that's super exciting,"" Berger said. ""You obviously have Aliyah Boston, who we all know is amazing, and then NaLyssa Smith, Queen Egbo, Destanni Henderson — the list goes on and on. To be able to play with that much talent, that much young talent and come in with them and learn from them and grow with them, I think it's something that I'm really excited about.""

Lowest Rated: Not Available

Birthday: Nov 10, 1955

Birthplace: Stuttgart, Germany

Though he was raised on a steady diet of independent-minded German filmmakers like Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Wim Wenders, director Roland Emmerich aspired early in his career to make blockbuster Hollywood movies. After making a name for himself by helming ""The Noah's Ark Principle"" (1981), the most expensive student film ever made in Germany, Emmerich crossed the Atlantic Ocean to make mainstream studio films. His first, ""Universal Soldier"" (1992), was an unexpected hit, which paved the way for him to direct his pet project, ""Stargate"" (1994). Along with writing and producing partner, Dean Devlin, Emmerich established himself as a resourceful sci-fi specialist who earned a reputation for meticulous preparation and remarkable cost-efficiency. Emmerich launched himself to the top of the Hollywood food chain with ""Independence Day"" (1996), a big, loud, sci-fi film that was long on computer-generated special effects but short on narrative and character development. Despite the campy, clichéd storyline and action sequences, the film made a name for the director. He went on to direct several big budget mega-disaster flicks like ""Godzilla"" (1998), ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (2004) and ""10,000 B.C."" (2008), all of which were panned by critics, lambasted by experts for lack of authenticity and gobbled up by audiences clamoring to see the destruction of the world through variously wild scenarios. By the time he directed ""2012"" (2009), Emmerich was by far one of the few directors capable of consistently making critically-derided movies that nonetheless made enormous amounts of money.",[],

But this real-life Indiana Jones kept bucking the odds.

First, he found a pair of hominid teeth in southern Africa, and then after a fossil hunting dry spell, his 9-year-old son Matthew found the jawbone of a completely new hominid species.

A few years later came Lee's most extraordinary discovery yet: a nearly inaccessible cave filled with skeletons of another new hominid species which seemed to be violating all the rules.

The story of what happened in this cave revolutionises what we understand about the origins of our own human species.

New York-based KKR is set to take a major holding in FGS Global as soon as next week, valuing Rudd’s firm at £1.1billion.

KKR is expected to acquire more than 30 per cent from a combination of senior employees at FGS as well as advertising titan WPP, which owns around 58 per cent of the company, according to the Financial Times.

Bosses at FGS will collect a payment of £200million, with Rudd’s stake understood to be valued at tens of millions of pounds.

FGS is made up of a merger of three communications and lobbying companies controlled by WPP, including London-based Finsbury, Frankfurt’s Hering Schuppener and Washington DC-based Glover Park Group.

Some of its biggest clients include EY and SoftBank.

It had been aiming to float on the stock market next year, but news of the KKR investment is likely to push plans back.
