https://www.cbsnews.com/news/patagonia-ceo-conservationist-kris-tompkins-wild-life-documentary-film/,From Patagonia CEO to conservationist: Kris Tompkins' story comes to life in new film,"Conservationist responsible for new parkland now the subject of feature film documentary

When Kris Tompkins gave up her job as CEO of the Patagonia clothing company 30 years ago, she had no idea her life would one day be featured in a documentary film by Oscar-winning filmmakers.

Filmmakers and close friends Jimmy Chin and Chai Vasarhelyi were drawn to Tompkins' remarkable life when they created, ""Wild Life."" The duo previously won an Oscar for their film ""Free Solo"" about famed climber Alex Honnold's ascent of El Capitan in Yosemite.

""I've always wanted to make a film about a strong female protagonist and Kris is that in spades, and I think especially when her third act came you really see a woman find her voice,"" Vasarhelyi said.

The documentary ""Wild Life"" chronicles the life of Kris Tompkins, who began her career in 1973 working with her friend Yvon Chouinard at his climbing equipment company, which later evolved into Patagonia. She served as Patagonia's first CEO for 14 years until she met Doug Tompkins, co-founder of The North Face and Esprit. After leaving the fashion industry in the early 90s, Doug convinced Kris to join him in Chile, where they began devoting their lives and wealth to buying up vast tracts of land in the Patagonia region at the southern end of South America.

""On a Friday I retired and two days later, on Sunday, with two little bags I closed up my beach house and moved to a roadless area on the coast of Chile,"" she said.

""Wild Life"" tells the story of how Doug and Kris Tompkins spent a significant portion of their lives and wealth purchasing vast amounts of land in Patagonia. Their efforts, chronicled in the film, led to the formation of parks in the region.

The couple never intended to keep the land for themselves. Through their organization, Tompkins Conservation, they became some of the largest private land donors in the world, protecting what Kris Tompkins calls the ""crown jewels"" of Patagonia for everyone to enjoy.

Then, in 2015, Doug Tompkins was killed in a kayaking accident, leaving Kris shattered.

""Losing Doug was the worst thing that could happen to me. In the shadow of that, you realize you have no fear and that makes you absolutely free to take on anything,"" Kris Tompkins said.

Her fearlessness has driven her work, as seen in her efforts to secure even more land and reintroduce native species such as pumas and jaguars. Additionally, she handed over land for five more national parks to the president of Chile in 2018, making it one of the biggest private land donations in history.

""It was the purest sense of joy I think I ever have experienced,"" she said.

At the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, in March, Tompkins watched the documentary for the first time, at the age of 72. Despite her age, she feels she still has a lot more work to do.

""My intention is to do this work until I drop dead,"" she said. ""So we're just getting warmed up.""","['Ben Tracy', 'Ben Tracy Is A Cbs News Senior National', 'Environmental Correspondent Based In Washington', 'Analisa Novak']",

“I’m kind of pessimistic about the fate of this planet,” Chouinard said. “We’ve been giving one percent of our sales for a long time. We’ve given away $200 or $300 million over the years, but I’m always thinking, ‘What more can I do?”



Directed by Oscar winners Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, “Wild Life” chronicles the decades-long efforts by conservationist Kris Tompkins and her late husband and the North Face founder, Doug Tompkins, to create national parks throughout Chile and Argentina. The couple helped Chouinard, who appears in the doc, create and run Patagonia.



Chouinard, who joined Vasarhelyi, Chin and Tompkins onstage after the MoMA screening, added that his decision to give the planet $3 billion also had to do with his two children, who have “simple lives” and no desire to inherit Patagonia.



“When we found a way to basically make earth our stockholder, it seemed real logical,” he continued. “It’s a way for Patagonia as a company to give a lot more money. We’ve given away $33 million since November. We’re going to give away another $40 or $50 [million] within the next couple months. It’s a pretty good system. I can tell you this: it’s not a burden. It’s really a lot of fun.”

As with their previous films “Free Solo” and “Meru,” Chin and Vasarhelyi’s “Wild Life” explores the world of elite climbers – in which Chin is a leading figure – mixing adventure footage that was shot in Chile’s Patagonia National Park, a former private reserve that Tompkins Conservation donated in 2018, with interviews and archival footage.



Chin, who climbed with both Doug Tompkins and Chouinard, was keen on making “Wild Life.” Tompkins on the other hand was wary.



“Jimmy just started showing up,” she explained. “I’d say what are you doing? And he would say, ‘I’m just going to film this stuff and we will see if something happens to it.’ Finally, it began to take shape and they asked me if I would be interested in something like this. I was reticent at first but then I thought if there was ever going to be a film about our story it would be with Jimmy and Chai. So I just put my life in their hands.



Vasarhelyi was also initially hesitant about the project, which will have a limited theatrical release beginning April 14 and stream on Disney+ May 25.



“He was like, we really should make a film about my mentors, the icons of the outdoor industry,” she recalled of her husband’s passion for the project. “But I don’t climb. I don’t ski. I don’t really go outside. So I was like, no way. Oh, no,” Vasarhelyi said.



Eventually the filmmaker came around and found herself captivated by Kris Tompkins’ life story and how she handled life after the death of her husband.



“It just became so compelling, this idea of Kris finding (her way),” Vasarhelyi said. “We made this film for our kids. Climate change is the existential question of our children’s generation. And this is a story that says very clearly, put one foot in front of the other and just try because trying matters.”

CEO Ryan Gellert says the change has galvanised his focus on Patagonia making a profit - though not at any cost

Renewed focus on collaboration to overcome significant challenges in supply chain

Worn Wear, Patagonia’s programme to keep its products in circulation, accounts for only $5 million of its $1.5 billion revenue business annually, while 13% of the polyester it uses still comes from virgin petroleum.

Partnership with Samsung latest in effort to reduce microplastic pollution from synthetic fibres















April 11 - Six months ago, the family-owned outdoor clothing brand Patagonia announced it was transferring ownership to a charitable foundation dedicated to saving the planet. But what, if anything, has changed?

Ryan Gellert is unlike almost any other company chief executive, though the reasons for his exceptionalism aren’t strictly personal. Yes, he thrives in the cut and thrust of business, but then so does every CEO. Yes, the Florida native is opinionated (regularly signing political petitions); ambitious (company revenues have hit around $1.5 billion on his watch); and outdoorsy (he climbs, cycles, snowboards); but, again, none of these especially mark him out.

The clue is in the logo on his fleece jacket: an etched mountainscape embedded with the word Patagonia. The name enjoys an almost cult-like status among adherents – a group that started out in 1973 with California’s small climbing community and has slowly expanded over the decades to all manner of outdoor aficionados across the world.

Six months ago, the business world sat up and took notice of the California-based outdoor apparel brand when Yvon Chouinard, the company’s activist-minded founder and sole owner, decided to transfer 98% of the company’s stock in perpetuity to a non-profit trust. The trust’s mission is, on the face of it, straightforward: to use the company’s future revenues for “fighting the environment crisis and defending nature”.

In a single legal stroke, 51-year-old Gellert says he became answerable to Mother Earth as his single shareholder and ultimate boss. Publicly, Gellert, who took on the top job in September 2020 after six years heading up Patagonia’s European operations, is all smiles and high-fives about the new arrangement: “I’m incredibly inspired now to take every dollar in profit that we have in the business and see it drive what’s just a magical format.”

But what, if anything, has really changed inside the clothing brand since the overhaul of its governance structure? And what implications might the move hold for the wider cause of sustainable business?

The answer to the first is, frankly, not a whole lot. If anything, knowing that the company’s profits are now destined directly for environmental causes has, contrary to some assumptions, galvanized Gellert’s focus on business success. At Patagonia, whose down sweater jackets start at $320, “profit” has never been a dirty word. “We’re unapologetically a for-profit business,” Gellert asserts.

Not for-profit at any cost, however. Profits, he argues, are a means to an end, not the end in itself. It’s certainly a compelling idea, but is it realistic? In a world of finite resources, continued fossil-fuel dependency, and non-circular production, it is reasonable to question if an industry such as apparel can ever be truly clean and green.

The dilemma of decoupling economic growth from environmental impact is not one Gellert bats away. “We're still taking more from the planet than it can afford to give. It's still a really big paradox.”

Patagonia’s efforts at resolving this paradox began back in 1996, when the company switched to organic cotton after its in-house research revealed the chemical footprint of conventionally grown cotton.

Likewise, Patagonia was a zero-waste pioneer, committing in 2005 to recover and reuse the polyester in its clothing. In 2011 the company famously took out a full-page advert in the New York Times with a picture of one of its fleeces and the tagline “Don’t buy this jacket” – an attempt to highlight the folly of “buying and selling more and more things people don’t need”, the company said.

However, Worn Wear, Patagonia’s programme to keep its products in circulation, still only accounts for a sliver ($5 million) of its business annually, while 15% of the polyester Patagonia uses still comes from virgin petroleum.

Then there is microplastic pollution, a problem linked to many synthetic fabrics (including nylon, polyester, rayon, acrylic and spandex) used in its products. The company has invested $180,000 over the last five years to help campaign groups bring awareness to the issue, but Gellert accepts that Patagonia has to do more to get its own house in order.

“The shedding of microfibres from our apparel is a real issue for us. So, we've joined industry working groups, we funded independent research, and we’ve brought to market some initial, early-stage solutions,” he says, pointing in particular to a washing machine filter system recently developed in conjunction with Samsung.

To date, Patagonia’s customers have appeared to buy into the brand’s “we’re trying, but this is difficult” line. How much longer that patience will last is up for debate. In the United States, the knives of the Republican party are already out for so-called “woke capitalism”. As one of the movement’s most visible poster children, Patagonia can expect any divergence between practice and rhetoric to be jumped on quickly.

No sooner had the company’s announced its much-trumpeted transfer, than media speculation began brewing of an elaborate tax dodge. (Had Chouinard chosen to sell rather than gift Patagonia, his capital gains bill would have amounted to an estimated $700 million; as it was, he paid closer to $17.5 million).

Gellert refutes this, insisting that the company’s new structure is a logical continuation of its long-standing mission. He cites Patagonia’s move in 2017 to donate to environment charities the $10 million that it saved after President Donald Trump cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.

At the same time, he accepts that Patagonia's environmental footprint will come under ever greater scrutiny. “There are challenges in our supply chain that we have that we want to solve. That's been that way throughout our history. And as we solve some, we figure out there are others. It's just a never-ending process,” he states.

The Samsung partnership is one of many the company is forging as part of a new emphasis on collaboration. Whether its advancing the cause of bio-based polyester, pushing for an end to per- or polyfluorinated chemicals (often called “forever chemicals”), or developing denim technologies with low water requirements, Gellert says many of the solutions lie outside his company. The logical solution is to work with others.

Not that collaboration is easy, especially in a cut-throat and competitive industry like fashion and apparel. Take organic cotton. While awareness of the issue has increased “quite a bit”, chemical-free cotton still only makes up less than 1% of global production, says Gellert. “We’ve just not been successful in scaling that as a percentage of the total across industries”.

His expectations for regenerative agriculture – another key focal area for the brand – are more optimistic. Bolstering these hopes is the growing cross-industry support for the Regenerative Organic Alliance, a certification that Patagonia helped found in 2017, primarily for clothing firms but which now counts numerous backers in the food sector and other agriculture-based industries.

However, Worn Wear, Patagonia’s programme to keep its products in circulation, still only accounts for a sliver ($5 million) of its business annually, while 13% of the polyester Patagonia uses still comes from virgin petroleum.ts 1% for the Planet fund (based on a donation of 1% of sales revenues). Since 1985, the initiative has generated a total of around $1503 million in grants. Under the new arrangement, the company expects to donate about $100 million a year.

Typical of the beneficiaries are the environmental campaigners behind the creation of Europe’s first “wild river” national park. The initiative, which covers a 118-mile stretch of the Vjosa River in Albania and was signed into law by the country’s national government in mid-March, is the result of a 10-year grassroots campaign.

Patagonia leant its weight to the cause back in 2017, with a mix of in-time support and “fairly small grants” (around $800,000 in total). In its new-found guise as a planet-owned business, it plans to up its contribution to more than $4.6 million over the next three years to help campaigners make good their vision for the park as a centre for conservation and eco-tourism.

But for Gellert signing cheques will always come second to pushing for a less destructive, more regenerative approach to capitalism. “The biggest impact we’ve had is just modelling a different form of business,” he says. “That’s the big idea: everything else is in service to that.”

If that’s the case, the obvious follow-up question is who’s following Patagonia’s lead? In the narrow sense of private business owners handing over their assets to the planet, then the answer is “not many”.

Gellert does not seem dismayed by this apparent failure. “Are we having conversations where others are saying, ‘We want to do exactly what you did?’ No, but that wasn't the goal. It’s not realistic and it's not going to happen. (But) I think it misses the point."" He says the move has given the brand the opportunity to ""expand the conversation"". ""If the guardrails on how you could engage used to be a metre wide, I think now they're kind of two metres wide,” Gellert reasons.

The timing for such conversations is germane. The stir caused by Patagonia’s announcement last year is, in truth, just one small ripple in a far greater tide of change. Faced with a pincer movement from consumers, regulators, investors and even their own employees, businesses are “increasingly coming to the importance of leaning into solving some of the biggest problems we face”, says Gellert.

In the United States, the $369 billion in stimulus for green investments through the new Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides a further prompt. The IRA might fall short of the previously proposed Green New Deal, but, in Gellert’s view, it still represents the “most transformational, impactful piece of climate friendly legislation anywhere in the world”.

But the man with Earth to answer to is not naïve. The route towards the kind of cleaner, greener, fairer business models to which Patagonia aspires is laden with hurdles. If these are to be surmounted, business must become “more honest with themselves and their stakeholders”, he says. In his sights are members of the Business Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who he says engage in “contradictory behaviours and messages”.

And while Patagonia has been a vocal supporter of the B Corp movement, a global network of companies geared towards making business a force for good, he is concerned that the movement’s rapid growth in recent years might be diluting the original purpose. “Candidly, I've been listening to those conversations as part of the B Corp community for a number of years … so we'll continue to keep eyes on that and also maintain a dialogue with the leadership.”

But Gellert’s main focus is on making Patagonia as planet-friendly as it can be. As he discovers the truth in the maxim that the reward for solving one problem is often a list of even greater problems, he may be guided by Patagonia’s founder, who wrote in his 2005 book, Let My People Go Surfing, that dogged determination to overcome challenges will pay off. “If you focus on the process of climbing, you’ll end up on the summit.”

He spent two years poring over archival records about the lives of 145 castaways from an 18th century British warship called The Wager but that wasn't enough for him, he told 60 Minutes correspondent Jon Wertheim. So Grann flew to Chile, chartered a 52-foot vessel, and ventured to what is now known as Wager Island himself. Grann and his crew endured the moody waters over a ten-day journey. He hunkered down on the ship's floor and popped some Dramamine on the way to the island.

""I would never have endured anything that these people endured, but my own quests do sometimes get me in places and to do things I otherwise would never do in my ordinary life,"" Grann said. ""You would never catch me going to Wager Island in a little boat.""

David Grann working on research 60 Minutes

With British and Spanish empires at war, the doomed warship set sail as part of a squadron, rounding Cape Horn in search of a Spanish galleon filled with treasure off the coast of the Philippines. That meant negotiating some of the world's most treacherous waters and winds. The Wager lost its way just off the coast of Patagonia, getting into trouble in the Golfo de Penas, or Gulf of Pain. It careened into rocks and was torn to pieces. The castaways swam to the nearest island and spent months living on the inhospitable spit of land.

""I am not an explorer. … When I look at these people, I mean, I woulda been the first to die on the island,"" Grann said. ""Let's be perfectly honest.""

Starving and sick with scurvy, the castaways dealt with unrelenting cold and whipping winds. The only edible thing that grows on the island: celery, tough it did cure their scurvy.

""There were no animals. I kept thinking, 'Oh, there's gotta be something. Like, something. There's gotta be a rat,'"" Grann said about his visit to Wager Island. "" But we couldn't find anything.""

Though the 56-year-old author admits he prefers the indoors and hates camping, he says he began to feel a trip to the island was necessary while researching ""The Wager,"" out April 18.

""There came a point where I began to fear that I could never fully understand what these 150 or so men had gone through on that island unless I went,"" Grann said. ""There's always a moment where something gnaws at you, something unknown. And so it was then that I decided to try to make this trip.""

Marooned on Wager Island, the castaways split into factions, including a group intent on overthrowing their captain: an act punishable by death. It was a classic mutiny.

""On this island you see everything playing out. You see questions of leadership playing out. You see questions of loyalty playing out, questions of duty playing out,"" Grann said. ""You see human nature being peeled back. All that is taking place in this little tempest.""

Jon Wertheim and David Grann 60 Minutes

For his first book in 2009, ""The Lost City of Z,"" a No. 1 bestseller turned into a feature film, Grann trekked through the Amazon to a place known as the Green Hell, following the trail of a British explorer, Percy Fawcett. Grann's swashbuckling takes on an added degree of difficulty on account of a degenerative eye condition he's had since his 20s.

""It's terrible when you're on an expedition. Like, you're, like, can't see at night, and you're stumbling, getting lost, or you're falling, or you're on a boat, or something like that,"" he said. ""But because I know I have this weakness, I'm very acutely observing as much as I can. And in some ways, maybe paying more observation than if I could just take it in so easily.""

Grann first put those powers of observation to work as a reporter on Capitol Hill. But, tired of Washington spin, he wanted to write real stories. In 2003, he joined the New Yorker magazine. In one issue, he might write about an eccentric giant squid hunter in New Zealand; in another, a botched death penalty conviction in Texas. All of it was predicated on exhaustive research.

""The truth is that I don't think you can really be a writer and a researcher and an investigator unless you are at some level obsessed,"" he said.

Reconstructing stories from history, blow by blow, is classic Grann. He's created his own subgenre of narrative nonfiction: a page-turning mix of history, journalism and true crime.

""The Lost City of Z"" was Grann's first work to be adapted into a film. His 2017 book, ""Killers of the Flower Moon, ignited a Hollywood auction, with a winning bid of $5 million. The film—directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio—premieres at Cannes next month.

The movie will clock in at nearly four hours, Variety reported. It will break records to become Scorsese's and DiCaprio's longest film.

""The Wager"" has also been optioned for film; it would be Grann's sixth story to hit the big screen.",[],2023-04-16 00:00:00
https://news.yahoo.com/former-patagonia-ceo-rose-marcario-032200180.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,"Former Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario delivers CWA keynote on leadership, ethics","Apr. 13—Former Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario delivered her CWA keynote address at CU Boulder on Thursday in an informal Q&A session, touching on topics such as ethics, leadership and activism.

During her 12 years at Patagonia, Marcario deepened the company's commitment to advocacy, environmental activism and responsible business. She left Patagonia in June 2020 and is now a founding partner with ReGen Ventures, a board member and adviser to environmental impact companies and chair of Rivian's Forever Foundation for nature.

Marcario discussed how many corporations do not operate with sustainability in mind. She said many are operating as ""unregulated monopolies"" in an ""inequitable society"" with a few billionaires controlling massive amounts of assets.

""If we stopped right now all innovation, we already have all the tools and all of the technology to curb the climate crisis,"" Marcario said. ""What we don't have is investment.""

Despite this, Marcario said she believes we can create a ""livable future."" She called on the audience to look at their sphere of influence — whether that's school, family, friends, work — and ask how they can make a change. She said to vote, be an advocate and understand the issues in your neighborhood.

Aside from the topic of businesses, Marcario answered many questions about her leadership skills and personal experiences, specifically as a woman and member of the LGBTQ community.

""I define leadership as love. Love that creates outcomes of purpose,"" Marcario said. ""When I say love, I mean you can't get incredible results without creating this feeling of love and excitement for an aspirational vision of our future.""

Longmont resident Roz Bliss said she knew a bit about Patagonia before attending Marcario's keynote. She said she thinks it's an interesting company and she wanted to hear about how Marcario led it.

Story continues

Gunbarrel resident Pat Fay attended Marcario's keynote and said he appreciated the vision Marcario had for Patagonia and her leadership.

""It's being uncompromising in that vision and being able to communicate and share that vision so that other people jump on board,"" Fay said.

Marcario said the good news is she's seeing more founders and company CEOs realize the urgency of the climate crisis. She said she's seeing more money being put into foundations to help such causes and said company advocacy is important.

""Advocacy is just saying, this is what I believe. This is what the company believes in. And I don't think there's anything wrong with doing that. But what's wrong, and what most companies hide behind, is what they believe is not so good,"" Marcario said. ""They might believe in your destruction, they might believe in your food supply being destroyed by pesticides. So, I think advocacy is going to become the new norm.""

In the early 1990s, Kristine McDivitt, then the CEO of Patagonia, was at a cafe in El Calafate, Argentina, when a man named Doug Tompkins sat down next to her. ""Hey, kid, how ya doing?"" he asked. Doug was the best friend and climbing buddy of her boss, Yvon Chouinard, and he was known as a brilliant, arrogant bon vivant. In 1964, Doug had cofounded the North Face with his first wife, Susie Tompkins Buell. Seven years later, the two started another clothing company, Esprit. After cashing out, he moved to Chile to live alone in a small cabin.

Kristine, a free-spirited California girl who had worked her way up the ladder at Patagonia after an entry-level, two-dollar-an-hour ""assistant packing"" job in her teens, knew Doug's reputation. So when he tried to convince her to stay in South America with him, she demurred. (She also happened to be engaged to another man at the time.) But he was persistent. Months later, a five-day visit to Chile to see the farm Doug had purchased at the edge of a fjord turned into five weeks. Finally, Kristine returned to the States, ""blew up her personal life,"" and never looked back--by 1993 she had quit her job, married Doug, and moved into his cabin.

For the next two decades, the pair lived between remote homes in Chile and Argentina, only occasionally returning to California. They had a grand plan: buy and protect as much land threatened by logging and overgrazing as possible. Eventually, through a series of nonprofits run by the Tompkinses, the couple purchased hundreds of thousands of acres from ranchers and absentee landowners. Their fairy-tale life ended in tragedy in 2015, when Doug died in a kayaking accident in Chile at 72. Wracked with grief, Kristine was left alone at the helm of Tompkins Conservation, which was on the cusp of making the largest private land donation in history, to take the form of numerous national parks granted to the governments of Chile and Argentina.

Who better to capture this epic saga of love and loss on film than the Oscar-winning couple of Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin? Their new documentary, Wild Life, follows Kristine Tompkins's trajectory from barefoot Southern California girl to CEO of one of the most influential outdoor brands in the country to champion of conservation. The film will debut in select theaters starting April 14 and will be available to stream on May 26 on Disney+.

Chin met the Tompkinses through Chouinard and Rick Ridgeway, a climber and former Patagonia vice president. ""Doug, Yvon, and Rick have all been heroes to me since I started out as a young dirtbag climber and photographer living in Yosemite,"" Chin said in an email. And after spending time with Kristine, he ""quickly learned that she is a force of nature, an incredible human being. So of course, taking on this film was something deeply personal to me.""

Before Doug died, Chin had visited the couple in South America and shot footage of them, noodling on the notion of making a film. After the kayaking accident, he and Vasarhelyi approached Kristine about putting together a movie of her life. ""It took me a while to think that a film like this should be made,"" said Kristine, adding that she only gave her approval because she thought it would be good for encouraging conservation efforts. ""I decided if I was going to do it, I would do it only with Jimmy and Chai. They are extraordinary filmmakers and trusted friends.""

Wild Life delves into the Tompkinses' years of joy and struggle and the aftermath of the tragedy, as told through intimate interviews with Kristine and a close circle of lifelong companions. Chin's signature stunning photography of Chile and Argentina is intercut with 1960s footage of America's original climbing, skiing, and surfing dirtbag royalty: Kristine singing the Beach Boys' ""California Girls""; the Grateful Dead playing at the opening of the first North Face store; Chouinard, Doug, and their funhog crew unfurling a flag after their historic ascent of Fitz Roy. The clips add levity and also bring into focus that, even before they were a couple, the Tompkinses were fundamental players in the creation myth of modern American outdoor culture.

It's clear that Doug and Kristine were soulmates. Yet they were also intense overachievers committed to conservation work in countries that were often suspicious of and hostile toward their efforts--some Chileans, for example, thought that the couple's real aim was to populate their land with American bison. The pair rarely had time to explore together. In the film, Kristine sets out to climb a 7,500-foot peak in Patagonia's Chacabuco Valley that her husband and Chouinard first summited in 2009. Doug dubbed the peak Cerro Kristine. Chouinard and Ridgeway--both were on the kayaking expedition that killed Doug--accompany Kristine on her journey to reach the summit, along with Chin and professional rock climber Timmy O'Neill. ""Why did we never climb our mountain together?"" Kristine asks the clouds as she stands alone, looking out over Patagonia National Park.

The documentary is a testament to fierce love and how its power can serve a greater purpose. ""There was a deep, deep union and devotion to each other, and they came together with a common vision,"" says friend and filmmaker Edgar Boyle in Wild Life. But the grief that resulted when that union was severed by tragedy is difficult to watch. At one point, Kristine recounts, while flying with Doug's remains to his final resting place near their home in the Chacabuco Valley, she carved their names in the coffin with a small knife. ""Doug's death was an amputation,"" Kristine told me. ""I took some long walks by myself and was never sure I'd turn around and walk back.""

The only way forward was to dive even further into her conservation work. With the help of a roughly 300-person staff at Tompkins Conservation, she exceeded her late husband's dream of creating 12 national parks. The current count: 15, along with two marine parks and a total of 14.8 million protected acres in Chile and Argentina--an area roughly the size of West Virginia. Those numbers keep expanding, along with Kristine's seemingly endless supply of energy to continue the work she started with her husband. ""I carry Doug around in my pocket. If I get really stuck on something, I simply ask: 'What would you do?' I am just grateful that we have this marriage,"" she said, still speaking of their union in the present tense. ""It's given me unbelievable strength.""

Kristine is still the president of Tompkins Conservation, but she has relinquished day-to-day operations to focus primarily on strategy. In late February, she met with Chilean president Gabriel Boric to move forward with a proposed donation of 230,000 acres on behalf of Tompkins Conservation, with a view toward creating national park number 16 at Cape Froward, on the Brunswick Peninsula, the southernmost point of the continent. The rugged, largely unexplored region is a refuge for endangered species like the huemul deer. The proposal reclassifies state land that, if included, would make the area bigger than Grand Teton National Park. In recent years, two independent local organizations have spun off from Tompkins Conservation. Rewilding Chile and Rewilding Argentina each work in their respective countries to bring back endangered species--from the Andean condor in Patagonia National Park to the jaguar in Argentina's Ibera National Park.

""I want people to realize that this film is not about Doug and Kristine,"" she told me. ""It's the representation of hundreds of Chileans' and Argentines' work. Mother Nature is not winning this game. We are all on the losing team, and everybody needs to join the fight.""

https://www.abcactionnews.com/these-companies-give-a-discount-when-you-recycle-old-clothes,These companies give a discount when you recycle old clothes,"Sometimes our closets and dressers seem like they’re brimming with clothing. Despite this, we might find ourselves feeling like we have nothing to wear. Both situations signal it might be time for a closet cleanup.

The funny part about trimming your wardrobe is that it makes you feel like you have more clothes — mainly because you’re not spending unnecessary energy trying to sift through a mound of shirts you don’t like. Our style changes, and so do our bodies.

Clearing out your closet as part of an annual or bi-annual routine is a great way to keep getting dressed the simple task it was meant to be, rather than a pull-your-hair-out experience!

Adobe

Ditch the guilt of holding onto something that you know you’re never going to wear because you’re either sick of it, it doesn’t fit right, or even worse — it was a gift. Keeping something in your closet after it’s no longer useful to you doesn’t earn you any gold stars. It’s better to pass items along to places that can either recycle them properly or put them in the hands of people who can actually use them.

What’s even better than being a good steward of the planet this Earth Day? Earning extra savings for your good deed. Did you know that several big retailers allow you to donate your old clothing directly to them and will dish out a discount toward future items? Here are seven stores that let you bring in the old and head out with the new — without paying full price!

The North Face

If you have apparel from The North Face, chances are it’s been put to some good use outdoors. When you find it’s time to pass on a clothing item or footwear, bring it to The North Face retail or outlet stores to earn $10 toward your next purchase of $100 or more through its Clothes the Loop initiative. Your items can be from any brand in any condition.

The items are then sent to nonprofit Soles4Souls, which repurposes them for micro-enterprise programs providing small businesses with new opportunities.

H&M

Launched globally in 2013, H&M’s Garment Collecting program aims to help reduce textile waste. Bring in any unwanted clothing or textiles and give them to someone behind the register. They don’t have to be from H&M and can be in any condition. You’ll be handed a thank-you coupon in return that can be used toward a future purchase — or that same day if you like.

Once you’ve handed over a bag of clothing, they’re given to a partner and marked for rewearing, reusing as other products, or recycling of textile fibers to make insulation.

Madewell

If you have a pile of old denim jeans on hand, head over to Madewell stat! They’ve partnered with Cotton’s Blue Jeans Go Green program to recycle denim. Madewell will give you a $20 coupon to be used on any new full-priced pair of their jeans.

Your denim will go into housing insulation for underprivileged neighborhoods, so you can feel good about recycling them. Madewell says that it has recycled more than 1 million pairs of jeans, which can hopefully be used to provide insulation for almost 1,500 houses.

American Eagle

Like Madewell, American Eagle has partnered with Cotton’s Blue Jeans Go Green to help you get $10 off toward a pair of new jeans through its Real Rewards program. The catch: The jeans must be made of at least 90% cotton. Each pair earns you $10 off plus you earn 2x points; Real Rewards credit card holders have the option to earn 4x points.

Old jeans get converted into other useful products, such as insulation, pet bed inserts or sustainable food and pharmaceutical packaging.

Gap

If you’re planning a big cleanup soon, send your old items to thredUP, which has partnered with Gap to make recycling apparel easier. Gap even gives you a 15% payout bonus for going through them.

To participate, create a free account and print a shipping label. Pack a box with anything you no longer want that’s still in good condition, like clothing, purses, shoes and accessories. Send it through the U.S. Postal Service or FedEx and you can earn shopping credit for pieces deemed eligible: they show no signs of wear, damage or alteration.

Earn 4%-56% of the estimated resale value for Gap items, along with other eligible pieces from Levi’s, Asos, Nike and Zara. Items that don’t meet thredUP’s quality standards are offered through their heavily-discounted mystery Rescue Boxes or are responsibly recycled.

Adobe

Patagonia

This is a brand that’s known for its environmental activism. Take advantage of Patagonia’s buy-back program, where you can receive up to 50% of the item’s resale price on gear that’s still wearable and in good condition. The “thank you” credit can be used in-store, on Patagonia’s website or at Worn Wear, which passes on used items to others who can use them.

Carter’s

Parents like to say that kids grow up in the blink of an eye — because it’s true! Thankfully, Carter’s, makers of baby and kid clothing, doesn’t leave you high and dry when your little ones get bigger. The company teamed up with TerraCycle to make recycling used children’s clothing pretty easy.

Sign up for a TerraCycle account and print a downloadable prepaid shipping label. Fill your box with non-donatable clothing for kids and babies. Then pop it in the mail and send it through UPS. Receive 25 reward points per shipment of 15 pounds or more, which can be used to discount purchases from Carter’s.

TerraCycle separates the clothing by type, then shreds and recycles it into raw materials or aggregates and processes it.

Adobe

Most clothing items can be donated or recycled. For the planet’s sake, don’t throw it out until you’ve exhausted other possibilities.

If you’re not looking to do more shopping anytime soon, you can always donate items to a local thrift store like Goodwill or Salvation Army. While you might not earn a discount on a new purchase, you can ask for a receipt to lighten your tax load and that’s also a good thing!

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/david-grann-author-wager-60-minutes-transcript-2023-04-16/,"Author David Grann tumbles back in time to tell true story of shipwreck and mutiny for ""The Wager""","Some authors are perfect matches for their subject matter: John Grisham was once a trial lawyer. John le Carré was once a spy by another name. Then, there's David Grann, who has emerged as one the world's top-selling writers—and darling of Hollywood developers—by venturing into unknown worlds, abandoning his comfort zone. The unlikely adventures of David Grann. His latest book ""The Wager,"" tells of British castaways from the 1740s….it's an open-water quest that becomes a saga of shipwreck, anarchy, betrayal, and murder - imagine ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" meets ""Lord of the Flies""—except every word of it really happened…. Grann's success comes from, yes, meticulous reporting and vivid writing… but also from how he puts the pieces together.

Jon Wertheim: You talk about structuring these stories as a puzzle.

David Grann: Yes.

Jon Wertheim: Is there only one way to solve this puzzle?

David Grann: Well, I-- I'm very weird about this. I-- I do always think there is some kind of idyllic form of a story, like, some, like, perfect, pristine, lost city that you're trying to find and get to.

Jon Wertheim: If you were gonna structure the David Grann story, what would you suggest--

David Grann: Oh God.

Jon Wertheim: Where would we start?

David Grann: Oh gosh, in some archive. Looking semi-blind at some document. That's where it always begins.

Jon Wertheim and David Grann at The National Archives in London 60 Minutes

We can work with that…We find our subject inside The National Archives in the suburbs of London…unboxing dusty files, consulting documents so frail, they require a pillow for support. Grann spent two years playing detective, gathering facts, source material for his latest book.

David Grann: We're going to have to touch this really carefully.

He took us tumbling back in time to the 18th century.…

David Grann: You see that?

Communing with logbooks, muster books, and diaries from the expedition of the HMS Wager…the warship featured in his book.

David Grann: And here you see the little initials next to their names here. You'll see lieutenant. You'll see AB means able seaman.

Jon Wertheim: How are you deciphering this?

David Grann: When I first looked at a lot of these books, it was like reading gibberish. I was like, 'What-- I don't -- what is this telling me?' And so I would have to look at it again, look at it again, start to figure out the codes, the language they used. But once you do, these documents speak volumes.

All these names and symbols told a larger story. With their Empires at war, a British squadron of roughly 2,000 men set out to capture a Spanish galleon filled with treasure off the Philippines. That meant rounding Cape Horn, negotiating some of the world's most treacherous waters and winds. But, one of the ships in the squadron lost its way just off the coast of Patagonia. Grann showed us on his own map where the Wager got into trouble, a place aptly named.

Jon Wertheim: The Gulf of Pain.

David Grann: They're barreling into the Gulf of Pain. As they're coming around, they're desperately, frantically trying to avoid this land.

Jon Wertheim and David Grann 60 Minutes

The Wager careened into rocks, ripping apart. One hundred forty five castaways, many sick from scurvy, swam to the nearest island….you'd think the name alone—the Gulf of Pain—would discourage visitors, especially one bespectacled 56-year-old man who admits he hates camping.

David Grann: I spent the first two years doing research, in a way very suited to my physical attributes-- which is in archives.

Jon Wertheim: You're indoors.

David Grann: Yes, indoors. But there came a point where I began to fear that I could never fully understand what these 150 or so men had gone through on that island unless I went. There's always a moment where something gnaws at you, something unknown. And so it was then that I decided to try to make this trip.

So in 2019, Grann flew to Chile and chartered a 52-foot vessel…

David Grann: The boat looked-- you know, it looked pretty big. I thought, this is good. This is gonna be-- it's gonna be, like, a Jacques Cousteau expedition. We're gonna be fine. We kind of stay originally through these channels that are sheltered in Patagonia. I think-- it's perfect, it's beautiful. It's a little cold. It's winter. But it's-- it's beautiful. And then there's sort of point where the captain says to me 'All right now-- now we gotta go out into the open sea if we're gonna get to Wager Island.' And that was my first glimpse of these terrifying seas.

Jon Wertheim: Rough seas.

David Grann: It was truly terrifying-- or at least for me. Let me say, my captain seemed cool.

Grann and his crew endured the moody waters over a 10-day journey.

David Grann: I had to sit on the floor hunkered down. The Dramamine was pumping in me…

This is Wager Island, named for the ship that washed up 300 years ago. A spit of inhospitable land, hugging the Pacific coast. Scenic from a distance but you wouldn't want to spend the night. The castaways did months in unrelenting cold and whipping winds. You know it's bad when celery is the big selling point, the only edible thing that grows on the island. Though it does cure scurvy.

David Grann: There were no animals. I kept thinking, 'Oh, there's gotta be something. Like, something. There's gotta be a rat.' But we couldn't find anything.

This depth of detail, it's Grann's earmark. He's created his own subgenre of narrative non-fiction - keeping readers hanging with a page-turning mix of history, journalism and true crime. But it's also literary pointillism. You step back and glimpse a larger tableau—one with broader themes.

Jon Wertheim: This fascinates you?

David Grann: Oh yeah, yeah. Well, you see, I mean, on this island you see everything playing out. You see questions of leadership playing out. You see questions of loyalty playing out, questions of duty playing out. You see human nature being peeled back. All that is taking place in this little tempest.

And this was no one-off. For his first book, 2009's ""The Lost City of Z,"" a number-one bestseller turned into a feature film…

Grann trekked through the Amazon—to a place known as the Green Hell— following the trail of a British explorer, Percy Fawcett.

Jon Wertheim: Did I hear right, you took out supplemental life insurance--

David Grann: Yes, I did. I made sure I got extra travel insurance. I had a little child at the time. There is something-- and I think this is important. And it's not something I really like to talk about, but there is something selfish about these journeys and even something about the people I write about because many of them die on these expeditions.

Grann's swashbuckling takes on an added degree of difficulty on account of a degenerative eye condition he's had since his 20s.

Jon Wertheim: What's the impact of that on your work?

David Grann: I mean, it's terrible when you're on an expedition. Like, you're, like, can't see at night, and you're stumbling, getting lost, or you're falling, or you're on a boat, or something like that but because I know I have this weakness, I'm very acutely observing as much as I can. And in some ways, maybe paying more observation than if I could just take it in so easily.

Grann first put those powers of observation to work as a reporter on Capitol Hill. But, tired of Washington spin, he wanted to write real stories. In 2003, he joined the New Yorker magazine. In one issue, he might write about an eccentric giant squid hunter in New Zealand; in another, a botched death penalty conviction in Texas. All of it predicated on exhaustive research….

David Grann: Please don't judge me.

From his office—itself an inhospitable island of sorts—

Jon Wertheim: Wow…

David Grann working on research 60 Minutes

At his home in a suburb of New York, Grann showed us a pile of research from his 2017 book ""Killers of the Flower Moon."" The book centered on the mysterious deaths among members of the oil-rich Osage Nation in 1920s Oklahoma. And—boxed up in an archive; where else?— Grann found a smoking gun, evidence of a systemic murder campaign by outsiders.

David Grann: This was secret grand jury testimony. And--and it was unmarked. I mean it was a public record, but I was like, 'Is this supposed to be-- am I allowed to look at this?'

The book has sold nearly 2 million copies…and it ignited a Hollywood auction. The winning bid: $5 million. The film—directed by Martin Scorsese, starring Leonardo DiCaprio—premieres at Cannes next month. (Paramount, parent company of CBS, is a distributor.) It's not lost on Grann that stories birthed in decidedly unglamorous archives, end up on red carpets in the French Riviera. ""The Wager,"" out this week, has also been optioned for film—it would be Grann's sixth story to hit the big screen.

Jon Wertheim: Do you worry what Hollywood's gonna do to your work?

David Grann: Yes. Yeah, you always worry. The truth is you don't have that much control when-- when Hollywood develops your work.

Jon Wertheim: What is your role once one of your books gets put into development?

David Grann: Maybe a certain actor will wanna know about the person they're playing.

Jon Wertheim: One of the stars will call you and say, 'Tell me more'?

David Grann: Yeah

Jon Wertheim: What's an example?

David Grann: Oh, I'll-- I'll respect privacy, but the-- but, you know, occasionally, some people will--will reach out to you but

Jon Wertheim: You do not seem particularly comfortable talking about--

Jon Wertheim: --the Hollywood angle to this.

Jon Wertheim: --your posture has changed, you're--

David Grann: No…No….Yeah, I don't like it. I don't like it. I d-- because-- you know, it's just a different world, you know. It's just a different world.

David Grann: This is Portsmouth.

Grann feels much more comfortable transporting himself three centuries back to this world.….The Wager set sail here in the British harbor town of Portsmouth. The entire expedition may have faded from memory. But Grann being Grann, he saw references everywhere.

David Grann: Anson's name is still remembered and on this pub…

We visited The Ship Anson, a pub named for the squadron's leader, George Anson. Here, men were rounded up by the British Navy and pressed into service on the Wager's doomed mission.

Jon Wertheim: You could be drinking-- you know, have-- having a beer enjoying yourself.

David Grann: the next minute you know--

Jon Wertheim: --throw you on a ship–

David Grann: --you're being put on-- a little boat that was like a floating jail. They would take you out to the ship. And it's what made creating unity and cohesion on the-- on this expedition particularly challenging.

A few hundred yards from the pub, we boarded the HMS Victory, an 18th century warship preserved in the harbor, virtually the same model of ship as the Wager - a thousand tons of oak and rope, where the crew ate and slept next to cannons.

David Grann: And after it was fired. You'd have this huge force flying back. And you better get out of the way.

Having immersed himself in what he calls the wooden world, Grann got to the point he could render a description like this…

David Grann: At one point it was so windy and the gusts were so strong they couldn't fly their sails. So the captain orders the men to climb the mast and to use their bodies as threadbare sails. So they are on top of the mast, some of 'em 100 feet in the air, in a typhoon. You have to understand that the masts are going like this. They're almost touching the water. And these men are clinging like spiders.

Jon Wertheim: Wow…

As Grann breathes fresh life into events from hundreds of years ago, you almost wonder if he had climbed the mast himself. He's the first to admit, yeah, that wouldn't be the case…

David Grann 60 Minutes

David Grann: I am not an explorer. Like, if you compare, I mean, when I look at these people, I mean, I woulda been the first to die on the island. Let's be perfectly honest

Jon Wertheim: if we're gonna play this out. What's the-- what's the cause of death?

David Grann: Oh, my cause of death, terror. I woulda taken one look at those seas and be, like, 'I'm outta here. This is nuts.' So-- you know, I-- I would never have endured anything that these people endured. But my own quests do sometimes get me in places and to do things I otherwise would never do in my ordinary life. You would never catch me going to Wager Island in a little boat.

About Wager Island… marooned and starving, the castaways split into factions, including a group intent on overthrowing the captain. An act of mutiny; punishable by death….When two groups of castaways made it home—we won't spoil how—they had conflicting accounts of what had happened.

David Grann: You know, imagine this: they get back to England. They have survived scurvy, multiple typhoons, starvation, shipwreck. And now after all that, they're summoned to face a court martial, and they could be hanged. I mean, it's just kind of unbelievable.

Unbelievable. And complicated. Grann solved the puzzle of structuring ""The Wager"" by telling this tale on the high seas from three different perspectives, allowing readers to decide for themselves where the truth resides. And if he fixated on the perfect way to let the book unfold—devoted to his own quest as his characters are to theirs—that's what makes it classic Grann.

Jon Wertheim: What is your obsession with obsession?

David Grann: You know, I always thought for a long time that my fascination with obsessed people was because they made the best stories, right? I mean, the Ahabs of the world, there's a reason why we tell Ahab stories, right? Over time, you know, I've begun to realize that I might have a little bit more in common with some of these obsessives than I care to admit.

Jon Wertheim: You call it your fascination with obsession so, they're obsessed. You're merely fascinated.

David Grann: That's what I like to think, yes. I'm just merely I am completely dispassionate. But you know the truth is that I don't think you can really be a writer and a researcher and an investigator unless you are at some level obsessed.

From their Oscar-winning “Free Solo” about Alex Honnold’s risky climb to their 2021 venture “The Rescue” about the cave divers who helped save a stranded Thai boys soccer team, the couple’s brand implies both gorgeous vistas and cinematic thrills.

Their latest, “Wild Life,” trades in many of the same themes, and yet carries little of that tension. This time around,

More from IndieWire

“Wild Life” tells the story of Douglas and Kristine Tompkins, a billionaire couple who bought up millions of acres of land in Chile and Argentina to turn into national parks. The film, which uses Kris as its primary source, is a paean to their good deeds and a memorial to Doug, who died in a kayaking accident, dramatized on screen with animation.

Chin and Vasarhelyi capture Kris’ overwhelming love for Doug and her palpable grief, but they also aim to convince the film’s audience of the importance of their work, not only preserving these landscapes but also rewilding them, bringing native animals back to their rightful habitats. But, watching the film, there’s a gnawing feeling you aren’t getting the full picture, mainly because the directors fail to dig into the inherent links between capitalism and conservatism in the Tompkins’ work.

These rich people are the good guys, we are told, and it is mostly left at that.

And they are very, very rich. Doug made his money founding The North Face and Esprit, alongside his first wife Susie. Kris, meanwhile, was the CEO of the brand Patagonia. An adventurer first and foremost, Doug gave up his business life in the late 1980s and moved to Chile. He pursued Kris in what she describes as a whirlwind romance that ended with her leaving both her job and another fiancé and joining him in South America, where they delved into their conservation work.

“Wild Life” frames this tale around footage of Kris on a climb in memory of Doug where she is joined by their friends and Chin himself, who was invited on the trip. This imagery of stunning snowy mountaintops is what audiences have doubtless have come to expect from these filmmakers, however, the movie is also reliant on interviews and archival footage as it gives an overview of both of their careers before their marriage and their ambitious park plan. Though this material takes up a good chunk — maybe too much — of the doc, it also feels surface-level, like the Cliffs Notes version of their lives, where everything is twinkly-eyed and anything too complicated is brushed over or unacknowledged.

The same is true as the film moves into the section about their work in Chile and Argentina. Chin and Vasarhelyi certainly acknowledge the controversy surrounding the Tompkins’ projects, as well as the resistance from local residents, but it doesn’t interrogate the idea of these Americans coming in and buying up land with a strict notion of what was the “correct” way to preserve it. In a review of a Tompkins’ biography by Jonathan Franklin in a 2021 issue of The Atlantic, Michael O’Donnell wrote that a “harsh paternalism informed his dealings with the people of Patagonia: I’m going to take this land of yours and show you how it ought to be used.”

In the documentary, Tompkins Conservation Attorney Pedro Pablo Gutiérrez tells the camera: “We behaved, Chileans, very badly.” It’s an easy hand wave of an explanation for an entire country’s complicated emotions. Kris, at one point, describes Doug’s “dogged, relentless pursuit of beauty,” and the land certainly is beautiful, but the value of the aesthetic over the human feels telling.

The entire running time of the movie could have easily been devoted to the Tompkins’ struggles to open their parks, which Kris ended up accomplishing after Doug’s death. The directors, however, are also intent on framing this as their love story and, indeed, Kris’ unimaginable sadness in wake of Doug’s death is upsetting to watch and deeply moving.

At the same time, “Wild Life” is incomplete even as a portrait of that sorrow, because it spreads itself too thin trying to tackle such a wide swath of time. Doug, not there to speak for himself, looms over everything and yet still comes off as mysterious, this ruthless businessman who was also ruthless in his conservation.

What results is a documentary that comes off mostly as a PR stunt. Where “Wild Life” could have been a nuanced look into how wealth and ecology collide, instead it’s merely just a celebration of these rich people doing the “right thing” with their money. But who really pays?

Grade: C

A Nat Geo release, “Wild Life” will hit select theaters today, with a broadcast debut on the National Geographic Channel on Thursday, May 25 and a streaming release on Disney+ on Friday, May 26.

It also has a reputation for being the best ""just-in-case"" bag for travelers, so I put it to the test.

A good tote bag is worth its weight in gold — especially one that works no matter where you are going or what you are doing. Recently, I took the Patagonia Ultralight Black Hole Tote Pack on a trip to Mexico City because I wanted something other than my purse to use while out and about exploring the town. Much to my surprise, I'd enlisted the help of one of the most versatile travel bags I've ever encountered — it is three bags in one, after all.

This tote was convenient to pack because it folds down to the size of a paperback book and I could add it to my laptop case when not in use. But, if you were to carry it on the plane, it fits under an airplane seat without being too bulky. It is the perfect cross between a duffle bag, a backpack, and a purse. From running errands around town, hiking, shopping, sightseeing, or even going on an adventure, it carries your essentials effortlessly.

As previously mentioned, the Patagonia Ultralight Black Hole Tote Pack boasts impressive versatility, and users can easily customize its multitasking design with its three different carrying options — by hand, over your shoulder, or even on your back like a traditional backpack. I was carrying it on my shoulder as I was shopping around the streets of Mexico City’s La Condesa neighborhood to keep my wallet handy while shopping, but seamlessly turned it into a backpack as soon as we walked into the National Museum of Anthropology because I wanted to be hands-free and careful around all the beautiful artifacts.

I also found the pack to be quite strong and durable. Like many of Patagonia’s products, this one is made of 100 percent recycled nylon and is weather resistant with its durable and waterproof silicone and polyurethane coatings, which is good news if your trip forecast will be plagued with inclement weather.

Beyond its multipurpose exterior, the Black Hole Tote Pack is also stocked with thoughtful features to delight any traveler. The internal compression straps and the bungee cord are game changers because you can really stuff the convertible backpack to the brim, and still have room to close it with the large zipper at the top.

There's also an internal zippered pocket, which acts as prime storage to keep essentials like your wallet, keys, and smartphone secure, whereas the external zippered pocket will prove to be more useful to stow away less valuable (but still highly precious) travel items like sunglasses, lip balm, or sunscreen — a.k.a. things that you might need in a pinch and don't want to dig through inside your bag for. I also appreciated the two stretch-mesh water-bottle pockets on the outside; I could store away both my reusable bottles as I walked around the city and did not worry about running out of water.

Pockets aside, one thing that really surprised me was how comfortable the bag was to carry. I am always cautious of how traditional backpack harnesses will fit my somewhat shorter frame. But, the ones on the Patagonia Ultralight Black Hole Tote Pack are adjustable and made from highly breathable mesh, so not only does it fit like a glove, but it also doesn’t get too sweaty or uncomfortable with extended use. They also neatly tuck away when using the pack over your shoulder or holding it in your hand — another unexpectedly thoughtful design feature.

With a 27-liter capacity and a 15.5-inch by 10.3-inch by 8-inch frame, this pack can fit a lot of stuff, and I found it so helpful that I got rid of my hefty travel purse and put everything I needed in this bag for most of my trip. When not in use, it weighs 13 ounces and can be stuffed into its pocket for easy packing, which is why it's been dubbed as the best “just-in-case” bag by REI shoppers. One reviewer wrote, “I purchased this packable tote bag just in case my daypack was too small for the conference I was going to. This bag was a lifesaver and went above and beyond for an entire week.""

Travel + Leisure / Emily Belfiore

Another customer called it a “perfect travel bag” because of its versatility, which is what I appreciated as well during my travels: “I love the bag because of how functional it is. The top straps are long enough to carry it under your arm (a common problem with these bags). It's perfect for conferences, groceries, walking around town, bike commutes, and trips to the dog park.""

I hate to admit it, but I got the Patagonia Ultralight Black Hole Tote Pack with the intent of shoving it in my suitcase and using it only if needed while traveling. But after it proved to be so useful in Mexico City, I find myself reaching for it regularly. Outside of traveling, it is the perfect size to carry groceries, my gym gear, or anything I need for a day out and about. So, if you are looking for a great multi-purposeful bag (and a backup for extra storage when you're traveling), this is the one for you.

I know I will be bringing the Patagonia Ultralight Black Hole Tote Pack along for all my travels this year and beyond. So, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and get one for yourself at REI.

https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/david-grann-next-big-adventure-120000800.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,This Is David Grann’s Next Big Adventure Story,"The writer David Grann had been reading about Wager Island for years when he finally decided to see it for himself. A boggy speck that abruptly rises out of the Pacific Ocean on the Chilean coast of Patagonia, it’s named for the British Royal Navy vessel that wrecked just offshore in 1741. One hundred forty-five men were stranded on the island, where strict military order rapidly gave way to mutiny, cannibalism, and murder. Grann had spent countless hours poring over the contradictory, self-serving accounts of the sailors, combing through archives in England and squinting at 18th-century handwriting, but he still felt like there would be something missing from his understanding until he went there. The remote island is just as desolate as it was nearly 300 years ago, but he found a Chilean captain willing to undertake the multi-day voyage in a simple boat heated by a wood stove. “It was not,” he told me, “one of the smarter things I’ve ever done.”

And he’s a smart guy, a longtime staff writer for the New Yorker (which, like GQ, is owned by Condé Nast) and a best-selling author. He specializes in gripping historical chronicles and crime stories, filled with fearless explorers and ruthless killers, with twists and double-crosses so rich in intrigue that they would strain credulity in fiction. But Grann’s stories are all true, and because they actually happened, because every detail is invariably backed up by some unearthed court testimony or a dusty file plucked from a long-neglected archive, he’s become one of our culture’s leading sources of holy shit page-turners.

His latest book,The Wager, which comes out this week, spins out the story of the shipwreck and mutiny by weaving together the rival accounts of the ship’s gentleman captain, a lower-class gunner, and a 16-year-old midshipman. The doomed ship left England as part of a squadron on a secret mission to intercept a Spanish treasure galleon loaded with silver, which meant weathering the dangerous storms below Cape Horn, at the southern tip of South America. It’s an adventure, guaranteed to please fans of the seafaring novels of Patrick O’Brian and the movie they inspired, Master and Commander—and, by extension, history-loving dads everywhere.

Story continues

But where O’Brian’s books look back at the Age of Sail through an idealized haze, there’s not much to romanticize in The Wager: The expedition is crewed by old men and invalids, the boat disintegrates in the gales of the Southern Ocean, and the bodies of the scurvy-ridden sailors melt off of their bones. The expedition is revealed to be a boondoggle at best, and probably something far more sinister. Grann has managed to push the conventions of true crime and pop history into something more meaningful: The Wager is a story about a shipwreck, but it’s also about how the men who somehow made it off the island told their competing accounts, which became the sensational true-crime of their day, and watching Grann make sense of the tangle raises fascinating questions about how stories take on a life of their own.

The film rights to The Wager were sold to two of the biggest names in Hollywood long before the book was even printed—the plan is for it to be turned into a movie directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio. The pair have already adapted Grann’s previous book, Killers of the Flower Moon, which recounts a murderous conspiracy in 1920s Oklahoma targeting wealthy but vulnerable Osage Indians and the oil on their land. That movie, which stars Robert De Niro, Brendan Fraser, and Lily Gladstone alongside DiCaprio, will premiere at Cannes next month, before a wide release this fall. It isn’t the first story of Grann’s to be adapted. Most notably, 2006’s The Lost City of Z became a 2016 movie of the same name, and the Old Man and the Gun, Robert Redford’s final film role, was a modest hit. But none have yet been produced on close to this scale: Killers of the Flower Moon is already perhaps the most-anticipated film of the year, with awards-season buzz before anyone has even seen it. It’s the biggest kind of (non-comic book) movie that Hollywood still makes, and Grann is in some way on the precipice of becoming the culture’s foremost (non-comic book) storyteller.

But Grann is focused on his books, and on the release of The Wager. He has said in the past that when he’s deep in the grips of obsession with a story he can forget to shave or change his clothes. But when we meet up on a pier in lower Manhattan’s South Street Seaport, a touristy maritime historic district, he's wearing a neat slate-gray chore coat and round tortoiseshell glasses, and gives off the owlish, excitable air of an unusually talkative librarian.

The oldest ship on display at the pier was built more than 100 years after the events of the book, but is, like the Wager, a three-masted sailing vessel built to run cargo between India and the U.K., and they share some common points. A ladder running up each mast passes through a wide platform—the “lubber’s hole,” so named because sailors disdained anyone who would climb through it. For the sailors of the era, Grann explains as he gazes up, the only dignified way to ascend the mast was to swing, monkey-like, around the side of the platform, high enough that a fall would mean drowning, or at least serious injury. The men “had these secret self-images that they had to live up to,” he says. “The biggest insult was to be a landlubber—just a pathetic, pitiful creature.”

The other people on the pier, schoolkids and European tourists, might see rigging and masts, but Grann looks up there and he sees something more human and alive: he sees insecurity and anxiety and the status consciousness of the long-gone men, the struggle for honor and money that drove these people to do the things they did. Grann is clearly drawn to extreme situations where men—and his stories are overwhelmingly about men—see virtues like determination and courage curdle into obsession and violence. But to hear him tell it, he’s more of a landlubber himself.

When he met his Chilean captain, Grann's first thought was that the boat had looked bigger the in the pictures. For three stormy nights, the vessel was trapped in port—and Grann was stuck onboard in his tiny berth. When, after days underway, the boat crossed into the open ocean, Grann got a taste of the conditions that swamped the Wager. “It was like being a ping pong ball, just being tossed about,” he said. It was too rough to eat or even stand up, so he sat on the floor, holding on tight, with his only solace a stupefying dose of anti-nausea drugs and an audiobook of Moby-Dick.

When he finally made it to Wager Island, he found the wild celery and seaweed that the sailors lived on (and that, incidentally, cured their scurvy). He confirmed that the wet ground and dense vegetation made overland travel almost impossible. He found pieces of wood that an earlier expedition had deduced came from an 18th-century sailing ship—and what other ship could they be from? But the main discovery was how miserable the island was. “It gave me some sense of how they were suffering from hypothermia,” he said, “and so worried about freezing to death.”

The story of Grann's own Patagonia expedition comes up only glancingly in the book itself. He’s not inclined toward self-mythology, and he isn’t leaning into the glamor of Hollywood, either. He’s not sure he’s going to mess with Cannes. He says one of the best parts about working with movie stars is that his kids think he’s a little bit cooler. But he’s grateful to have the best in the business, “people who actually know what they're doing,” making these movies. When I ask what he means by that, I expect to hear about Scorcese’s mastery of cinematic mood, maybe, or the crazed charisma DiCaprio brought to his role. Instead, I hear about research.

While the Killers of the Flower Moon movie was filming, Grann was on call to answer questions, and “One time they called me and they wanted to know about the lighting in a house. ‘Was it electric? How is it powered?’ And I said, ‘You know, that was a question I did not have to know for the book,’” he tells me. “But then they went out and they found lamps from the 1920s!” He was particularly impressed with how the production engaged with the Osage community and made efforts to accurately use their language onscreen. Predictably enough, the way to impress Grann is not by being one of the world’s most famous movie stars, but by rolling up your sleeves and getting into the archives.

Grann’s mother was a big-shot editor and publishing executive who worked with bankable authors like Tom Clancy, but she warned her son against becoming a writer himself. He did it anyway, teaching middle school after college to support himself while trying to break into writing during the summer. He wasn’t particularly interested in politics, but he took a job as a copy editor at the nuts-and-bolts Washington chronicle The Hill, where he hunted for typos in other people’s stories. “It was kind of funny, because I have an eye disorder—I'm semi-blind,” he said. “But you take what you can get.” He quickly rose through the ranks at the newspaper, then began to branch out, but it was still difficult to branch out from Washington stories: “People pigeonholed me: David Grann covers Congress.”

His breakthrough—the first story he wrote that is recognizable as a David Grann Story as we know it now—came when crime and conspiracy happened to intersect with congressional politics. The botched assassination of an aggressive local prosecutor brought Grann to Youngstown, Ohio, then the center of what he called “one of the last truly mob-rub counties in the country,” which was represented in Congress by James Traficant. Years before Traficant arrived in Washington, the congressman had been taped negotiating with mob associates who had supported his election as sheriff. When Grann read a transcript in which the future congressman promised that any disloyal deputies would “fuckin’ come up swimming in [the] Mahoning River,” Grann told me he thought, “OK, yeah: This is the kind of journalism I want to do.”

Before much longer he was hired at the New Yorker, where he has been a staff writer since 2003 and has had a remarkable run of stories. The world’s leading Sherlock Holmes enthusiast was found dead in a situation with eerie parallels to the stories he loved. A charming septuagenarian stick-up man couldn’t stop robbing banks. A French serial imposter claimed to be a missing 13-year-old Texas boy—and was taken in by the boy’s family for sinister reasons of their own.

If you ask Grann how to put together a juicy story like one of these, the result feels a bit like hearing from Tiger Woods about how to hit a nine-iron: Grann will happily try to answer, and it will all feel like intuitive good advice, but you don’t exactly come away with the sense that you’re going to get the same results.

But it does perhaps get at why his stories resonate like they do. It starts, Grann says, with finding the right story: not just the most sensational story, though that is important, but one with the personalities and archival material that allow it to be told as a narrative. Once you have that, he told me, you have to find the right structure to tell the story in a way that builds suspense without being manipulative. (If you’ve ever struggled through a podcast that selectively doles out information or forces you into the bumbling host’s investigative point of view, you know what he’s talking about.) Grann is committed to getting as close as possible to the individuals involved, with a precise sense of their knowledge and motivation. This brings you closer to the characters, and it also makes you acutely aware of their blind spots.

It’s in the negative space of the historical record where the real revelations of Grann’s stories tend to hide. In Killers of the Flower Moon, reading between the lines of the dry FBI records is what brings the full horror of the Osage reign of terror into focus, implicating the wider community, not just the convicted killers. A similar revelation comes late in The Wager: After escaping the island and then being marooned again by the mutineers he escaped with, a free Black seaman named John Duck reaches civilization—only to be sold into slavery and disappear from all later accounts. Because Grann gives you enough context to see from several perspectives, you’re made to wonder about what happens to the people who the archival record neglects.

But untangling these perspectives is also a big part of what makes these stories so fun to read. Reconciling the sailor’s accounts, “One person may say, ‘I proceeded to extremity on the island,’ Grann laughs, “then you cut away to the next person, who says, ‘Yeah, that guy shot the man right in the head.’”

The founder and former owner of Patagonia, Yvon Chouinard has been named this year’s Cannes LionHeart award winner.

The award is given to a person who has made a significant and positive difference in the world. Chouinard is being recognized for his lifelong commitment to environmentalism and philanthropic contributions.

Last year the Chouinard family transferred ownership of the 50-year-old Patagonia to a trust and a nonprofit organization that ensure that all of the company’s future profits—estimated at about $100 million annually—will be used to fight climate change and protect undeveloped land around the world.

Chouinard stated: “Receiving the recognition of the LionHeart award sends the message that creativity can be a powerful force in the work to save our home planet. The creative industry is uniquely placed to lead the way in ambitious business practices and to inspire people everywhere to act now.”

As a company, he added, “we give away 1% of sales each year and are a certified B Corporation. But none of this is enough. That’s why we decided it’s time for a new experiment, with the announcement that earth is now our only shareholder.”

https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/shipwreck-mutiny-murder-david-grann-book-interview-1234713488/,Why a Harrowing 18th-Century Shipwreck Is a Parable for Our Times,"Writer David Grann is one of the premier nonfiction storytellers of our time. His bestseller The Lost City of Z transported readers into the Amazon on a quest for a mythical civilization (and became a 2016 movie starring Charlie Hunnam). He followed up in 2017 with The Killers of the Flower Moon, a blistering investigation into a series of unsolved murders of members of the Osage tribe in Oklahoma during the early 1900s (the film adaptation, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, premieres at Cannes this month). Grann’s masterful new book The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder is at once an adventure on the high seas, a horror story, and a courtroom drama — a little bit Rashomon meets Lord of the Flies. It’s the story of a doomed British naval vessel that sets out in 1740 to wage war against the Spanish and ends up wrecked on an island off the shores of Patagonia. The men are quickly divided. There’s mayhem, treachery, and death, imperialism and class struggle, lots of scurvy, and enough harrowing scenes to haunt any reader. When some of the survivors return to England years later with wildly different accounts of what happened, things get even weirder. There are competing accusations and narratives of mutiny and murder that lead to a court martial, where losing means death. Grann says the tragedy of the Wager is a “parable for our turbulent times. Just like in America today there was a battle over history and who gets to tell it and efforts by those in power to erase a sinful past.”

How did you find this story?

When I was looking for my next book, I was looking for something contemporaneous. The last place I expected to end up was in the 18th century. But I came across an old journal written by John Byron, who had been the 16-year-old midshipman on his majesty’s ship the Wager, when it set off on this doomed expedition. It was a very old book written in archaic, convoluted, faded English, but I kept pausing over these arresting descriptions about typhoons, scurvy, and then a shipwreck on an island that becomes a kind of Lord of the Flies, with warring factions, and there’s murder and even cannibalism. I realized that this document holds some clue to one of the more extraordinary sagas of survival and adventure I’d ever come across. Editor’s picks

It’s incredible that anyone survived given the calamities and deprivations the crew faced.

Yeah, but I was looking for a deeper resonance. Why resuscitate and revive and spend years excavating something from the 18th century? But as I started to dive into archives and pull journals, I realized that as interesting as what had happened on the island was, what happened after several of the survivors made it back to England was even more incredible. They’d waged this war against every element and now, suddenly, they are summoned to face a court martial. And if they don’t tell a convincing tale, they could be hanged. And so, in hoping to save their lives, they release these various accounts trying to depict themselves as the heroes of the story. They all begin to wage a war on the truth.

Which feels very relevant now….

Right. I would come home and I’d flip on cable news or read the newspaper and there would be all these discussions about wars over the truth and disinformation and misinformation. Discussions of so-called alternative facts and fake news. And then I would go back to reading about the Wager. I’d be reading these documents about all these people shaping and manipulating their narratives. Then I discovered that there were even fake journals! And there was like an 18th-century version of allegations of so-called fake news.

That’s all too close to home.

Yes, because there’s a war over history right now. Like, what history books can we teach? There was a teacher who was afraid to teach Killers of the Flower Moon in her school in Oklahoma, and the books were just piling up.

That’s crazy.

Absolutely crazy. There were these wars of what books can be taught and what history could be reckoned with. And then I would go back to this story, and they’d be holding this war over history. There was a debate over who will get to tell the official history. And then of course, there were these efforts by those in power to cover up the past to essentially erase certain parts of it. And I thought, my God, this 18th-century story is like this weird parable of our own turbulent times. And that was why I decided to spend five years working on it. Related

It’s really a Rashomon-like story. When you’re dealing with competing narratives, as a journalist and a historian, how do you weigh the differing accounts?

At some level you can never completely resolve it. Joan Didion famously said, “We all tell ourselves stories in order to live.” Yet, in this case of the men of the Wager, they quite literally have to tell their stories in order to live. And if they don’t tell a good one, they’re going to get hanged. I had never seen such a case where you can see each individual shaping their story and burnishing certain facts and leaving out other facts. And so, I decided rather than try to be some omniscient being, the best way to handle it was just simply to show it.

There are still multiple conflicting accounts of the events.

I chose to tell the story from the perspective of three of the men, all of whom served on the Wager: Captain David Cheap; John Bulkeley, the gunner; and then John Byron, the midshipman. And thereby show how each one is shaping the facts. I leave it up to the reader to judge as best as they can. My feeling was that by doing that, you gain insight into how we all shape our stories, and how we all hope to emerge as the heroes of them — in order to live with what we’ve done or haven’t done.

The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder Courtesy of Penguin Random House

The accounts vary widely in some places.

I’ll just give the most vivid example in the competing accounts: You have one senior officer say, “I was forced to proceed to extremities on the island.” And that’s all he says. There’s never been a greater bureaucratic phrase. And then you pick up John Byron’s version and he says, “The captain shot a guy in the head, and I had to cradle my friend bleeding out in front of me.” Right there you learn about each person, from what they leave out and what they choose to emphasize. But reading all of them together, I think it gets you pretty close to the truth.

What’s left out of history is in many ways some of the most tragic parts of the book.

Absolutely. One of the Wager’s castaways was named John Duck, who was a free black sailor at the time. And he is somebody who survives going around Cape Horn in a violent typhoon, he survives one of the worst scurvy outbreaks ever recorded. He survives the shipwreck and then survives one of the longest castaway voyages. And yet, unlike so many others, he cannot tell his story. He is kidnapped and sold into slavery. I could find no record of what had happened to him. The absence of John Duck’s story underscores how many chapters of history can never be told. I was as haunted in many ways by the gaps in the story — by the John Ducks. What his story drove home to me was that the most sinister crimes and worse racial injustices have been largely excised from the American consciousness.

The Wager is clearly about the cost of empire and yet most of these people on the ship are just trying to stay alive or make some money, and remain seemingly unaware that they are in the service of an imperialist nation.

They are completely unconscious. When you read their narratives in the journals, these people are either dreaming about heroism or rising in the ranks of the military, or coming back with riches or simply trying simply to survive to get back to their families. And many of them are victims of this system.

Some are just folks off the street who get kidnapped or press-ganged into service in the navy.

Many of these people didn’t even want to go on the damn voyage. They’re forced onto the ship. And I do think the narrative reveals how empires survive by having so many citizens, consciously or not, who are complicit. So many of these people are complicit in a system that is also victimizing them.

I kept thinking about the Iraq war and America’s own imperial ambitions and folly.

I thought of Vietnam and the Gulf of Tonkin. The roots of the war are absurd. It’s called the War of Jenkins’ Ear, after Spanish forces allegedly cut off this British sailor’s ear. This story is kind of touted by imperialists as a pretext war. They were really just looking to expand the British empire. You realize how much history informs the present. We’re standing on history; it’s always there. In many ways this story is an illustration about how empires preserve power, not only by the stories they tell, but also the stories they leave out.

You’ve written about explorers who get lost in the Amazon and someone trying to cross-country ski across Antarctica. Why are you drawn to extreme stories?

Those circumstances are like these little laboratories that test the human condition. They end up revealing something, the kind of secret nature, the hidden nature of us, the good and the bad. And you can really see it play out. So I think they’re revelatory sorts of tales. Like in the Wager, you see these selfless acts, and then the same person, moments later, will commit a shocking act of brutality.

It all goes south very fast for the men of the Wager.

They descend into a Hobbesian state of nature. They start off with the imperial notion that Western civilization is somehow superior, yet they descend into warring factions and there are mutinies and murders, and a few even succumb to cannibalism. Which is probably why the British Empire wants the story to go away. They don’t want to admit that British officers didn’t behave like gentlemen, they behave like brutes.

Shifting gears, the Killers of the Flower Moon movie is set to premiere soon. What can you tell us about that?

It’s premiering at Cannes and out in the United States in October. I’m not a movie person, I’m a nerdy writer. But I feel very fortunate and blessed working with Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio and that whole production team has been pretty remarkable. You hope with these projects that you’re going to find people who have the same fierce commitment to the story as you do, which isn’t always easy. This is an important story to get right, because in the case of Killers of the Flower Moon, this is about an outrageous racial injustice that had been papered over in much of our collective consciousness.

Did the filmmakers work closely with the Osage nation?

That is the most important question to me. When people say, “What has the experience been like?” — like, I wrote a book, I did my best with that. And so, for me, the most important thing is that the people in the film work closely with the Osage nation. And, and to the best of my knowledge, the Osage were deeply involved in the production and the shaping of the story at every level. And the good news is after the experience of filming Killers of the Flower Moon, Scorsese and DiCaprio asked if we can team up again for a film about the Wager. I was like, “Oh, yeah, that sounds good to me!” [Ed. note: DiCaprio’s rep would not confirm if this was in the works.]

OK, so, you’ve written about the Amazon, the shipwreck of the Wager, and a deadly trek across Antarctica on skis. How would David Grann do in any of these experiences?

I’m like a little nerdy guy. I’m basically half-blind, bald, out of shape — at this point, sadly, an older gentleman. The idea for me to go exploring is the most preposterous thing in the world.",['Sean Woods'],2023-04-16 15:00:00+00:00

Standard activities, like seeing a movie, going out for dinner, or visiting the nearest theme park, can definitely be fun.

But what are you missing out on by overlooking the dozens of other activities you can do for free in your hometown?

Google a list of the best free events and activities in your area. You’ll likely turn up some hidden gems that will enrich your life without detracting from your bank account.

2. Reduce and rearrange

Tired of your current living space? A little decluttering can go a long way toward freshening up the area.

List your extra stuff on Facebook Marketplace, and you’ll have a little more cash, plus a little more space to revamp your home’s aesthetic.

Switch out which items you have on shelves, move pictures across the room, and move the couch to give your room more feng shui.

3. Travel off the beaten path

Popular destinations are popular for a reason, but they are often the most expensive.

If your biggest plans revolve around visiting the world’s most commonly seen sites — from the Taj Mahal to pristine Caribbean beaches — you might see your savings dwindle fast.

Consider finding some cheaper, off-the-beaten-path vacation spots where you can choose your own unexpected adventure.

4. Don’t follow the crowd

FOMO is real. It’s also really expensive. A Credit Karma study from 2019 found that almost 50% of all millennials spend beyond their means to keep up with their friends.

Instead of spending with the crowd, blaze a new activity trail by proposing alternative opportunities for your friend group — or work on saying no to activities you can’t afford.

5. Grow your own salad bowl

In the market for a new hobby to spice up your day-to-day life? Gardening gets you outside and gives you the chance to watch something grow from the ground up.

It can also expand your palate by introducing you to foods you haven’t tried before. Easter egg radishes and organic arugula are much more expensive in stores than they are to grow yourself.

Unless you have a sprawling country farm, you probably won’t grow enough to replace everything on your typical shopping list. But you can certainly grow enough to serve yourself several salads throughout the spring and summer.

Also, you might be able to make extra money selling produce at your local farmer’s market.

6. Open an online shop

Maybe gardening isn’t the hobby for you — but crocheting, making collages out of sea glass, or gluing button eyes on rocks to make a little rock family could be.

Whatever you do in your spare time, odds are good that someone on the internet will find it interesting (button-eyed rocks included, surprisingly).

Selling online is a solid way to make sure you’re making time for your hobbies while earning a little extra cash on the side too.

7. Switch to vintage

Before you make another brand-new purchase, see if you can find a similar item with a lot more pizzazz (and for a lot less money) at a vintage store instead.

New clothes and furniture might have their place, but a beige sofa from this season’s Costco collection can’t compare to the personality of the lime green ’70s chaise longue you got for $5 at the thrift shop down the street.

8. Get free stuff through Bing

All jokes about Bing’s AI chatbot melting down aside, using Bing as your primary search engine is a great way to earn free stuff.

After you sign up for a free Microsoft Rewards account, you earn points for every Bing search. Those points can be redeemed for everything from Xbox games to Target gift cards.

9. Reward yourself for meeting goals

The fear of negative financial consequences is enough to get some people to budget, but budgeting based on fear isn’t exactly fun for anyone.

Instead, try planning mini-celebrations or rewarding yourself every time you meet a financial goal. Obviously, you don’t want your reward to kick off a crisis in your finances, so try to focus on experiences over objects.

Throw yourself a party, take a day off and go hiking, or drive out of the city and see the stars. Then set another goal with another built-in reward and start again.

10. Try a new recipe instead of a new restaurant

It’s tempting to hit up the newest brunch place or swing by a fast food chain for lunch, but eating at home is almost always cheaper than eating out.

Luckily, at-home dining doesn’t have to be boring and bland. Sites like Budget Bytes list hundreds of affordable but adventurous meals for aspiring chefs on a budget.

11. Schedule automatic savings

Most banks let you determine a pre-set amount to move to savings as soon as money arrives in your checking account.

You don’t have to move much — after all, having $5 in savings is objectively better than having $0 in savings.

And since the money moves before you even see it, you likely won’t feel like you’re being deprived of anything.

12. Budget for your biggest activities

When you know in advance how much your next adventure will cost down to the last penny, you can spend accordingly.

You won’t have to take on debt (especially pesky high-interest credit card debt, which can hound you for a lifetime) to pursue your dreams. And the less debt you have, the freer you are to plan more, and even bigger, adventures.

If taking time out of your busy life to sit down and budget sounds boring, that’s because it probably will be. But the planning will pay off big time.

And you can keep budgeting interesting by thoroughly researching every aspect of your upcoming activity. You might find a cheaper but more exciting opportunity you wouldn’t have encountered otherwise.

13. Enjoy your next staycation

You don’t have to leave home to enjoy life. Instead of immediately spending your tax return on your next adventure to a far-off destination, pocket the cash and switch things up by vacationing at home.

Set up a tent in the living room and roast marshmallows over your stove, or build a blanket fort strung with fairy lights to make a cozy reading den.

Believe it or not, you really can have just as much fun at home as you would elsewhere — and you’ll save a good chunk of cash as well.

Bottom line

You’d be forgiven for thinking living on a budget means sacrificing all the things that bring you joy in life.

But now you’ve read our list, which means you’re ready to start living your dream life and get ahead financially.

These tips will hopefully add fun to your life, not take it away — in no small part because saving money sets you up for a lifetime of adventure that will last long after retirement.

Writer David Grann is one of the premier nonfiction storytellers of our time. His bestseller The Lost City of Z transported readers into the Amazon on a quest for a mythical civilization (and became a 2016 movie starring Charlie Hunnam). He followed up in 2017 with The Killers of the Flower Moon, a blistering investigation into a series of unsolved murders of members of the Osage tribe in Oklahoma during the early 1900s (the film adaptation, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, premieres at Cannes this month). Grann’s masterful new book The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder is at once an adventure on the high seas, a horror story, and a courtroom drama — a little bit Rashomon meets Lord of the Flies. It’s the story of a doomed British naval vessel that sets out in 1740 to wage war against the Spanish and ends up wrecked on an island off the shores of Patagonia. The men are quickly divided. There’s mayhem, treachery, and death, imperialism and class struggle, lots of scurvy, and enough harrowing scenes to haunt any reader. When some of the survivors return to England years later with wildly different accounts of what happened, things get even weirder. There are competing accusations and narratives of mutiny and murder that lead to a court martial, where losing means death. Grann says the tragedy of the Wager is a “parable for our turbulent times. Just like in America today there was a battle over history and who gets to tell it and efforts by those in power to erase a sinful past.”

How did you find this story?

When I was looking for my next book, I was looking for something contemporaneous. The last place I expected to end up was in the 18th century. But I came across an old journal written by John Byron, who had been the 16-year-old midshipman on his majesty’s ship the Wager, when it set off on this doomed expedition. It was a very old book written in archaic, convoluted, faded English, but I kept pausing over these arresting descriptions about typhoons, scurvy, and then a shipwreck on an island that becomes a kind of Lord of the Flies, with warring factions, and there’s murder and even cannibalism. I realized that this document holds some clue to one of the more extraordinary sagas of survival and adventure I’d ever come across.

More from Rolling Stone

It’s incredible that anyone survived given the calamities and deprivations the crew faced.

Yeah, but I was looking for a deeper resonance. Why resuscitate and revive and spend years excavating something from the 18th century? But as I started to dive into archives and pull journals, I realized that as interesting as what had happened on the island was, what happened after several of the survivors made it back to England was even more incredible. They’d waged this war against every element and now, suddenly, they are summoned to face a court martial. And if they don’t tell a convincing tale, they could be hanged. And so, in hoping to save their lives, they release these various accounts trying to depict themselves as the heroes of the story. They all begin to wage a war on the truth.

Which feels very relevant now….

Right. I would come home and I’d flip on cable news or read the newspaper and there would be all these discussions about wars over the truth and disinformation and misinformation. Discussions of so-called alternative facts and fake news. And then I would go back to reading about the Wager. I’d be reading these documents about all these people shaping and manipulating their narratives. Then I discovered that there were even fake journals! And there was like an 18th-century version of allegations of so-called fake news.

That’s all too close to home.

Yes, because there’s a war over history right now. Like, what history books can we teach? There was a teacher who was afraid to teach Killers of the Flower Moon in her school in Oklahoma, and the books were just piling up.

That’s crazy.

Absolutely crazy. There were these wars of what books can be taught and what history could be reckoned with. And then I would go back to this story, and they’d be holding this war over history. There was a debate over who will get to tell the official history. And then of course, there were these efforts by those in power to cover up the past to essentially erase certain parts of it. And I thought, my God, this 18th-century story is like this weird parable of our own turbulent times. And that was why I decided to spend five years working on it.

It’s really a Rashomon-like story. When you’re dealing with competing narratives, as a journalist and a historian, how do you weigh the differing accounts?

At some level you can never completely resolve it. Joan Didion famously said, “We all tell ourselves stories in order to live.” Yet, in this case of the men of the Wager, they quite literally have to tell their stories in order to live. And if they don’t tell a good one, they’re going to get hanged. I had never seen such a case where you can see each individual shaping their story and burnishing certain facts and leaving out other facts. And so, I decided rather than try to be some omniscient being, the best way to handle it was just simply to show it.

There are still multiple conflicting accounts of the events.

I chose to tell the story from the perspective of three of the men, all of whom served on the Wager: Captain David Cheap; John Bulkeley, the gunner; and then John Byron, the midshipman. And thereby show how each one is shaping the facts. I leave it up to the reader to judge as best as they can. My feeling was that by doing that, you gain insight into how we all shape our stories, and how we all hope to emerge as the heroes of them — in order to live with what we’ve done or haven’t done.

The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder

The accounts vary widely in some places.

I’ll just give the most vivid example in the competing accounts: You have one senior officer say, “I was forced to proceed to extremities on the island.” And that’s all he says. There’s never been a greater bureaucratic phrase. And then you pick up John Byron’s version and he says, “The captain shot a guy in the head, and I had to cradle my friend bleeding out in front of me.” Right there you learn about each person, from what they leave out and what they choose to emphasize. But reading all of them together, I think it gets you pretty close to the truth.

What’s left out of history is in many ways some of the most tragic parts of the book.

Absolutely. One of the Wager’s castaways was named John Duck, who was a free black sailor at the time. And he is somebody who survives going around Cape Horn in a violent typhoon, he survives one of the worst scurvy outbreaks ever recorded. He survives the shipwreck and then survives one of the longest castaway voyages. And yet, unlike so many others, he cannot tell his story. He is kidnapped and sold into slavery. I could find no record of what had happened to him. The absence of John Duck’s story underscores how many chapters of history can never be told. I was as haunted in many ways by the gaps in the story — by the John Ducks. What his story drove home to me was that the most sinister crimes and worse racial injustices have been largely excised from the American consciousness.

The Wager is clearly about the cost of empire and yet most of these people on the ship are just trying to stay alive or make some money, and remain seemingly unaware that they are in the service of an imperialist nation.

They are completely unconscious. When you read their narratives in the journals, these people are either dreaming about heroism or rising in the ranks of the military, or coming back with riches or simply trying simply to survive to get back to their families. And many of them are victims of this system.

Some are just folks off the street who get kidnapped or press-ganged into service in the navy.

Many of these people didn’t even want to go on the damn voyage. They’re forced onto the ship. And I do think the narrative reveals how empires survive by having so many citizens, consciously or not, who are complicit. So many of these people are complicit in a system that is also victimizing them.

I kept thinking about the Iraq war and America’s own imperial ambitions and folly.

I thought of Vietnam and the Gulf of Tonkin. The roots of the war are absurd. It’s called the War of Jenkins’ Ear, after Spanish forces allegedly cut off this British sailor’s ear. This story is kind of touted by imperialists as a pretext war. They were really just looking to expand the British empire. You realize how much history informs the present. We’re standing on history; it’s always there. In many ways this story is an illustration about how empires preserve power, not only by the stories they tell, but also the stories they leave out.

You’ve written about explorers who get lost in the Amazon and someone trying to cross-country ski across Antarctica. Why are you drawn to extreme stories?

Those circumstances are like these little laboratories that test the human condition. They end up revealing something, the kind of secret nature, the hidden nature of us, the good and the bad. And you can really see it play out. So I think they’re revelatory sorts of tales. Like in the Wager, you see these selfless acts, and then the same person, moments later, will commit a shocking act of brutality.

It all goes south very fast for the men of the Wager.

They descend into a Hobbesian state of nature. They start off with the imperial notion that Western civilization is somehow superior, yet they descend into warring factions and there are mutinies and murders, and a few even succumb to cannibalism. Which is probably why the British Empire wants the story to go away. They don’t want to admit that British officers didn’t behave like gentlemen, they behave like brutes.

Shifting gears, the Killers of the Flower Moon movie is set to premiere soon. What can you tell us about that?

It’s premiering at Cannes and out in the United States in October. I’m not a movie person, I’m a nerdy writer. But I feel very fortunate and blessed working with Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio and that whole production team has been pretty remarkable. You hope with these projects that you’re going to find people who have the same fierce commitment to the story as you do, which isn’t always easy. This is an important story to get right, because in the case of Killers of the Flower Moon, this is about an outrageous racial injustice that had been papered over in much of our collective consciousness.

Did the filmmakers work closely with the Osage nation?

That is the most important question to me. When people say, “What has the experience been like?” — like, I wrote a book, I did my best with that. And so, for me, the most important thing is that the people in the film work closely with the Osage nation. And, and to the best of my knowledge, the Osage were deeply involved in the production and the shaping of the story at every level. And the good news is after the experience of filming Killers of the Flower Moon, Scorsese and DiCaprio asked if we can team up again for a film about the Wager. I was like, “Oh, yeah, that sounds good to me!” [Ed. note: DiCaprio’s rep would not confirm if this was in the works.]

OK, so, you’ve written about the Amazon, the shipwreck of the Wager, and a deadly trek across Antarctica on skis. How would David Grann do in any of these experiences?

I’m like a little nerdy guy. I’m basically half-blind, bald, out of shape — at this point, sadly, an older gentleman. The idea for me to go exploring is the most preposterous thing in the world.

I can say that not very much about him has changed during that time. His love of nature is as steadfast as it was then, as is his refusal, all his life, to deviate from his principles. When I was working with him at Patagonia, Yvon didn’t care about conventional business wisdom; he cared about creating his ideal of what a great company should be: excellent quality, authentic stories, and focused on “making clothes for all of us”—that is, especially for the hardcore users. He managed to do that. Patagonia is a company that people look up to and marvel at because it is a genuine reflection of who Yvon is. Many people were surprised when he and the family decided to give away the company to defend the planet and combat climate change last year. No one else had ever done anything like it. But Yvon is used to going against the grain. For him, it was just bringing things full circle.

I don’t remember when I met Chris Black, but it feels like I’ve known him all my life, and maybe that’s because in a way, I have. At least, the portion of my life in which I figured out who my adult self was becoming. We used to grab lunch frequently when he lived in New York (he's currently based in L.A.), discussing anything and everything from the week’s debauchery to music and restaurants, but probably my favorite pastime was engaging with Chris on something we can both agree on: hating. We’d discuss brands and people that were doing things well, sure, but especially those that were doing it poorly. If you’ve followed Chris online, you’ve seen his extensive and niche set of references, things he prides himself on, and things he’s built a career on. Whether you like his or not, he’s a lesson in taste and the power of beating one’s own drum. There’s no one like Chris, and while he’s an open book, there’s also a vagueness to his digital imprint and what specifically makes him successful.

Below, Chris and I discuss what his company Done to Death Projects actually does, why buying new clothing is corny, and more.

I've seen this question asked of you before, but even I couldn't answer it, so let's establish Chris Black for readers. What do you do for a living, and what are some of your current clients?

I'm the co-host of How Long Gone, a podcast I do with my friend Jason Stewart, but I also have a company called Done to Death Projects. We consult with fashion brands on strategy and creative and a little bit of everything. Right now, there’s J. Crew, some Stüssy, a handful of other things. We keep it moving. And I also write. I have a column for New York Magazine’s The Strategist where people ask me questions and I try to answer them nicely. I also contribute to Air Mail pretty often, just about stuff that I'm interested in.

We joked a few times that you might not have five outfits for this, and through humor comes truth. How have you pared your wardrobe down and why?

I don't even know if it's about paring it down. It's about wearing the same thing over and over. I'll pack a giant suitcase for a two-week trip and half of those clothes come back clean. I really only want to wear vintage clothes. That is what I feel the best in, whether it's stuff I've had for a really long time or it's stuff that I'm buying because it speaks to me. The new clothes proposition, unless it's footwear or a special blazer or something formal, it's not as exciting.

What do you think that connection is with the vintage?

I think I am a little bit nostalgic and I look backwards more than I should, probably. If something really speaks to me aesthetically and culturally, then I feel drawn to it. A lot of that comes back to buying a Pet Shop Boys or a Gorilla Biscuits or an REM T-shirt because these are all things that are important to me. A cable knit sweater isn't going to have the same effect. I just think wearing new clothes is corny. I think the thought of wearing an outfit where everything is brand new just doesn't feel cool. It doesn't feel right to me. If I have something I love, I'm going to wear it out. There's stuff I wore today that I've had for a really long time. I have a vintage Hermes tie, but if I see a new Charvet tie that I really like, I'm going to buy that because it's a special occasion kind of thing. If I'm going to get a suit, it's going to be Drake's or it's going to be Our Legacy, because that stuff has to be new. That's where my brain goes. But jeans, T-shirts, sweatshirts, coats, it's all good—it exists and it's been done right.

As I'm aging, I used to have this thing where I’d get something shiny and new, I'd think, ""Alright, I can't really wear this much. I don't want to fuck it up."" And as I've gotten older, it’s, ""I have to wear my gear. And whatever happens to it, like an oil stain…”

It doesn't matter. Nothing matters. That's the thing. I think that the preciousness is probably what turns me off. I want everything in my life to feel lived in, whether that's the couch you're sitting on or it's a sweatshirt I'm wearing, or it's these shoes I've had for fucking 10 years, I like stuff to feel lived in because it feels like mine.

Where do you get inspiration for creative direction?

All the good stuff, bro. The beauty of aging is that the stuff that you grew up with, whether stylistically and culturally, usually comes back around. The stuff that I was really into in late high school and my early twenties, all of that is back to an extent, whether it's a certain style of photography or a certain style of dressing. I think everybody's wearing a lot of vintage clothes. Everybody's wearing something a little preppy and infusing that with the opposite of that. If you've been doing something long enough, it just comes to you. I know what I like and I'm very sure about that, so when I see something I haven't seen before that speaks to me, I instantly know I like that and catalog that. It's not rocket science. It's just having a point of view.

How about inspiration in terms of your own sense of personal style?

Working with J.Crew has been really interesting because it's having access to all those catalogs and being in those rooms and seeing the stuff. ""Oh, this is actually how I want to dress."" Because, I've said this before, but when you're in middle school and high school, you rebel against your parents, and I was wearing fucking giant pants and I looked fucking crazy. I remember telling my mom, ""I'm going to look like this forever. This is how I look."" Now, I basically dress like my dad, or how my mom wanted me to, which is basically Southern preppy. I've put my own spin on it from living in New York for so long and now living in L.A., but I think that that's who I really am, and I think when you accept that, dressing feels more natural. When you accept who you really are and what really inspires you and you don't try to play the game and keep up, that's when it comes off, and I think that's pretty clear to the viewer as well.

That’s what I love about being back in New York, just seeing these fucking freaks walk down the street and look amazing. It's that kind of unconventional beauty and different takes on style that, to me, is really native to New York because it attracts a certain kind of person from all over the world, and there's nothing more inspiring to me than that. That's the problem with L.A. Everybody looks like shit. No one cares. I get it, it's hot and you're in a car. It's a different proposition, but New York is really invigorating and it really helps me do my job.

What are some clothing brands you're into right now and why?

Carter Young's great. He's a young guy from New York. I just met him and instantly thought, ""I want to buy whatever you're selling. You have amazing taste. You're wise beyond your years. You're really doing this. You're excited about it. It's infectious."" When I was in Stockholm, I met these guys from a tailoring brand called Saman Amel and they blew my mind. I went to their atelier. It was fucking beautiful, just so dialed. They had such great personal style. They were really nice. They were really accommodating to me. They're making me a jacket right now. So cool. Drake's, of course. I wear that stuff all the time and I preach it all the time because I think they're the modern version of what I think I want to wear. When I think about stuff in my head and then I look at their website, they have it. J. Crew. Obviously, I'm biased, but I wear J. Crew a lot and I really like it, and I think [men’s creative director] Brendan [Babenzien] and I have a lot of commonalities when it comes to style and he actually knows how to make really good products, and obviously it's priced well. And then Stüssy, too. Honestly, Stüssy, to me, scratches a certain itch for stuff that might be a little more trendy, but it's so well priced and it lasts a long time and it fits me. It's easy. Our Legacy gets really funky for me sometimes, but when it's a little more pared back, it's really good.

But dude, that Bottega leather shit has me twisted. I want to buy a $7,500 leather flannel. I've never wanted anything more, but I've stopped myself because I know I will never wear that. I worked with Thom Browne for a long time, so I wear a lot of Thom Browne and nothing makes me feel like that. Obviously, a suit makes you feel like something, but when it feels like a uniform and when you're with other people who are wearing it, it's really empowering. When I put that on, I feel like I'm fucking bulletproof. It's a different feeling and it's hard to explain to people because some people think it's extreme, but then when you start wearing it every day, it's really not. It's gray and it's simple. APC is really good, again, and it's nice to see, really simple, really straightforward, really well priced. I also buy a lot of Lemaire. I really like Lemaire. It gets a little flowery sometimes, but I bought three of the same V-neck sweater that they make. And The Row. [My girlfriend] Alex buys me stuff from The Row because that's what she wants me to wear. I got these amazing black leather boat shoes that are just something I didn't realize I was looking for. And then my plane outfit is a pair of The Row pants because they look so nice. They're black, the material's amazing, but they're elastic waist and they have a real fly. They're the perfect pants. I have a raincoat, too. The really simple stuff that they make is really good and absolutely worth the money, I think.

It was while perusing postcards in Santiago nearly 30 years ago that Thomas Power came across one of Chile’s awe-inspiring Torres del Paine National Park. “I thought, ‘Blimey, what’s that?’” says Pura Aventura’s CEO and co-founder.

Power is now fronting a business — the UK's first specialist tour operator to achieve B Corp certification — which harbours aspirations of building towards a £20m business and recruiting staff five times its current levels after the pandemic curtailed the travel industry.

Brighton-based Pura Aventura designs family, walking and nature holidays to Latin America, Spain, Portugal, and Antarctica, all with a sustainable slant stemming from Power’s time as a tour guide for US companies in the mid 90s taking high school children on educational tours across Europe.

With a “pocketful of dollars”, the now 52-year-old would spend winters in South America and even set up a cafe in Mexico. However it was Chilean Patagonia’s national park that changed his life. “I thought ‘why didn’t I know more about this place?’ It was utterly beautiful,” Power adds.

Back in the UK, Power felt he was unemployable. “I was at a low and had an unsympathetic partner. She asked what I wanted to do. I told her I wanted to take people to Chile. She said, ‘Well, do it.’”

A chance meeting and five-hour chat with a park guide, fellow co-founder Diego Martin, after missing his boat across a lake subsequently sparked Pura’s journey. “I can’t stress how ignorant I was at running a business,” admits Power. “But there is evangelical passion for Chile, Spain and Costa Rica and as you get to know the countries you have to want to share the love. That’s never shifted.

“You need a lot of resilience, ignore the no’s and push on. That’s been the secret to longevity, the energy, passion and persistence. It's much more important than me. The mission is the priority.”

It’s a philosophy Power adapted to when he was accepted on Goldman Sachs’ 10,000 Small Businesses programme five years ago. “It was a phenomenal experience in terms of upskilling and a turbo boost for running a business,” he says. ""Many of us had been through versions of a business. Today, we are just starting Pura version four.”

The travel specialist's first version was, he admits, well intentioned. “A hobby with three guides and a similar outlook, lack of skills and bumbling along for the best part of ten years,” is Power’s recollection of the company's early years. “V2 was about concentrating on margin. V3 came after Goldman Sachs and we grew phenomenally fast.”

Then came Covid and an industry effectively banned from trading for 18 months.

“Through it all was our direct relationship to the places,” recalls Power, as the company took stock. “Yet we were always really good at producing extraordinary holidays that nobody else could copy as we were militant not to follow a path and a classic tour operator model. We weren’t a reseller of somebody’s else's product. We would never do that.

“We knew exactly how we wanted to share the places we wanted to share. It was a desire to have true control of product and experience and cut out the middle people that created complexity. Once you master that, you’re left with something unique and a reason to be in the market.

“You have to keep learning, understanding that you know sod all, keep being a sponge and absorbing it.”

This has all come amid the pound falling to a 37-year low against the dollar last September, when Pura’s margins took a 20% hit just as they opened their South America itineraries.

Despite the barriers over the last three years, Pura know that they offer unique and genuine trips, one with deep-rooted local connections and few departures every week to avoid unguarded interactions with other travellers.

In an age where travel plays a major part on social media with paid influencers, Pura rely on press, word of mouth and clients being advocates of their mission.

“You start by being consistently exceptional,” says Power. “Once people have been on our trips, they go, ‘I get it now’ and understand why it’s different.”

With the travel economy back up and running, Pura's 'scale of challenge' is growing to 30% beyond where the company was placed in 2019. Power cites Pura version four shifting from current staffing of 12 to 60 in the next few years, coupled with 40% year-on-year growth and building towards a £15-20m business.

“That’s on the back of three versions of mistakes and keeping on learning. Version 4 is learning enough lessons and how much more we need to learn. That’s the exciting thing.""

As one of the first UK travel outfits to become B Corps certified, the growing membership has now rallied to a combined tune of £100m revenues within that group. “That’s impact,” says Power.

“We want to be small giants. Where we operate we go deep, rather than broad. Where we operate we have real impact.”

Business courses

“The Goldman Sachs programme was a four-month course with 30 businesses across the UK and no competing verticals. We were put through the mincer and it was effectively a condensed MBA. The resource thrown at it is unbelievable, plus you’re in a room with other business owners.

“The imposter syndrome is the one thing that connects you all. It makes you realise that I am good at marketing or abysmal at people and culture or finance. You just shine a light on it and it’s all building towards a business growth plan. It was intensely practical.

Five years later my network is still going strong and the impact and ramifications are phenomenal. I am still in a WhatsApp group and I was recently thanking them for help on a recent project.”

But marketers are also looking at the tried and true workhorses of brand awareness: social media platforms. New research has revealed some of the major social media marketing trends to watch heading into the second half of the year.

The Global Social Media Trends Report from HubSpot and Brandwatch has discovered that a slight majority of marketers (51%) planned to increase their spend with Meta-owned Instagram, where they found the largest return on investment and where they saw the most growth potential.

TikTok came in second, but despite its growing popularity only 19% of marketers expected to spend more on the platform.

“Instagram has proven to be the best source of ROI, engagement and quality leads (tied with Facebook),” according to the report. “Marketers also feel that the Instagram algorithm is the most accurate, and that it’s the best place to grow a brand audience.”

In total, 1,283 global social media marketers and more than 600 U.S. consumers took part in the study, which was conducted at the end of 2022.

“We see Instagram as a platform that offers better linkage to driving sales conversion opportunities, as well as offering a balance of shopper and brand audiences in comparison to TikTok,” explained Sebastian Micozzi, svp of digital transformation at Bacardi.

Savvy marketers should embrace these new tools as complementary to irreplaceable human elements of marketing. Carrie Parker, CMO, Brandwatch

“As a portfolio of premium spirits brands, we have to be mindful of following local regulations as well as considering potential brand safety risks around consumers of legal drinking age, both of which we feel satisfied with on Instagram and Meta’s platforms generally. As a space for displaying our creative content and for receiving data back to inform future planning, it also continues to beat the competition,” he added.

Community building

Nine in 10 social media marketers felt their online community building had become an “absolutely essential” contributor to success, while 1 in 5 of consumers surveyed said they had joined or participated in an online community within the previous three months.

A quarter (25%) of the marketers said, for community building, Instagram and Facebook are equally popular and described them as the “most effective” platforms. The next most popular was YouTube with 14%, TikTok with 10%, Twitter with 7% and LinkedIn with 6%.

“Successful” brand communities cited included those developed by Canva, Shopify, Peloton, Starbucks, Patagonia and Apple.

“Almost all marketers will invest more time in communities in 2023,” stated Ian Ferguson, Brandwatch’s community platform manager, adding that these were now where customers sought out peer validation and content.

The rise of micro influencers

As predicted around the Super Bowl earlier this year, brands are expected to move away from using celebrity ambassadors and turn to micro influencers instead.

Eight in 10 marketers said they would have a creator or influencer as the face of their brand in 2023 to drive discovery. Only 1 in10 said they were working with either mega influencers or celebrities with more than 1 million followers.

The use of #sponsored in posts also reached a new high at the end of last year with more than 900,000 posts recorded in November. Instagram was cited as the platform most marketers (27%) planned to use for influencer collaboration. That was followed by Facebook (19%), YouTube (18%), TikTok (15%), LinkedIn (6%) and Twitter (5%).

Meanwhile, 21% of consumers between 18-54 said they had made a purchase based on the recommendation of an influencer, and 1 in 4 said they followed a virtual influencer too.

Video content

The use of short-form video across TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels was also cited as driving business results, with one-third (33%) of marketers planning to invest in it this year to target Gen Z and millennial consumers.

“In 2023, to save money, marketers can lean into one of the big trends in short-form video—low budget, casual videos. You don’t need expensive full-studio production to be hip right now. Your smartphone, a sense of humor and a call to action might be all it takes to create the perfect video for your brand,” commented Justin Pohl, associate marketing manager of content and social strategy at HubSpot.

Just 11% of marketers planned to produce long-form video content, while 10% will look to live audio chatrooms such as Twitter Spaces or Clubhouse, and 9% to virtual and augmented reality.

Social media as a search platform

With TikTok now competing with Google as a search engine for Gen Z, the report claimed that 87% of social media marketers think more consumers will turn to social media when searching for brands instead of search engines. It claimed that almost a quarter (24%) of consumers between 18-54 were using social media first, growing to more than a third (36%) when it came to Gen Z.

The marketers cited Instagram, Facebook and YouTube as the platforms with the best search capabilities that brands should optimize for across social media.

Speaking to Adweek, RyanAir’s head of social and creative content Michael Corcoran said social media is “moving so fast” and advised brands to think “more strategically” rather than jump on any new technology.

“It’s not all the same for all brands,” said Corcoran. “For some, that focus should be on paid only, some on customer experience and others a content play, that then evolves when impact can be proven. What happens are diluted attempts at too many things without the resources to focus on something that has business impact. Let’s start there first.”

AI interest grows

Conversations about the potential impact of generative AI reached a social media peak in January at almost 300,000 mentions. This was supported with interest in image creator Dall-E and other tools like Canva’s Magic Write.

Marketers are now growing their own understanding of how the technology can support their social media and marketing strategies across generating posts, email marketing and content creation.

“AI is reshaping marketing with new applications elevating everything from copywriting to personalization,” said Carrie Parker, chief marketing officer for Brandwatch. “While some may worry that AI will replace elements of their craft, savvy marketers should embrace these new tools as complementary to irreplaceable human elements of marketing instinct, creativity and empathy.”

Social shopping drives demand

Interest in social shopping is also expected to remain a growth area. Brandwatch Consumer Research analyzed conversations on the topic to examine generational differences. While Gen Z cares about shipping, service and knowing more about the company they’re buying from, millennials are interested in deals and discounts while using a range of platforms from Amazon to Pinterest and Instagram.

From both generations, 1 in 5 had bought a product directly through social media in the previous three months.

“The future of marketing is no longer about interrupting what people are interested in, it’s about being what people are interested in,” said Julie Lock, marketing director for the U.K. and Ireland at HubSpot.",[],

https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/sustainability/rothys-bottle-bill-new-york-recycling/,When Marketing Gets Political,"Rothy’s latest campaign isn’t about its recycled plastic ballet flats or brightly coloured tote bags. It’s a week-long marketing blitz aimed at galvanising support for a New York state recycling bill.

On Sunday, the footwear and accessories brand took out a full-page ad in The New York Times, throwing its weight behind efforts to improve recycling rates by updating the state’s 40-year-old bottle collecting scheme. This week, its social channels will feature posts on the “Bigger, Better Bottle Bill.” visitors to the company’s e-commerce site will find details on how they can get in touch with state legislators to voice their support, and the company’s Nolita store will multitask as a call centre.

The initiative is the first effort from Rothy’s new advocacy arm and a sign of the shifting relationship between fashion, politics and marketing.

The industry is already awash with social impact and eco-marketing claims, fuelled by a generation of consumers who want brands to take a stance on big issues. But brands’ splashy campaigns have often lacked follow through and jaded consumers increasingly expect more. That’s beginning to blur the lines between political advocacy and marketing as some businesses see an opportunity to demonstrate they not only stand for certain values, but are actively working to change the system in support of them.

To be sure, the fashion industry does plenty of lobbying behind the scenes on a variety of issues, mostly through trade groups such as the National Retail Federation in the US or Euratex in Europe. A handful of companies, like Patagonia and Beautycounter, have built advocacy into their brand. But it’s still quite unusual to see a fashion company throw its marketing clout behind a specific piece of legislation as Rothy’s has with the New York Bottle Bill. It may not be for long.

“Consumers want brands to connect to something deeper than just what they sell,” said Rothy’s chief marketing officer Jamie Gersch. “It’s not enough to talk about it and we wanted to make sure we were using our platforms to encourage others to participate with us.”

Moving the Needle

New York’s Bigger Better Bottle Bill aims to expand the state’s existing bottle collection programme to more types of containers and increase the payout for returns and handling. Advocates say it will reduce litter, improve recycling rates and support the marginalised community of canners who make a living gathering up and returning New York’s discarded bottles.

At the moment, deposits for bottle returns are set at just five cents, a number that hasn’t changed since the 1980s. Glass bottles (which often break in the trash and make it so that nothing discarded alongside them can be recycled) aren’t covered by New York’s current bottle bill. The proposed update would change that and increase deposit rates to 10 cents. Similar policy changes in other states have boosted redemption and recycling rates.

Rothy's new ad campaign calls on New Yorkers to support an update to the state's bottle collection and recycling programme. (Rothy's)

Rothy’s campaign comes weeks before the bill, which has widespread support from environmental and community organisations, is expected to go to vote. The brand’s hoping to raise awareness and support for the update with accessible, tongue-in-cheek messaging like “give a dime about plastic.”

“I think it will have a pretty big impact,” said Ryan Carson, environmental campaign coordinator at New York Public Interest Research Group, adding that the bill has the potential to be “transformative” in how New York handles waste.

Mixed Motives

For Rothy’s, which estimates it’s turned more than 159 million plastic bottles into shoes and bags, backing the bill was a no-brainer. But while the brand’s messaging in support of recycling is clear, it also touches on an increasingly contentious debate around how fashion brands should be talking about their use of repurposed plastic.

At issue is the fact that while plastic bottles can churn through a recycling system multiple times, once the PET they’re made from is transformed into polyester, it can’t be easily recycled again. And while there’s an abundance of disused plastic in the world, recycled PET is more limited and demand is growing rapidly thanks to a multitude of sustainability-focused corporate commitments to shift away from virgin plastic.

Apparel, unlike water bottles, also gets run through washing machines, where synthetic fibres leach microplastics into waterways. Proposed anti-greenwashing rules in Europe say fashion brands should be explicit about these trade-offs when promoting recycled polyester products.

Rothy’s shoes last a long time and do a better job of keeping plastic out of landfill than single-use water bottles, which still have short lifecycles even if they can be reconstituted multiple times, said Saskia van Gendt, Rothy’s head of sustainability.

The brand is also working on ways to close the loop on its shoes. It launched a take-back scheme in 2021 and rolled it out to all its stores last year. Returned products are taken apart so the polyester uppers can be recycled into new yarn. The insoles, midsoles and outsoles (made from foam, rubber or another kind of plastic) are ground down for use in carpet backing, insulation or athletic flooring. But the company has yet to really crack how to turn old shoes back into new ones, or introduce products containing “twice-recycled” yarn.

“We don’t have all the answers,” said Gersh. “[The bottle bill is] really promoting the idea that until plastic and single-use plastic goes away, how do we use it for good?”

A New Age of Advocacy

With more environmental and social impact regulation coming down the pipe, it’s likely to become more common to see brands taking big stands on environmental and social policy, particularly when their business interests, consumer values and policy efforts align, experts said.

For instance, resale site Vestiaire Collective has coupled a ban on ultra-fast fashion introduced last year with support for policies that would make brands responsible for their clothing waste (a bit like a bottle bill for fashion).

Companies interested in publicly wading into policy debates should keep in mind lessons from earlier waves of brand activism: authenticity and consistency are key, as is evidence of real commitment.

“You cannot fool the consumer,” said Vestiaire’s chief sustainability and inclusion officer Dounia Wone. “If you want to embrace a cause, take action… [and] it cannot just be for commercial reasons or marketing.” Like Rothy’s sustainability chief, van Gendt, Wone has a background in government work.

For any company, there’s also a question over whether the policies it might be backing really address the issues it creates.

For the industry to stand a chance of meeting the tsunami of sustainability commitments made over the last few years, fashion brands should be advocating for policies that don’t simply put a sticking plaster over existing problems, but change the whole model, said Ken Pucker, a senior lecturer at the Tufts Fletcher School.

“Policy is the most effective lever to drive any kind of social or environmental progress,” said Pucker. But encouraging more recycling, for instance, is a “low-leverage solution, because the amount of crap we’re making, we’re not recommending changing that,” he said.

Rothy’s said it’s monitoring fashion-focused policy moves like the New York Fashion Act, but isn’t planning any further advocacy efforts at the moment.

“Consumers understand brands can’t get behind everything,” said Gersh. “This is a big effort for us … but there’s no way one brand can do it all.”

https://www.gq.com/story/best-casual-pants?yptr=yahoo,The Best Casual Pants for Men Will Make You Want to Renounce Sweats Forever,"Stumbling across one of the best casual pants for men when you least expect it is like finding a super-rare, exotic mammal rooting around in your garbage can. It feels inexplicable and a little bit miraculous. Take it from us, a group of people who spend way too much time pondering the state of our pants: finding the right pair of casual pants rarely comes down to happenstance.

So perhaps you're here, bleary-eyed and bone-weary, after a long, exhaustive search for a pair of wrinkle-resistant dress pants to buy before your next flight. Perhaps you find yourself in desperate need of a spiffy pair of business casual pants you can break in before the first in-person meeting you've had in over a year. Or perhaps, spurred by nothing more than a deeply-felt desire for change, you finally bade your ratty sweatpants adieu—sad!—and are eager to try something else. Anything else.

Whatever the reason, whatever the occasion, whatever the cut—slim fit, straight fit, classic fit, relaxed fit—there's a pair of pants here for you. Whether you're looking for sturdy twill chinos you can wear with your slubbiest T-shirts, heavily-pleated trousers you can wear with a big, bold, button-down, or newfangled cargos you can wear with everything else, the right pair of casual pants for men are calling your name. And luckily for you, you don't have to look far. Because we sifted through a near-endless array of pants (so, so many pants) to compile a list of all all the best options available today. If you didn't believe in miracles before, you might now.

Every Type of Non-Fleece Pant You'll Ever Need

Obvious—maybe too obvious. But if you googled such a general search phrase as ‘casual pants for men’, you'd better expect a completionist answer. Jeans have been around for well over a century and it's hard to imagine society without the indigo-dipped five-pocket pant. They were originally designed for hardworking Gold Rush hopefuls and eventually spread to the masses to reach heights few other garments have. Bring them back to their roots with some honkin' leather work boots, or rock them day-off mode with a hoodie and sneakers, or pair a light wash option with a button-up shirt and a tailored blazer. There's not a situation that the right pair of jeans couldn't slot into, which makes them a requisite for every closet.

Chino is a hearty twill fabric lauded for its military-grade sturdiness. Over the last half century or so, chino pants have evolved from standard-issue army fare to civilian-life staples, helped along by cosigns from notable prepsters and the Ivy League set, including one particularly dashing U.S. president with a penchant for summering in Hyannis Port. They still come in every shade of khaki imaginable, but these days some of the coolest pairs on the market subvert the fabric's neutral origins via unexpected colors or patterns—sometimes both. Not sure what to wear to an upcoming date/park hang/exploratory trip back into the office? Chinos are aways a safe bet.

Like chinos, khakis remain a perennial classic of casual American style. (Can't quite wrap your head around the difference? Chino is a fabric; khaki is a color.) Khakis derive their name from the particular shade of light brown that became ubiquitous in the U.S. after World War II, when returning GIs adapted the bottom half of their hard-wearing uniforms to the rigors of civilian life. Once relegated exclusively to off-duty fare, khakis—a color that now encompasses everything from plain Jane beige to mossy olive green—have long since crossed over into the realm of work-appropriate attire. In their simplicity, they remain a reliable template for designers' freakiest projections (just peep the swankified ghurkas below.)

It's tough to beat the cargo pant when it comes to sheer utility. Even in their simplest form, the ultra-practical and—you guessed it—military-inspired trousers include discrete pocket space aplenty, making them the pants you should wear when you want to run errands without lugging a mostly-empty tote around with you. Over the last few years, capital-D designers and big-box brands alike have updated the silhouette, tweaking the proportions and adding as many (or as few) pockets as they please. Which means it's easier than ever to find one in the perfect fit, whether you're looking for a relaxed version you can wear with trail-ready boots or a slimmer take cut to stack perfectly over a pair of simple kicks.

We know what you're thinking—dress pants are not casual pants. To that we say, “open up your mind, bro."" See, any pant can be a casual pant if you really use your head. (Jury's still out on whether that rule works the other way around, but the evidence so far doesn't look promising.) Separate your tailored trousers from their matching suit jacket and they can be free to a whole world of style possibilities. Dress pants can look surprisingly casual and fresh with a plain tee and a pair of canvas sneakers. Super billowy, paired with a breezy camp shirt and elevated leather sandals, and you're about ready for a summer vacay. The key is more simple than you think: treat 'em like any other pant in your closet.

Performance Pants

What do you get when you cross-breed the old-fashioned durability of your most weathered jeans with the forgiving comfort of your favorite joggers? A new generation of performance-oriented pants, genetically modified to be harder, better, faster, and stronger than any other pair in your wardrobe. If you prefer your pants described using more tech-y jargon than a standard IPO filing, these wrinkle-free, moisture-wicking bad boys are for you.

Work Pants

It was nearly three years ago that GQ collectively freaked for Dickies' sturdy-as-hell painter's pants. Since then, prices for Carhartt's quintessential double-knees have reached truly astonishing heights, and every cool guy in a trucker hat and lug-soled loafers wants in. Thankfully, the style's popularity doesn't mean it's lost any of that initial luster—if anything, its sustained appeal means you can now scoop a pair without dinging your credit card. Every brand worth its salt makes a version of the silhouette, from longtime stalwarts of the workwear scene to some of the hippest names in the streetwear universe. Find one that's right for your budget and never look back.

If there's one thing we remember from grade school it's that the sports coaches all had sick on-field style. And while the aerodynamic shades and New Balance trainers accounted for much of their swag, it was really the swishy track pants that set their whole style ablaze. Today, track pants are hotter than ever thanks style gods like A$AP Rocky and designers like Grace Wales Bonner. They're usually made in some sort of synthetic material like a windbreaking nylon, or a bouncy poly blend, and feature extra panelling and even bold stripes running down the outseam. Extra points for track pants with bold colors and dizzying patterns.","['Condé Nast', 'Gerald Ortiz', 'Michella Oré', 'Avidan Grossman']",2021-09-08 12:00:00+00:00

Adventure jars began as a simple way for two women to find a work-life balance but ended up being so much more than that.

Working as two corporate employees for a tech company in California, Kaysie Nielson and Tosh Swain found it hard living in a new place and separating their work from their free time, especially during the pandemic.

“Kaysie made this adventure jar that had a whole bunch of ideas for us to explore Orange County because we were new to the area and wanted to try new things,” Swain told the Deseret News. “When we first started thinking about how we could balance our time with work in a more meaningful way, we contemplated making adventure jars for different cities for people to get out of their own comfort zone.”

As Nielson and Swain realized how this idea helped them achieve a work-life balance, they eventually decided to quit their corporate jobs and turn their adventure jars into the Utah business and marketplace called Exploring Not Boring, where creators and adventurers can collaborate and explore the world around them.

“Crazy doesn’t even begin to describe the journey that we’ve been on but now it feels genuinely rewarding to be where we are and it’s exciting to be building this marketplace,” Swain said.

But Nielson and Swain aren’t the only Utah entrepreneurs that started their business seeking this balance in their lives.

What motivates Utah entrepreneurs?

In fact, most Utah entrepreneurs have started their businesses because they desire a better work-life balance, according to recent findings.

OnDeck analyzed recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s latest Annual Business Survey on why people across the U.S. start their own businesses and found Utah to be the leading state for entrepreneurs who start businesses to find a better balance between “work and family” and also for those seeking “flexible hours.”

OnDeck

James Barnes, creative and research team lead of NeoMam Studios, told the Deseret News, “A method similar to the location quotient was used in the study to determine which reason for starting a business was deemed much more important in a particular state or metro compared to the country’s overall average.”

Story continues

Barnes continued, “For example, 65.4% of business owners in Utah said ‘balance work and family’ was very important to them as a reason for starting their business. This was 1.13 times higher than 57.6% of business owners who said it was very important to them in the United States overall. This means its location quotient was 1.13, and it was the highest of all reasons in Utah, which is why it was deemed Utah’s most distinct reason for starting a business.”

The Deseret News previously reported that many tech workers have come back to Utah to enjoy the outdoors in their off time from working.

“Now we have real evidence that ... this has been an important piece of the growth we’ve had here,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said. “I was especially amazed at some of the numbers, including that 85% of tech sector workers who chose to stay in Utah despite a higher salary offer elsewhere, said that outdoor recreation was the reason they chose to stay here.”

The difference between East Coast and West Coast motivations

Jim Granat, co-president of OnDeck, told the Deseret News, “The regional differences likely come down to a range of factors. Culture, business environment and a family history of small business ownership can all play a role.”

The Deseret News reported that especially after the pandemic, some people in Utah wanted to be home with their families and working more flexibly to enjoy a balance between their responsibilities and living a present life.

Nielson told the Deseret News, “We were just working a ton and weren’t able to explore much at the time, especially with the pandemic stopping the world.”

For many during quarantine, the days would repeat themselves: wake up, work remotely, stay inside and find a way to not be bored till you woke up the next day.

“We weren’t happy giving all of our time to this company. ... We’re very passionate, driven people and we kind of look at life as if you have this one life to live, you should do so meaningfully and you should put your time into things that matter and people who matter,” Nielson said.

While Utah seems to be home for entrepreneurs like Nielson and Swain, who want to create a better work-life balance, the state didn’t rank as high in other categories, according to OnDeck.

When asked why Utah isn’t one of the top states for the “best avenue for ideas” category, Granat said, “A potential reason is that employers in Utah are creating space for their employees to explore their ideas so they don’t feel the need to go solo to do it.”

Where Utah ranked low in some areas, different states would fill the top spots. OnDeck reported that:

East Coast entrepreneurs were motivated by “family connections such as a family business or role model.”

West Coast entrepreneurs were more motivated by “family responsibilities” and “freedom to work.”

New York and Delaware were the only two states that had “couldn’t find a job” as a main reason for owning a business.

Analysts found that people were “reluctant to take a new job on a lower rung” after losing their positions prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Deseret News reported that one of the most popular Utah-based cookie companies, Crumbl, has expanded all across the nation, saying, “Fans of the brand may not realize that before Crumbl could take over suburban strip malls nationwide, it first had to conquer the cookie landscape of its home state, Utah.”

Crumbl expanded as a business from one shop to 786 shops across the U.S. in less than six years.

Other companies such as the popular outdoor brand Patagonia began in California but have expanded to Utah and other parts of the nation as it has trended in outdoor fashion.

For Exploring Not Boring, Swain and Nielson have visions to take their Utah-based business and expand to the rest of the globe.

“The goal is to be global, but of course we’ve got to start smaller and build our reputation up, because we are both from Utah and we already had a lot of connections here,” Swain said. “We already have partners throughout the world from Japan, Australia, India, Peru, Columbia and even partners in different parts of the U.S. like Florida and Orlando.”

The importance of knowing what motivates entrepreneurs

The Commerce Institute reported that on average, there are 4.4 million businesses that are started every year. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau showed that 5,044,748 new businesses began in 2022.

“Finding the reasons why people start businesses and the location where they do are useful statistics in learning the characteristics of business owners,” Barnes said.

Barnes continued, “Along with the other data included in the Census Bureau’s survey, these can be used by different government and private sectors for various purposes such as assessing business assistance needs, determining programs that could help promote activities of disadvantaged groups, and allocating program resources.”

Granat also said that these findings could be useful for future entrepreneurs to see what areas may align with their vision for business goals.

“Small business owners are some of the most passionate people you’ll meet. We wanted to better understand the drive that got them started and keeps them going,” Granat said.",['Madison Selcho'],

How We Test Duffels and Weekenders

We test duffels and weekenders for four main attributes — capacity, design, portability, and durability. Before we begin a test, we consult experts in the luggage space to get their input on what makes an ideal bag. We'll also survey the T+L editors to get their take as our editors are constantly monitoring the latest and greatest in the luggage space. With all this intel in mind, we'll then conduct internet research to find the top bags available to buy at the moment, and purchase them for testing.

During testing, we follow a rigorous and consistent methodology to make sure that all products, regardless of brand, price point, or style, are evaluated fairly. We start by inspecting the bag for surface-level observations, such as any useful features that stand out, the style and aesthetic, and more. Then, we weigh and measure each bag to make sure the specs on the purchasing site are what you can actually expect. Next, we pack each bag with items you would need on a trip to test capacity: clothing, shoes, toiletries, cosmetics, and other essentials. Each bag is packed with the same types of items as a control variable of what we're able to fit. (In other words, we've ordered upwards of 50 of the same T-shirts, jeans, and other essentials.) We then evaluate how easy they are to carry — are the straps comfortable and well-placed? How long could you tote this around on a trip before it would become too heavy or cumbersome? Lastly, we test their durability by throwing them off of high surfaces and tossing them around. (While these softsided bags don't usually offer as much protection for your valuables inside as, say, a hardshell suitcase, we also want to check how well the bag itself holds up to wear and tear.)

Finally, we analyze all insights and data from each test to recommend the best products for your trip. Only when we decide we really love a product (and that it offers value for your money) do we recommend it to you.

A world away...

Though it might be hard to vacation these days without throngs of fellow travelers jostling around you, there are still some remarkably remote and pristine places to explore away from the crowds. From the stunning valleys of Albania to the wildlife-rich bays of Antarctica, here are some of Earth’s most unspoiled spots to marvel at.

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/chilean-circuit-hike-dientes-beagle-channel,This thrilling Chilean trek is the world’s southernmost hike,"Run your finger down a map to the far end of the Americas, and the final town you’ll encounter is Puerto Williams, a remote Chilean outpost on the Beagle Channel. Home to just 3,000 people—including scientists, naval officers, and Indigenous Yahgan fishermen—avid hikers know this place as the start of the southernmost trekking route on Earth.

The five-day Dientes Circuit around Navarino Island begins and ends in Puerto Williams, where feral horses and wayward cows roam windswept streets that hold a small collection of shops (mostly outdoor outfitters), lodgings (hostels and hotels), and restaurants serving king crab, the local specialty.

Of course, the real allure is above in the jagged pinnacles of the Dientes de Navarino mountain range. Here, intrepid hikers find dense forests of Nothofagus trees which lead, over the course of 33 miles, to peat bogs, lakes, and rugged alpine passes with views south toward Cape Horn, the last dot of land before Antarctica.

“Ten or 15 years ago you wouldn’t find anyone walking up there,” says Maurice van de Maele, president of the local tourism board. “This February there was a new record: 48 people departing in one day.” Of course, that’s a far cry from popular Patagonian hikes such as the W Trek, in Chile’s nearby Torres del Paine National Park, which has become so overcrowded you have to reserve campsites well in advance. For now, fewer than 2,000 people tackle the Dientes Circuit each year. Yet, even in this final frontier, tourism numbers are climbing.

In the next year, Puerto Williams will welcome a new multipurpose pier for Antarctica-bound expedition ships, as well as a passenger terminal at its small airport, making access easier than ever before.

Meanwhile, high-speed Wi-Fi and a shiny new research center have opened the town up to the wider world. Although the hostile climate at this latitude (the 55th parallel south) may keep numbers at bay, the Dientes Circuit seems primed for a larger audience.

‘It’s totally wild’

The Dientes Circuit dates back to the late 1990s when Australian adventurer Clem Lindenmayer developed the route for a Lonely Planet trekking guide. Little used in the ensuing years, it nevertheless developed a cult following that’s grown incrementally alongside Patagonia as a destination.

“I remember my first time doing this circuit and the freedom I felt,” recalls Jorge Barbero, founder of Explora Isla Navarino, which leads guided expeditions. “It’s like you’re the first person walking in these mountains because you don’t see a trail for much of the way—it’s totally wild.”

(Chile’s new national park offers a glimpse of life in the cosmos.)

The circuit begins with a rapid two-mile ascent to Cerro Bandera, a popular day hike among cruise passengers which provides sweeping views over the Beagle Channel. Then, through-hikers follow the Robalo Valley to Laguna del Salto, camping on the first night near a sinewy waterfall. Days two and three involve scrambling over rocky mountain passes, then sinking into wet beech forests to sleep alongside alpine lagoons. Magellanic bog moss makes the path here feel like walking atop a wet sponge, testing the limits of waterproof boots.

Day four is largely uphill, crossing the rocky and wind-battered Paso Virginia back to the north side of Dientes de Navarino to sleep in a sheltered forest below. Day five, by contrast, is mostly downhill toward Puerto Williams through a forest that buzzes with the tip-tapping of Magellanic woodpeckers.

“If the weather cooperates, this is a trip that’s actually quite modest,” Barbero says, noting that the milage and altitude gains aren’t terribly challenging. “But if it doesn’t, it can be much more complicated.” In Patagonia, it’s common to experience all four seasons in a single day. On Navarino Island, locals joke that you can have them all in an hour.

During the short hiking season (November to March), temperatures typically max out around 50 degrees Fahrenheit in Puerto Williams and drop well below freezing on mountain passes. Outside of peak austral summer (January and February), it’s not uncommon to wake up to a tent covered in snow, followed by an afternoon of blazing sun. By mid-March, those brave enough to endure snowstorms enjoy spectacular fall foliage.

A beaver problem

Much of the Dientes Circuit lies above the tree line where there’s no defined path. Yet, signposts every half-mile or so keep hikers on track. Forested areas pose different obstacles, including rambling roots, thick bogs, and prickly calafate bushes. The biggest challenge, though, is the beavers, whose dams reroute the trek each year.

Twenty Canadian beavers arrived on the Argentinian side of Tierra del Fuego, just across the Beagle Channel, back in 1946 to “enrich” the local economy with new industries in fur and castoreum (a gland used to make tinctures for perfume). With no natural predators, the population exploded.

There are now an estimated 60,000 beavers on Navarino Island alone, according to Miguel Gallardo of Navarino Beaver, who takes visitors on tours to see how beavers have destroyed the island’s otherwise pristine forests.

Gallardo is one of just a few people actively working to control the population, eliminating about 60 beavers each year for artisan crafts and culinary experiences. “The properties of beaver meat are actually quite good for humans,” he says, noting that it’s high in fiber and protein (though it does need a good sauce “to cut the bitterness”).

(The best way to combat invasive species? Eat them.)

Beavers create an ideal habitat for other introduced species, namely minks and muskrats, which Gallardo calls “a trilogy of destruction.” The former park ranger hopes an increase in tourism might finally prompt the government to pay more attention to the problem.

The promise and perils of tourism

A strategy to control the beavers remains elusive, but there are plans to make the trek itself more orderly. Currently, there are zero facilities beyond Puerto Williams. Yet, Cristina Altamirano, who heads the municipal tourism office, says there are funds to improve signage, construct dry toilets, and create emergency shelters by the end of 2024.

The infrastructure for tourism in Puerto Williams is growing, too. A new multipurpose pier will open in stages over the next three years with the aim of making this small town a major gateway for trips to Antarctica (companies like Silversea Cruises have already relocated ships here).

(Hunting for the world’s southernmost tree in Patagonia.)

Meanwhile, a passenger terminal will open this year at Guardia Marina Zañartu Airport, which receives six weekly flights (December to March) on Aerovías DAP from the regional Chilean capital of Punta Arenas. Visitors can also travel by boat from Punta Arenas in a spectacular 32-hour journey through the fjords of Alberto de Agostini National Park.

New cafés (Campero), craft breweries (Subantartica Beer House), and hotels (Fío Fío) have opened in recent years to cater to the growth, as has a striking new research institution, Centro Subantártico Cabo de Hornos, for the study of sub-Antarctic ecology. Yet, the town lacks lodgings and restaurants to accommodate more visitors.

David Alday, former president of the local Yahgan community, fears the island may be growing too fast. “The Yahgan community has been present here for thousands of years, and in that time, even when we were large in number, we never produced a great imbalance in the environment,” he says, adding that “the impact on the land is greater today.”

Alday isn’t against tourism; he owns the kayaking company Tánana, which offers excursions in the Beagle Channel showing visitors the seafaring legacy of the Yahgan, who, for nearly 7,000 years, lived further south than any other human population. He just wants tourism’s growth to be sustainable and in line with Yahgan principles of harmony and environmental preservation. “We have to be able to find some balance,” he says, “so that this town doesn’t overflow.”","['Mark Johanson', 'Published April']",

How We Test Checked Luggage

Every luggage test we do follows a consistent and rigorous methodology. We start by interviewing relevant experts in the industry — manufacturers, products designers, brand reps, and even pilots and flight attendants — to get their take on what to look for in luggage. Using those expert tips, we then do extensive internet research to find the top rated luggage items on the market, taking into consideration a variety of brands and price points, and we purchase those for our tests.

During testing, we start by noting any initial observations we like or don't like about it, such as any useful features that stand out, the style and aesthetic, and more. Then, we weigh and measure each bag — every ounce counts when it could save you money in overweight baggage fees, especially with checked luggage! Next, we pack the suitcases with clothing, shoes, toiletries, cosmetics, and a few breakable souvenirs to evaluate the capacity and organizational features of the suitcase. Then, to test how well they maneuver, we roll them across various surfaces, such as concrete floors, carpet, and cobblestone streets. Lastly, we test their durability by throwing them off of high surfaces and striking them with baseball bats to mimic the damage a bag might receive once it leaves your hands and is thrust from conveyer belt to cargo hold and more.

At the end, we analyze all insights and data to recommend the best products for your trip. Only when we decide we really love a product (and that it offers value for your money) do we recommend it to you.

One of the most inspiring initiatives for us at TIME over the past few years has been convening TIME100 honorees from around the globe. What began nearly two decades ago as an annual list of the world’s most influential people has become a community of leaders from across fields, who join together in venues from Singapore and New York City to Dubai and Los Angeles, to spotlight solutions toward a better future. At this year’s first gathering of TIME100s, in Davos, Switzerland, the overarching theme was the confluence of interconnected challenges, from climate and public health to democracy and equality. That is also the central theme running through the 2023 TIME100 list—starting with the most existential of challenges: climate change. This year’s list features a record 16 people defending the environment, including the new leaders of Australia, Colombia, and Brazil, all recently elected on a wave of pro-climate sentiment. Also counted among that group are scientists like Andrea Kritcher, whose experiments brought controlled fusion power closer to reality than ever before; Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard, who donated his company to the fight; and environmental-justice advocate Catherine Coleman Flowers. We also include cultural titans like Angela Bassett, whom singer Tina Turner praises for always having “strength, determination, and big, big dreams,” and pioneers like Sam Altman, whose company released the generative artificial intelligence platform ChatGPT, advancing what Airbnb founder Brian Chesky calls in this issue “the most powerful tool ever created.” Recognized here too are Ozlem Tureci and Ugur Sahin, mRNA-vaccine trailblazers who led the way on COVID-19 jabs and are now turning to cancer vaccines with exciting results. And we may all someday owe a debt to physicist Edward Reynolds, who oversaw a successful mission to collide a small spacecraft with an asteroid in order to knock the latter off course. A passionate group of activists are also on this list, including Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, whose work continues to gain resonance as gun violence remains a tragically daily threat in America’s communities. Central to confronting the world’s shared challenges is the pursuit of truth, an endeavor increasingly under attack. We recognize three journalists who have taken great risks in the course of that duty. Elaheh Mohammadi and Niloofar Hamedi, courageous Iranian reporters, have been jailed over their crucial coverage of the protests against the regime. And the work of Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter facing bogus espionage charges for reporting on Russia, has galvanized supporters of press freedom around the world. We celebrate Evan’s commitment to our profession and join in calling for his immediate release.

We've tested hundreds of suitcases and bags — learn more about how we evaluate these products.

Travel + Leisure / Conor Ralph

To date, our travel experts and editors have tested more than 500 luggage pieces — both in our New York City lab and traveling out in the world — and we've sifted through insights and reviews of each product to find you the very best gear for your trips. Below are three main types of luggage we have tested and will continue to test regularly. Click on a category below to learn more about how we evaluate items from each category and learn more about our progress.

Be sure to check back, as we'll update this page as we test more.

How We Test Luggage

All our recommendations are based on rigorous, hands-on evaluation conducted both in our product testing lab in New York and by editors when they travel. We also interview experts in the luggage space — manufacturers, products designers, brand reps, and even pilots and flight attendants — to get their insider advice on what to look for in a piece of luggage. Based on our initial research, we scour the internet for the most popular and top-rated luggage items on the market to purchase those for our testing lab.

During testing, we follow a rigorous and consistent methodology to make sure that all products, regardless of brand, price point, or style, are evaluated fairly. We start by inspecting the bag for surface-level observations, such as any useful features that stand out, the style and aesthetic, and more. Then, we weigh and measure each bag so you know every inch and ounce to account for when preparing for a trip. Next, we pack each bag with all the essentials you may need on a trip. We'll take the packed bags and maneuver or carry them around various surfaces. (Is it easy to roll over cobblestone? Can you easily carry it up the stairs?) Lastly, we test the durability of each by throwing them off of high surfaces and pushing them off tables.

Story continues

Finally, we analyze all insights and data from each test to recommend the best products for your trip. Only when we decide we really love a product (and that it offers value for your money) do we recommend it to you.

We're getting nine new episodes in May, and while the last season came from Japanese creators, this time, the animated shorts come from all around the globe.

One of the writer/directors that appeared on the ""Star Wars: Visions"" panel was Gabriel Osorio, representing his Punkrobot animation studio in Chile.

Sheri Tingey told her story to producer Sarah Vitak for an episode of The Daily Rally podcast. It has been edited for length and clarity.

Then I got really sick. I couldn’t crawl across the floor. And I just kept thinking, Is this my life? I will never design again. All of this life was over.

I am here in Mancos, Colorado. It’s one of those one stoplight towns when you drive through, like, Oh, did I pass this place? It's a very eclectic mix of people.

I was sewing by five. By about the second grade, I got the hand me downs, and oh my God, I hated them. I would just take scissors and chop it all up, and I’d walk out the door. By about the fifth grade, I was making all of my clothing.

As a young child, I had terrible tourettes. I was dyslexic. I was all of these things. But that also gave me my window that I created through other ways. For me, it was fabrics and the outdoors. That became my lifelong love.

I fell in love with skiing and moved to Jackson Hole. I was a horrible waitress. I couldn’t do any of those things, and I started making ski clothing, just because I wanted something to wear, and I hated what was out there. That really started my first business. It just absolutely lit every candle that mattered to me.

During that time, I had also discovered kayaking. The minute I got it in a boat it was like, You’re home, girl. This, this is you, this is it. It’s everything that I had ever loved about the water. So I would spend the winter skiing and the summers kayaking. I would be on the first tram and would ski until three in the afternoon, and I would sew until midnight. In the summer, it was the same. I was kayaking all day. I ran 24-7. I never knew how to shut off those things.

Jackson Hole in those days was a real hotbed of outdoor design. I was probably the first one out there that was making really practical clothing. Doug Tompkins was there, John Simms from Simms Fishing. Yvon Chouinard lived there; he had the climbing business and then he started the clothing.

Story continues

Teton Mountaineering was the main mountaineering shop there in Jackson. I remember so distinctly, they had a celebration when this Patagonia catalog came out. I remember, I looked at it and a couple other people that were small little guys like me looked at it, and we went, We’re dead. This is it.

And it did happen that way. All of a sudden Patagonia went, and here came the North Face, and here came the others. And they got bigger and bigger and bolder, and all the little guys disappeared.

Then I got really sick. I’d had this flu, maybe two and a half weeks. I thought, I’m okay. And [my partner] Ralph and I went out to climb a thing called Irene’s Arete in the Tetons.

It’s about a 4,000-foot ascent up to the base of the climb, and then a 13-pitch climb. And that’s when the viral pneumonia came in. The next day, I was down, and I was down for two and a half months. Then the chronic fatigue came in.

I mean, I was on my hands and knees. It also had this component of your brain kind of going out the window. It was just this terrifying, horrifying thing and nobody could help me. I go to doctors and they just say, ""Well, go home and take an aspirin, because tests don’t show anything."" Within two months, I had to give up my business and skiing and boating and all these things. It all just left.

[My son] Thor was two at the time. I had nobody to watch him. I’d just lay on the floor, and he’d crawl over me. And I just kept thinking, Is this my life?

The chronic fatigue would ebb and flow and ebb and flow. You’d have years where you do work better and years where you just didn’t function. You wish you were dead, but you’re not gonna die from it.

Then we moved to Alaska. We had this good size dog team, which I could do because I could control the amount of energy I put out. Hop in the sled and the dogs take you.

Clothing was really junky for mushers. I could make something better. But I had to ask, Do I have the energy? When I was first sick, I couldn’t sew for 15 minutes. I would be so exhausted. Anybody that has ever dealt with chronic fatigue, knows if you either overdo yourself physically or mentally, you’ll crash, and you can crash for a day, or weeks, or months. Ten years in, that was probably the hardest thing I ever did, retraining myself how to recreate without exhausting myself, because it went so against everything in my personality. Whether it was skiing or kayaking or working on an art project, it was 24-7 until I crashed.

It was like, No, you’re gonna sew for 15 minutes and then you’re gonna walk away. Now you’re gonna sew for 30 minutes, you’re gonna walk away. You need to put it away at night and pick it up again.

Dr. Denton at Alaska Alternative Medicine Center saved my life. She said, ""You were 17 years getting in here, plan on at least 12 getting out, because you can’t go out too fast. You’ll fall down."" She was right. And my energy came back.

Within a year of that, Thor walked through the door with this dead boat from these trips that he’d done. And he asked me, ""Can you build me a boat?""

Pack rafts are boats designed to fit into a backpack. Building a pack raft is much closer to making clothing than it is to making boats. It really is a sewing technology.

You talk about times in your life when light bulbs go off. It was like, This is everything that I’ve ever cared about. All that I thought I had lost, and all that I thought was useless, just absolutely came and jumped in the basket. It was like the door just opened and said, ""Walk.""

I could never have run or become Alpacka had I not done that. I needed those years to retool myself to do what eventually came out to be that this is what you’re gonna do, girl.

I used to run the whole business, and thankfully now I don’t have to. I just design boats. I’m back in that element that I really care about, that it all comes down to, How good of a boat can you make? Not how beautiful a boat, but what’s the best boat you can come up with? And that’s way more interesting to my soul and to how I work.

I am so blessed to have had that second chance. If that had come ten years earlier, I would have still been too sick to do anything about it. And this time around is so much more enjoyable than the first time.

https://www.rollingstone.com/culture-council/articles/new-trends-to-spot-in-the-future-of-food-1234711283/,Five New Trends to Spot in the Future of Food,"Last month, I gathered with thousands of the world’s most exciting food brands for the world’s top events in the future of food. Starting in sunny Anaheim at Natural Products Expo West, then off to Austin’s iconic SXSW festival and finally to San Francisco’s Future Food Tech, I jumped through a whirlwind of tastings and visions of what our future food system could look like. Though none of us have a crystal ball, here’s my take on the top five future of food trends going on right now.

Regenerative Food

By far and away, the biggest trend we are seeing in food right now is “regenerative.” As I covered in my last article, even though the term regenerative has no legally defined meaning, the use of the word has increased by 113% in the past 12 months, so it was no surprise to see it everywhere — both good and bad. While I came across a number of brands at Expo West, such as Applegate Farms, which is owned by the renowned producer of SPAM, Hormel Foods, using the term to greenwash their processed meats, the industry also marked a huge milestone with the acquisition of regenerative snack brand Moonshot Snacks by Patagonia Provisions. With money flowing into the regenerative space and consumer demand growing, the regenerative trend doesn’t appear to be going anywhere. Nonetheless, it is only a matter of time before “regenerative washing” practices are brought into the public eye — just ask JBS, the world’s largest meat producer, which made history last month when the Better Business Bureau ordered them to stop misleading consumers with marketing around net zero climate goals.

Nostalgia Branding

What’s old is new again, as the world’s leading future of food brands are jumping on the nostalgia train! Not only are we seeing plant-based brands revive old marketing campaigns, such as Silk NextMilk’s nod to Got Milk?, but many of these brands are even making plant-based products to imitate childhood favors. This makes perfect sense, as the warmth and familiarity of nostalgia helps these new products navigate the complexities of consumer perceptions of food technology and science. These retro vibes could be spotted across both consumer brands at Expo West, such as Meati mycelium steaks, and even startup brands at Future Food Tech, such as Mellody plant-based honey. Given the Gen Z and Millennial fondness for nostalgia, it seems likely that future-of-food brands will continue to follow this trend as they roll out new climate-friendly, technology-powered food products. Editor’s picks

Make It With Science

In a funny twist to the simplicity of nostalgia, this year’s events also brought forth the most scientific and technology-advanced food products yet. With machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) no longer being just buzzwords, products debuted across the industry using these technologies, including brands like Climax Foods, which creates hyper-realistic plant-based cheese through machine learning, or Brightseed, which unlocks improved health benefits in food through AI. Until now, the intersection of these technologies and consumer benefits has yet to take off in the food industry. Now with a proof point, it will be interesting to see how these products are received in the market — and whether the pricey investment into AI and machine learning will ultimately be worth it. These early brands will certainly dictate whether this trend continues on or fizzles out.

Let’s Get Cultivated

There is no doubt that 2023 will be a watershed year for the cultivated space, as cultivated meat products (meat made from cells grown outside an animal) are expected to debut to the U.S. public later this year. But even though more than 100 cultivated meat companies now exist around the world, meat is not the only player in the game. While meat remains the industry’s foremost focus, clever innovators are now using the same technologies to recreate many of the world’s other biggest polluters in the food system. In just one day, I tasted products from startups cultivating everything from chocolate to caviar to coffee. Interestingly, cultivated meat continues to face an uphill challenge for consumer acceptance, but this same technology may find an easier pathway to the consumer through these other everyday food products — potentially helping boost overall acceptance of the technology.

Give Me Them Whole Cuts

Americana may be synonymous with a good old burger, but the reality is that this country runs on an entirely different meat: chicken. With chicken accounting for more than 95% of meat produced in the U.S., it was only a matter of time before meat-free whole cuts became the next big thing. Whether it was attending celebrity-packed SXSW parties with fungi-powered chicken skewers from Meati and plant-based chicken sliders from TiNDLE or walking the Future Food-Tech startup alley to see up-and-coming whole-cut innovations from India’s Demolish Foods, Spain’s Novameat or France’s Umiami, it is clear that meat-free whole cuts are having a moment. It’s incredible to see how far these products have come in a short period of time, and as the leading meat category, it would not be surprising to see meat-free whole cuts overtake meat-free burgers in only a few years’ time.

With a rapidly changing climate and a young, progressive consumer base taking hold, there is no doubt that not only how we sell food, but what we sell as food, will change. There is no future reality where the foods of today stand the test of time, but what that future food system looks like remains to be seen. By next year’s conference circuit, it will be interesting to see which of these trends will have become a long-term change in how we eat, and which will be a momentary blip in time. Only time will tell!",['Jennifer Stojkovic'],2023-04-10 16:00:00+00:00

Yes, it’s worth the hype.

Travel + Leisure / Reese Herrington

True story: I haven’t checked a bag in four years. As a travel editor and frequent flier, I’ve had a lot of practice packing lightly and efficiently into carry-ons — no waiting around baggage claim if I can help it! — and I’ve finally got my trips down to a science. My secret is, well, not really a big secret: the Away Bigger Carry-on.

You’ve probably seen this suitcase that Travel + Leisure editors named the “Best Hardside Carry-on Luggage of 2023” all over the Internet (and rolling smoothly around airports all over the world), but I’m here to tell you that it’s 100 percent worth the hype. For trips less than two weeks, I won’t travel with anything else.

Away

To buy: away.com, $295



What makes this bag so special? Well, for starters it’s just about the biggest possible dimension most airlines allow in the overhead bin on airplanes, at 22.7 inches by 14.7 inches by 9.6 inches. I’ve found it to be a perfect fit on a majority of planes (and if not, once I get it on, the flight attendant checks it for free), which means I know I’m getting the most packing space possible, 47.9 liters to be exact. (That’s 20 percent more capacity than the brand’s smaller version, the Carry-on.)

Paired with the Longitude Tote, I’ve wheeled the green Bigger Carry-on all over the world: to Greece for two weeks, to Scandinavia for a two-country luxury trip, to Florida for beach trips, to Egypt for a week when I covered myself head-to-toe in linen — heck, it’s even taken me across Switzerland in the winter. On a multi-city itinerary. Think of the bulky sweaters and fancy après-ski looks!

The true secret of this bag is its interior compression system. On one side, there are two adjustable buckle straps you can tighten to flatten your packed clothes in a bit, and on the other a zippered mesh enclosure that compacts your clothes down. The divider compresses even more, and there’s also a convenient zipper pocket for storing smaller items like a travel jewelry case, belts, toiletries, etc.

Story continues

Away claims it can hold six to nine outfits, and in my experience that’s accurate. Full disclosure: I almost never pack more than two pairs of shoes in a suitcase, and I prefer to stick mostly to basics that can be matched with other items of clothing and dressed up or down with accessories like a belt or jewelry. Even so, on a recent trip to Charleston, I fit eight outfits, including two dresses, two pairs of shoes, a jumpsuit, jeans, a rain jacket, Patagonia puffer jacket, work out clothes, plus a bathing suit I never travel without in addition to my Lululemon belt bag. So, confirmed that it’s pretty much a magical bottomless carry-on.

Travel + Leisure / Reese Herrington

Somehow, though, the Bigger Carry-on still has a little give. I’ve stuffed this bag to the brim, and the zipper has never once broken (even in Montréal when I’ve had to sit on it to get it closed — yes, editors do that sometimes too, okay?)

But roominess is not the only thing I love about this carry-on. I also appreciate that its outer polycarbonate shell is durable enough to withstand any adventure. I’ve seen a scratch and smudge or two on mine in the past four years I’ve had it, but I’m convinced it’s indestructible.

To buy: away.com, $295



Why else do I love this bag? Let me count the ways. First, it glides easily in any direction with its 360-degree spinner wheels. Second, it has a TSA-approved combination lock to keep all my belongings safe and secure. Third, it comes with a water-resistant laundry bag. Fourth, it is undeniably sleek in design and colors (there are seven available). By the way, the pink Petal color is even on rare sale right now.

Away

To buy: away.com, $267 (originally $295)



It’s no wonder this bag has a nearly perfect five-star rating at Away out of 3,300 reviews. One reviewer said the Bigger Carry-on is worth the investment, saying the bag “does everything you would expect at this price point” (and I can attest that with this longevity, it deserves to pass the cost-effectiveness battle you’re having in your head).

Another traveler who brought it on a 10-day trip to Europe called the Bigger Carry-on “perfect” and said it held “five dresses, [a] ball skirt, six pairs of shoes, spare jeans, multiple tees, pool and loungewear, plus all the foundational garments I needed.”

Even better? Away has improved upon the Bigger Carry-on over the years since I got mine back in 2019. There’s now a Bigger Carry-on Flex, which allows for even more space if you can believe it, expanding an extra 2.25 inches. And my personal favorite, which I would buy if I had to choose a new one today, is the Bigger Carry-on with Pocket, which has a genius front pocket for storing away your laptop with easy access at TSA.

A two-week trip in one suitcase isn’t for everyone or every trip, but it can be done. And Away is so confident in this carry-on that they give buyers a 100-day trial period on top of free shipping, which is pretty great if you’re on the fence. So go ahead, pick up your own Away Bigger Carry-on to see what all the fuss is about — this travel editor is confident you’ll be glad you did.

At the time of publishing, the price started at $267.

https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/04/14/opinion/medical-staff-have-heard-this-anti-union-rhetoric-before/,Medical staff have heard this anti-union rhetoric before,"Community doctors’ practices and partnerships have shrunk, but hospital-owned physician organizations like the kind Curry’s hospital uses have grown. These help human resources keep account of their employed doctors but do not help them hold accountable institutions. If I understand senior faculty as spent forces and academic figureheads as impotent totems, then I see no champions and feel no partners. Just sympathizers. Collective bargaining is a natural consequence of a perceived moral threat and professional perversity. Unionization of young doctors is part of a larger generational trend that increasingly values systemic accountability over personal authority.

In his op-ed, “ Unionization at Mass General Brigham puts doctor training at risk ” (Opinion, April 3), Dr. William Curry wrote that the resident was his “only partner” in the operating room, but it’s David and Goliath at the negotiation table when residents and fellows bargain with the Commonwealth’s largest private employer. Once upon a time, the attending, resident, and patient gathered in a room, but the hospital is no longer just the room itself. Rather, “the hospital” is in the room with us — a corporate entity whose “flexibility” can work residents like laborers but tally them as students. Residents are tired of being fleeced, whether in gifted Patagonia or promised Shangri-la by our “only partners.” I’d rather they secured a bathroom break.

As a staff physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, I was disappointed to read the op-ed penned by the chief medical officer of MGH in opposition to the house staff’s unionization drive. The anti-union rhetoric is redolent of that used by large corporations such as Starbucks and Amazon.

Along with Senators Ed Markey and Bernie Sanders, I support their efforts to unionize in order to achieve adequate compensation as well as safe and healthy working conditions.

In 2014, I started my infectious diseases fellowship at Mass General Brigham. Within a few weeks I felt overwhelmed and anxious, and needed a brief medical leave of absence. I was able to return and complete the fellowship, but it was difficult, and I could have received more support from the institution.

Years later, I am no longer employed by MGB, but I fully support the efforts of residents to unionize. I still am a Mass General patient, and I am certain that if the residents were unionized, the quality of patient care and house staff education would improve.

Philip A. Lederer, MD

Jamaica Plain





William Curry’s op-ed opposing unionization for resident physicians at Mass General Brigham essentially says, “Trust me.” Alas, if residents and patients like me had been able to trust MGB all along, there would be no need for a union.

A union for resident physicians won’t solve all of medicine’s problems, but it will at least give young doctors a voice to try to fix the mistakes the older generation has made.

Sue Bass

Belmont





Dr. Curry’s reaction to the current organizing drive by doctors at Mass General is well meaning but lacks a critical understanding of why they want a union. The residents and interns at the Brigham want a direct role in improving the overall care of their patients, since our health care system in the United States is broken. In addition to receiving excellent clinical training, these doctors are fighting for a role in decision-making to improve the health of their patients, not just a specific procedure. These doctors are not forming a union simply for better wages and benefits, they have a much larger agenda.

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed how the challenging working conditions of nurses, doctors, and other front-line health care staff had a direct impact on patient care in troubling ways. These circumstances helped crystallize for many residents and interns, in numerous hospitals in the United States, that increased collective actions are needed by them, and other health care staff, to improve access and quality of care. They view these activities complement — in important ways — their clinical education.

Having a union for doctors doesn’t take away from the clinical training of doctors but provides them opportunities to have a broader impact on the health of patients and our communities.

Analyst's Take on the Market Projection

According to Sachin Singh, Lead Analyst, BIS Research, ""In recent years, there has been an increased emphasis on employing recyclable, reusable, or biodegradable materials, which has given rise to advanced recycling technologies. With the growth of plastic waste, there is an increasing need for advanced recycling. For instance, according to United Nations, the amount of plastic garbage increased dramatically, from 2 million tonnes in 1950 to more than 460 million tonnes in 2021, and it is predicted that this amount will double by the year 2040. This is creating the need for stricter regulations on recycling and influencing the advanced recycling technologies market. Various companies such as Nestlé and PepsiCo have announced to replace all their packaging with recyclable materials by 2025. Therefore, the growing interest of food and beverage and consumer goods companies in employing recyclable materials is likely to supplement the market growth.""

Food and Beverage Packaging to be the Leading End User Segment

Among different end-users, food and beverage packaging is expected to be the largest application during the forecast period 2022-2031. In the case of packaging made of recycled plastics, there is a significant possibility that dangerous substances would contaminate food. However, this is not the case with advanced recycled packaging. In addition, in the EU Plastic Strategy, advanced recycling is acknowledged as having ""a powerful effect"" (EU Plastic Strategy, 2018). Therefore, its demand in the food and beverage packaging sector is increasing.

In August 2022 , Cyclyx International, a subsidiary of Agilyx, announced the opening of a new plastics testing laboratory in Portsmouth, U.S. This strategy enabled the company to enhance its recycle process testing capacity and expand the types of plastic waste range to be recycled with the use of company's recycling technology.

https://www.triplepundit.com/story/2023/greenwashing-retail-misleading-claims/771516,Green or Greenwashed: How Retail Can Fight Misleading Claims,"Greenwashing, where companies make false or misleading claims about a product’s environmental benefits in a bid to appeal to eco-conscious consumers, is plaguing the retail industry. This problem not only leads to a breakdown of consumer trust, but it also threatens the future potential for legitimate retail circularity and diminishes the value of brands with products that are truly sustainable.

Across the board, consumers are gravitating toward sustainability. The sustainable fashion industry, for example, is valued at $6.5 billion and is expected to hit $15 billion by 2030 – indicating how hungry consumers are for eco-conscious brands. Still, a recent KPMG survey found that while 75 percent of millennials are ready to change their buying habits in favor of environmentally-friendly products, only 26 percent actually trust brands’ environmental and sustainable claims. This is a direct consequence of brands using misleading labels, hiding the truth about production processes, or misrepresenting environmental standards and certifications.

Just a few recent cases of greenwashing that have made headlines include claiming products are 100 percent recycled when only pieces of the product are, marketing undergarments as safer alternatives to menstrual cycle products even though they contain harmful chemicals, and appointing a big-name celebrity “sustainability ambassador” with a well-documented, outsized carbon footprint.

Unearthing the root causes of greenwashing

In a rush to capitalize on sustainable trends, many retailers have been more focused on marketing the “right” message than actually walking the talk. No longer willing to take brand statements at face value, consumers and investigative journalists are now taking a more active role in uncovering greenwashing, but the process is harder than it sounds.

Validating marketing claims requires a level of contextually relevant and accurate product information, traceability, and supplier data-sharing that is largely unseen in retail supply chains today. Supply chains are complex, involving multiple suppliers, manufacturers and intermediaries, making it all the more difficult to trace products from origin to final destination. As a result, unscrupulous suppliers, who may not be transparent about their sustainability practices, sometimes slip through the cracks.

Finding that half of the environmental claims used to advertise products in the European Union are misleading or unfounded, the European Commission is preparing to introduce rules to prevent greenwashing. One method involves the use of digital product passports or profiles that contain pertinent information on the product’s material extraction, production and recycling processes, which can then be shared with the entire value chain. Other regulations center around extended producer responsibility, placing the onus on producers for their product’s end-of-life impact on the environment.

As ESG regulations continue to ramp up, companies will need to prioritize product traceability and consumer transparency or face significant reputational, financial, and potentially regulatory damages.

How technology can help consumer transparency flourish

With EPR (extended producer responsibility) and DPP (digital product passport) regulations in the pipeline, in addition to growing regulatory pressure to disclose or ban products that cause deforestation, building a product “profile” early in its lifecycle sets a critical foundation for persistent identification.

Once that digital passport has been established to underpin transparency and traceability, data carrier technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID) and 2D barcodes, like a QR code, can be used in accordance with industry standards to take these regulatory initiatives a step further.

With their ability to convey and link to a broad range of data, RFID tags and 2D barcodes can be scanned at various points in the supply chain to provide real-time information to trading partners about a product’s origin, conditions during transport and supplier sustainability practices, including produced waste and the overall environmental impact of a product. This information can even be shared with consumers through mobile phone scans.

With an initiative called Sunrise 2027, facilitated by standards body GS1 US, the retail industry is aiming to achieve widespread acceptance of 2D barcodes at point of sale within the next four years. Some of world’s most iconic fashion brands including Burberry, Mulberry, Giorgio Armani and Stella McCartney have already begun adding QR codes to labels for better shopper engagement. By scanning the codes with their smartphones, consumers can learn how the product was made, where the materials came from, and whether or not it was sustainably created. They can also receive important care and repair information to extend the item’s life.

Patagonia is another one of the many forward-thinking brands already using this type of 2D barcode. Ninety-four percent of Patagonia’s product line is made from recycled materials. In lieu of sharing product information, care directions and community initiatives on hang tags, the company has added QR codes to its packaging that web-enables access to all of this rich data. This gives Patagonia customers a more personalized and localized experience, while reducing the amount of single-use tags. The change has enhanced the company's consumer engagement and allowed it to collect more data across all points of sale, better identify instances of counterfeiting, and reduce environmental impact.

Paving the road to circularity

Improved data quality, product traceability, and supply chain transparency are critical stepping stones on the path to circularity. In a truly circular economy, retailers will be able to redesign, reuse, repair, and recycle products instead of relying on virgin materials, thereby reducing waste and ensuring the continuity of finite resources.

If we can more accurately validate the claims made by retailers, we’ll have a better understanding of how far the industry has come with circularity and how much further we have to go. Businesses are taking critical steps, exploring ways to make recycling easier for consumers and reducing the amount of products that end up in our landfills. However, truly advancing sustainability depends on upholding the standards for data quality, traceability, and transparency that enable us to hold every supplier and retailer accountable for greenwashing.

https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2023/apr/14/off-the-grid-van-life-might-be-all-its-made-up-to-/,Off the Grid: Van life might be all it’s made up to be,"By Ammi Midstokke For The Spokesman-Review

For years now, we’ve seen a growing number of these tricked-out vans taking over the roads, campgrounds, Walmart parking lots and state land oases in a kind of quiet revolution of mobility. A migration of millennials, perhaps, without the impetus of the Dust Bowl, embracing their values of freedom and flexibility, bagging peaks by day and writing code by night.

They even sit a little higher than the rest of us on the road, looking down on our commute, no doubt, while they sip cold brew or mushroom coffee. Even their exhaust smells like … possibilities.

Van life, and all its associated hashtags, is not limited to those who have shunned house life (a much less popular influencer trend). There’s a growing faction of people that has tasted the promise and has both van and home. Perhaps those people have, at last, arrived, and can still depart if the luxury of a full bathroom loses its luster or the call of the van-camping expedition becomes irresistible.

Considering my clear prejudice, it was a wonder that I recently found myself careening down the highway in a customized Ram ProMaster, headed for the coast, and unwittingly, a change of heart.

Until now (known as the Raising Teens era), I have considered two forms of vacation accommodation acceptable: a tent and a sleeping pad or an overpriced hotel with obscene amounts of pillows. A camper van seemed to land squarely in the middle of “soft and uncommitted.” Here’s the thing, though: It’s hard to convince my kid to camp in the rain, and I don’t want to share a five-star bed with a lanky-limbed adolescent.

Some weeks previously, I happened across Michael Gustafson of Spokane Valley’s GustoVans at Spokane’s Great Outdoor Expo. Parked on the floor was a converted van with all the amenities, but it was the floral bedspread and excessive pillows that caught my eye.

“Take a look inside,” said Cat Macpherson (competent expo sidekick and van convert), waving me in with a friendly smile as I strolled by. Trapped by an invisible tractor beam of curiosity and the mention of heated flooring, I knew if there were chocolates on the pillow, I was a goner.

“Oh, I’ve been wanting to try one of these,” I lied out of politeness.

My big brother owns the same van, only with more boy stuff. I’m pretty sure it’s why he’s still single but somehow heralded by his fellow climbing buddies. And though I’m married, I could easily mistake a van for an escape pod, particularly if it had down comforters.

Peering at the walnut cabinets and failing to hide my awe, one thing led to another and suddenly Gustafson had offered me a van for a spring break trip. Like a peaceful missionary, he seemed to have a calm confidence that the inevitable truth would be revealed to anyone who had a chance behind the wheel.

Macpherson pointed out that it even had a toilet, but there is a level of intimacy I hope to never achieve with my family. Though the idea of a morning constitutional while making coffee while sitting at a breakfast nook while executing a Zoom conference does seem efficient in the very least. Maybe the millennials are onto something. I accepted their offer, then said a silent prayer to the backcountry camping gods so they would not spite me for my traitorous acts.

Now, my kid and I were blasting an audiobook (“Mortal Engines,” 44 hours of roadie entertainment) on the interstate with an uncharacteristic amount of fun in the cabinets. We brought water color painting kits, knitting projects, one guitar, one banjo, sketch books, two pounds of colored pencils and markers, iPads and several heavy novels, including at least one hardback.

We’re used to cutting our toothbrushes down and bringing only the half of the paperback we’re still reading, then burning it along the way. I wasn’t sure we’d fit in with van life hooligans, their powdered super greens and solar-powered work stations, though we do own enough Patagonia clothing to look the part. To my surprise, we all have something in common beyond our love of Smartwool: The desire to go places and see things. And maybe to not be totally miserable while doing it.

What renting a van is not about: a cheap vacation. Sure, you can bring your food and slap together a salami sandwich while you are pumping gas, but you’re basically a hotel room in a rental car. That’s kind of the point. Would you like your hotel room to be among the towering redwoods of the coast? Or at the edge of sand dunes? Perhaps you’d like to cruise your room through Hell’s Canyon or wake up to the sound of whitewater rapids tumbling by?

It was 40 degrees and pouring rain nearly every day of our trip. Once, it crept up to a balmy 45, and we immediately staged a spontaneous jam session underneath our extendable awning on what we labeled “the front porch.” I recalled being stuck in a tent with a double deck of Uno for days on end with a much smaller version of my offspring in the very same campground. That version was thankfully forgetful and forgiving. This one would never vacation with me again in the same circumstances. In a world where impressing a teen is a statistical anomaly, the van was a hit.

We rendezvoused in the high desert with my brother and my cousin, three vans stuffed with kids and kid things. It was as if the bedding section had vomited in one and the alpine shop in another. Our van was, of course, the sophisticate of them all, what with our art supplies and literature and musical instruments. We were very proud.

My brother has a 6-year-old. Trix cereal was strewn about, socks, smelly shoes, climbing gear, skis, an ax throwing set, cocktail fixings, 10 pounds of grass-fed beef, ice. My cousin brought his whole family: one infant, one child, one partner, one Rottweiler, a full-size Backgammon board. Their van was like the utility closet of a preschool with a breast pump for good measure. Clearly, I had been typecasting van owners. They come in all shapes, sizes, colors, pronouns, ages and varying affinity for organic produce.

They are the moving targets of what is seemingly appealing – a care-free, unscheduled, independent experience, whether a temporary or more permanent housing solution. Having apparently driven right out of The Who song “Goin’ Mobile,” the Van-ites have an autonomy that is, in the very least, alluring.

I don’t care about pollution

I’m an air-conditioned gypsy

That’s my solution

Watch the police and the tax man miss me

It would have been weird if nothing had gone wrong, of course. So when the heater started coughing and sputtering, I was almost relieved. I was getting spoiled by “camping” in 65 degrees.

Oddly, this is what made me want to buy my own van. I called Gustafson (at 10, on a Saturday night), who sent me into the bowels of the beast and taught me how to log into the furnace software from my phone to locate the problem. As an off-grid aficionado of self-sustaining systems, the simplicity of digging into this one for a solution had me chirping at it like Scotty from “Star Trek.” It’s the same, loving relationship I had with my propane generator for years.

Eight days later, we returned from our maiden voyage and reluctantly returned the keys. I had slept well (barring one night of a crowing rooster), read several books, written letters, learned a new banjo tune, drank enough coffee to burst the heart of a racing horse, enjoyed a sit-down meal with my kid each day (not just chili out of a can), and had one of the easiest, most relaxing adventures I can recall. Best of all, my kid and I had been stalwart collaborators and navigators the entire trip, and dare I say, delightful companions.

A thousand miles on the road has not been known for its familial bonding powers since the days of our parents tossing a mattress and a loaf of Wonder Bread sandwiches in the back of the station wagon. But maybe the freedom and fun of those adventures has been restored, along with safety and the convenience of a microwave.

Which, of course, in my van, will be replaced with an espresso machine.

A largely forgotten chapter of a little-remembered war between England and Spain provides the setting for this gripping study of human nature in extremis. Wager, a British frigate, crashed onto rocks off the coast of Patagonia while pursuing the enemy into the Pacific in 1741. The seas in that remote part of the world are infamous. “Below forty degrees latitude, there is no law,” went a sailors’ adage. “Below fifty degrees, there is no God.”

A non-fiction account of the chase, the wreck and what followed might have been told as a typical maritime adventure. Those who love yarns involving cannon fire, sea-chests, plum duff and mainmasts will find “The Wager” riveting, as will those less intrigued by the age of sail. In the hands of David Grann, the story transcends its naval setting. The author, whose previous bestsellers include “The Lost City of Z” and “The White Darkness”, is a master of exciting tales in far-flung places. He has produced a volume so dramatic and engrossing that it may surpass his previous books.

The tale revolves around three complex figures. Wager’s captain, David Cheap, began to lose sway over the men as soon as the ship foundered. The crew became castaways on a small island in the Golfo de Penas (“Gulf of Pain”). Just over half the original complement of 250 had survived outbreaks of typhus and scurvy onboard. Aloof and slow to adapt, Cheap derived his authority from the chain of command rather than natural charisma. But he was also physically brave and loyal to the mission, at one point single-handedly facing down a band of armed mutineers without a weapon of his own.

By contrast, John Bulkeley “emerged as a leader on his own merits”. A working seaman whose job, as gunner, was to oversee the ship’s cannon, he started foraging food, constructing shelter and bartering supplies from the moment his feet touched land. Others began looking to him for answers. Mr Grann writes that little is known about Bulkeley except that he was a devout Christian who swung hard in a fight. Yet he was no brute: he kept a detailed journal of Wager’s travails, peppered with verse.",[],2023-04-13 00:00:00

https://time.com/6271264/how-we-chose-time100-2023/,How We Chose the 2023 TIME100,"One of the most inspiring initiatives for us at TIME over the past few years has been convening TIME100 honorees from around the globe. What began nearly two decades ago as an annual list of the world’s most influential people has become a community of leaders from across fields, who join together in venues from Singapore and New York City to Dubai and Los Angeles, to spotlight solutions toward a better future. At this year’s first gathering of TIME100s, in Davos, Switzerland, the overarching theme was the confluence of interconnected challenges, from climate and public health to democracy and equality.

That is also the central theme running through the 2023 TIME100 list—starting with the most existential of challenges: climate change. This year’s list features a record 16 people defending the environment, including the new leaders of Australia, Colombia, and Brazil, all recently elected on a wave of pro-climate sentiment. Also counted among that group are scientists like Andrea Kritcher, whose experiments brought controlled fusion power closer to reality than ever before; Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard, who donated his company to the fight; and environmental-justice advocate Catherine Coleman Flowers.

We also include cultural titans like Angela Bassett, whom singer Tina Turner praises for always having “strength, determination, and big, big dreams,” and pioneers like Sam Altman, whose company released the generative artificial intelligence platform ChatGPT, advancing what Airbnb founder Brian Chesky calls in this issue “the most powerful tool ever created.” Recognized here too are Ozlem Tureci and Ugur Sahin, mRNA-vaccine trailblazers who led the way on COVID-19 jabs and are now turning to cancer vaccines with exciting results. And we may all someday owe a debt to physicist Edward Reynolds, who oversaw a successful mission to collide a small spacecraft with an asteroid in order to knock the latter off course. A passionate group of activists are also on this list, including Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, whose work continues to gain resonance as gun violence remains a tragically daily threat in America’s communities.

Central to confronting the world’s shared challenges is the pursuit of truth, an endeavor increasingly under attack. We recognize three journalists who have taken great risks in the course of that duty. Elaheh Mohammadi and Niloofar Hamedi, courageous Iranian reporters, have been jailed over their crucial coverage of the protests against the regime. And the work of Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter facing bogus espionage charges for reporting on Russia, has galvanized supporters of press freedom around the world. We celebrate Evan’s commitment to our profession and join in calling for his immediate release.

In February 2019, Kim Kardashian took to Twitter to express her disapproval for an online fashion company that is known to sell knockoff designer clothing. She complained that she had worn a one-of-a-kind dress, and in less than 24 hours a website had stolen her look and sold it online. The internet felt the shock waves of a fashionista dismayed. While her issue with this process is rooted in designer disrespect, it raises alarming questions: Exactly how do these fashion companies do it so fast, and why is their product so affordable?

If you’re like me, it’s possible some of your best outfits have come from mall stores like H&M, Forever 21, Zara, UNIQLO and so on. If you’re even a little like me, it’s likely you prefer to spend less money shopping for trendy clothes. You can find many fully online stores selling articles of clothing for as little as a few cents. What is going on, and why do my orders take months to arrive on my doorstep? Allow me to introduce you to one of the world’s biggest problems today: fast fashion.

Consumers of these companies may notice that the quality of product is rather poor, inviting a one-wear approach. Fast fashion companies thrive off of cheap textile production on a mass scale, mostly outsourced from China and India. These inexpensive materials include mostly synthetic polyester (the least expensive textile to produce), cotton, elastane, viscose and nylon. Pushing trendy products utilizing a quick output model comes at a great ethical cost. Not only is the quality and re-wearability of clothing sacrificed, but so is public health.

Textile production is one of the most polluting industries in the world, responsible for emitting nearly 1.2 billion tons of CO2 (carbon dioxide, a killer greenhouse gas) per year, contributing to global warming, climate change and profound natural disasters. Humans have suffered extreme weather events as a direct result of our gaseous transgressions, such as wildfires, large tropical storms, severe drought and record-high heat.

If that doesn’t quite paint the picture, know that every second, one garbage-truck full of clothing materials is dumped into landfills or burned. Burning synthetic material is toxic for our environment and reduces breathable air quality, causing a multitude of health issues in affected populations. You may have heard that the trash contents of landfills frequently make their way into our oceans, causing harm to our marine life. Fast fashion materials take exponentially longer to break down, plaguing our natural environment with toxins and adding to human-made disasters like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

Many of us have been hearing these warnings from environmentalists for years. While we may be desensitized to what occurs on our turf, take into consideration the hands that touch your clothes before they are shipped across the world. Garment workers often face the poorest working conditions, working for mere cents per hour to produce our beloved Kardashian duplicates. Textiles are constructed by the hands of underpaid women and children who suffer in diseased factory conditions and poor living situations. This method of production relies on consumers like you and I who return for another one-time-wear outfit. Again, and again and again.

While all of this information may seem overwhelming, there is something valuable gained by becoming aware of this crisis. You have just become aware of your power. These companies rely on you and I, and without us, they collapse. It is entirely possible to break the cycle of clothing waste with your participation. In the long run, you will save money investing in an ethically produced, higher quality garment that you can add to a rotatable closet and feel good knowing your product has never seen a sweatshop.

Another great shopping alternative is hitting the thrift store. I have scouted some of my favorite high-fashion clothes at secondhand shops. I personally feel a higher rush of dopamine when I find a marked-down Patagonia in great condition than paying full price in stores or online. I invite you to shop for your next outfit at your local thrift store; you may be surprised by what you find. If you’re not ready to shop secondhand but are starting to second-guess where you spend your money, a Google search can help you find out what companies push ethical product.

Kim Kardashian is definitely onto something putting the spotlight on trendy, 24-hour turnaround sites. Let us be the generation that purges itself of this wasteful structure that has a grip on the working class — everywhere. You are more powerful than you think.

https://phys.org/news/2023-04-corporate-social-responsibility-family-businesses.html,Corporate social responsibility: Why family businesses get more bang for their buck than non-family firms,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

While family owners can sometimes be bad for business, they can also be beneficial in many ways. Credit: Shutterstock

When it comes to turning corporate social responsibility (CSR) into profit, research shows family businesses have the advantage. CSR is a form of self-regulation where businesses make concerted efforts to be socially and ethically accountable to themselves, their stakeholders and the public.

In our recent study on S&P 500 firms' CSR strategies, we found that family businesses get more bang for their buck. While family owners can sometimes be bad for business—the desire for control can result in family-owned businesses under-investing in things like innovation and diversification—they can also be beneficial.

Family owners tend to focus on the long term because, unlike CEOs in non-family firms, they want their firm to benefit their children and grandchildren.

Because family owners think in terms of generations, they invest more in enhancing their company's reputation and building deeper connections with employees, suppliers and communities.

Family firms are also able to dedicate the time needed for high quality CSR strategies, unlike non-family firms that might neglect CSR because of short-tenured leadership and concerns about quarterly earnings.

Symbolic CSR distracts from problems

There are two types of CSR strategies: symbolic and substantive. Symbolic CSR strategies are low-cost actions designed to garner media attention without solving underlying problems. They are reactive, self-serving and distract from current problems.

An extreme and tragic—but powerful—example of symbolic CSR comes from a study on a Malaysian forestry firm's operations in Guyana. The researchers found that the company's Forest Stewardship Council certification diverted attention away from the systemic rape of local women by employees of the company. It took years for global environmental groups and agencies to see through the company's CSR deception and believe the accusations.

While the initial positive effect of symbolic CSR can distract from a company's wrongdoings, the impact usually wears off once stakeholders see through its facade. This is what happened during BP's massive Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.

Initially, stakeholders were impressed with BP's reaction to the crisis, but once they realized the company had cut back on environmental protections—including equipment meant to prevent oil spills—they quickly withdrew their support.

Substantive CSR solves problems

Substantive CSR, in contrast to symbolic CSR, is long term and actually addresses pressing societal problems. It is backed by meaningful investment and implementation. Organizations engaged in substantive CSR will change processes, suppliers and their entire value chains.

Outdoor clothing company Patagonia is an example of an organization pursuing substantive CSR. On its website, Patagonia discusses climate change and the global rise of CO 2 emissions. Such proclamations might seem symbolic, but Patagonia addresses environmental issues substantively and has committed to only using renewable energy across all its facilities by 2025.

Substantive CSR can detract from financial performance in the short term because it takes time and money to implement, but it can eventually lift the firm's reputation and excite stakeholders about its products and services. A favorable reputation, in turn, improves customer loyalty, sales and profits.

CSR has long-term benefits

Our research found that CSR strategies at family-owned businesses significantly improved firm performance. This benefit wasn't felt immediately, but in the third year after the initial CSR investment. Positive benefits endured throughout the fourth and fifth years of the strategies being implemented.

Our analysis found that a 20 percent increase in substantive CSR improved the annual return on assets (a financial ratio that measures a company's profitability in relation to its assets) to 5.78 percent from 4.30 percent within three years. This change equalled a 34 percent return on assets increase.

When it came to stock market performance (the annual change in the price of the company's shares on the stock market), the increase was 15.5 percent.

Non-family firms, on average, did not benefit financially from substantive CSR. Their inability to sustain investments across CEOs and time might have reduced stakeholders' enthusiasm in the company's CSR efforts.

Non-family firms must work harder to convince stakeholders their intentions are real and sustainable before they are able to reap above-average financial benefits from substantive CSR.

CSR has short-term benefits

Family-owned businesses also benefited more than non-family firms when it came to using symbolic CSR strategies. We found that symbolic CSR improved firm performance immediately for family firms.

A 20 percent increase in symbolic CSR increased their average return on assets within one year to 5.74 percent from 4.30 percent—an overall increase of 33 percent. For stock market performance, the increase in the price of the company's shares was 5.1 percent.

Their favorable reputations and relationships with customers, suppliers and the local community gave family-owned firms a buffer if things went wrong.

In the event of a scandal—or a symbolic CSR strategy being exposed as surface-level and insufficient—stakeholders were more likely to trust family owners to address underlying issues and convert their symbolic claims into substantive actions.

Similar investments in symbolic CSR among non-family firms helped them keep up with peers, but not get ahead. Stakeholders were simply more skeptical of non-family firms' symbolic CSR activities.

Though the average non-family firm may not see significant gains from CSR investments, some do. By building credibility around long-term CSR commitments, more businesses could overcome stakeholders' skepticism and gain more bang for their CSR buck.

Profitable in more than one way

Research shows that the older generations of family business owners often under-invested in CSR. This has the potential to lead to considerable conflict with younger generations because for many millennials and Gen Zs, the environment, community and society can matter as much—or more—than profit.

Our research shows that investing in CSR can be about reaping financial gain while also making societal contributions. Aligning people, the planet and profits is not only worthwhile and laudable—it might also help the next generation identify more strongly with the family business and motivate them to become responsible owners for another generation.

Forwarders have warned that too much oxygen in the sustainability debate is being “sucked up by brand management” and kowtowing to big shippers without actioning real change.

Several forwarder sources told The Loadstar the majority of their customers had not shown any “real demand” for sustainable services when there was not a performative element to it.

“Some exceptionally ESG-type companies that make it part of their marketing to be clean – think Patagonia – are demanding greener supply chains,” one forwarder said.

“However, the average importer has zero concern in this space. I think it will only come onto the radar of these forwarders and shippers if (or when) countries start implementing some sort of carbon border adjustment mechanism.

“If an importer sees importing costs increase substantially as a result of this, they will certainly become interested in lower-emission cargo movement.”

But in general, the perception from SME forwarders was that shippers tended not to “really care” about emissions in their supply chains where there was a disconnect between them and the end customer. While one acknowledged sustainability was “becoming more important” others agreed it was less to do with environmental concern and more an exercise in “brand management”.

A forwarder operating in South America told The Loadstar: “My customers show little to no interest in sustainability yet, and in the cases where we have offered it as a differential, the first question has always been about costs and the second about longer service times.”

Forwarders have said that such is the disconnect between the news and social media coverage of sustainability drives and the reality that they are seeing, that it is hard to get beyond a belief that “greenwashing” drives discussion but generates very little actionable change.

In the European Union, at least, action appears to be being taken to tackle a rise in vague and misleading claims of green practices.

Secretary general of the European Shippers Council Godfried Smit said: “Greenwashing is a subject that the EU-legislator has acted upon, and the implications of companies being blacklisted are simply too big to deal with. Many companies realise this and are already taking measures to prepare for this legislation.”

Close to 75% of products on the market make green claims about their supply chains, but the EU said over half of these were “vague, misleading or unfounded”, with close to 50% of 230 ‘eco labels’ available having weak or no verification procedures. Under the new rules, there will be minimum requirements for companies claiming green practices and eco labels.

Mr Smit told The Loadstar he thought there was scope for forwarders to take a more assertive role in the green movement, suggesting they simply limited their transport offerings to the most sustainable mode.",['Alex Whiteman'],2023-04-12 11:57:27+00:00
https://abc7.com/ventura-cybersecurity-grit-middle-school-girls/13128722/,GRIT provides middle school girls with opportunity to get involved in male-heavy cybersecurity field,"The cybersecurity job market is expected to grow 3.5 million jobs this year, but the available workforce isn't keeping pace. One middle school program is hoping to fill the gap by giving girls an added opportunity in the field.

VENTURA, Calif. (KABC) -- Organizations around the world are increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats. While the number of people working in cybersecurity is at record levels, there's a need for more, especially women. But where will they be found? Some might say middle school.

The need for cybersecurity professionals is expected to grow by almost 3.5 million jobs this year when compared to 2021 numbers, but the available workforce isn't keeping pace.

Many in the industry say the gap is largely because of a lack of interest from young people entering the cybersecurity job market, particularly women who only account for 25% of the jobs.

""There is an underserved community of women engineers in technology,"" said Scott Reed, a senior account executive at ePlus Technology.

DeAnza Academy of Technology and the Arts in Ventura now has GRIT: Girls Re-Imagining Tomorrow. Founded on the East coast in 2017 by ePlus Technology, GRIT shows middle school girls the possibilities available to them with a career in technology.

Middle school is an important age to start because a recent survey of women who work in the field showed 78% developed an interest in science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, in middle or high school.

""Being able to work with Patagonia, ePlus and other community partners has provided all our girls a networking system to figure out for themselves, 'Hey, I can realize this dream that I have,' and because of what we do here at the school, it really makes the learning relevant. It brings the learning to life,"" said Carlos Cohen, the principal of DeAnza Academy of Technology and the Arts.

The program has grown to seven schools across the nation, introducing girls to online safety, public speaking and business etiquette, while inspiring curiosity in various areas of STEM through field trips similar to a trip to NOAA in Oxnard where other young women explained their path to success to the girls from DATA.

""A bunch of the ladies we have met so far are engineers who work on boats and solve problems and that is something I might want to do in the future and seeing how they do it and what resources they use really helped me,"" said GRIT participant Gwen Anderson.

""When I think of jobs, I think like, firefighters or like, police or doctors. But, now I can see there's people who help the environment or people who make software or even like, make clothes,"" said Flor Arroyo, who is also a participant in GRIT.

GRIT was so popular in year one, there was a wait list to get involved for year two. So the DATA team created a GRIT club that includes any girls who want to get involved.

Reed explained what he hopes GRIT can accomplish over time.

""I want them to dream and I want them to imagine, and if we arm them with the confidence and the mentorship and a lot of the core curriculum that we're doing, they can say, 'I can see myself doing this,' and I think it provides a lot of hope and encouragement about the future,"" said Reed.",[],2023-04-14 23:24:55+00:00

Peck Center on April 22.

A press release from the Wyoming Outdoor Council, who produced the film along with the Indigenous Land Alliance of Wyoming and Topographic Media, invites the public to the premiere, a panel discussion and a reception afterwards that will have food, drinks and music.

The Red Desert is widely regarded as an important area in the state, namely for its recreational opportunities, vast amounts of wildlife and plant species and attractiveness due to its natural resources, like coal, oil and natural gas. One of the aims of the documentary, according to the council, is to “safeguard the Red Desert for future generations.”

It’s also home to the Run the Red race, a trail race that takes runners through the desert on a half marathon, 50K and 100K course in an effort to show people its beauty and encourage conservation.

The film, which is named “Last of the Wild: A Red Desert Story” centers on the “iconic landscape” of the desert with a runtime of 25 minutes, the press release states.

“Preserving the land and the wildlife it supports is not just a responsibility, it’s an honor. ‘Last of the Wild’ reminds us of the cultural and historic significance of the Red Desert and the need to protect it as a national treasure,” said Big Wind Carpenter, the Wyoming Outdoor Council’s tribal engagement coordinator and member of the Northern Arapaho tribe.

To Indigenous peoples, especially the Eastern Shoshone people, the Red Desert is very important to them — a place they could go hunting, get medicines and travel for trade. Nearby South Pass City, before it was a gold rush destination, was home for the Eastern Shoshone people. But they were excluded from managing their lands for 150 years, previous Star-Tribune reporting states.

This documentary is not the first time that the Red Desert has found itself a big-screen star. In 2020, Patagonia made a nine-minute documentary about Run the Red called “Unfenced.” It can be viewed on the brand’s website.

In addition to the Riverton premiere, the film will also be showing in several Wyoming towns and cities:

Laramie at the Gryphon Theatre from 6:30-7:30 p.m. on April 27;

Rock Springs at the Broadway Theater from 6:30-7:30 p.m. on April 28;

Pinedale at the Sublette County Library (Lovett Room) from 6:30-7:30 p.m. on May 11;

and at Lander at the Lander Valley High School Auditorium from 6:30-7:30 p.m. on May 19.

The council’s website promises more screenings across the state in October and November.

The film was directed by Lander filmmaker Kirk Rasmussen.","['Jordan Smith Jordan.Smith Trib.Com', 'Jordan Smith', 'Nic Wegner']",

""When planning for this new Antarctic season, we took into consideration the barriers currently facing global travelers,"" said Thomas Lennartz, Vice-president of Sales and Client Experience. ""In addition to offering 25% off select Antarctic voyages—with an extra 10% off when paying in full at time of booking—we're introducing a $1,000 USD flight credit off the top of their trip costs on all departures. We're topping that off with a US $250 shipboard credit (on all departures) which guests can use at their discretion.""

The financial incentives, combined with the one-of-a-kind off-ship experiences exclusive to Quark Expeditions, bode well for a very successful Antarctic 2024.25 season.

https://www.aspentimes.com/news/5point-film-festival-returns-with-expanded-community-events/,5Point Film Festival returns with expanded community events,"5Point head of programming Charlie Turnbull has worked to evolve the festival into a cultural and community event.

Adrenaline junkies, it’s time to get stoked for the 16th annual 5Point Film Festival returning to Carbondale Wednesday, April 19, through Sunday, April 23.

“From a programming perspective, the bar is so high, and adventure filmmakers are producing really high-quality projects,” said head of programming Charlie Turnbull. “Ever since ‘Free Solo’ won the Oscar, the genre has become very in vogue. It’s also spurred a lot of our filmmakers to tell more human-interest stories that have a backdrop of adventure and the outdoors.”

The festival will present 40 films, including 15 world premieres and 10 Colorado premieres.

Making its regional debut is the latest film from Oscar-winning filmmakers Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, “Wild Life,” which follows conservationist Kris Tompkins on a decades-spanning love story.

After meeting her husband, outdoorsman, and entrepreneur Doug Tomkins, she and he left behind successful careers in the brands they helped pioneer — Patagonia, The North Face, and Esprit — to create national parks throughout Chile and Argentina via their non-profit Tompkins Conservation. The film follows the highs and lows of those efforts and will screen on Saturday, April 15, at 1 p.m.





“Jimmy Chin and Chai Vasarhelyi’s new feature film about Kris Tompkins is great. It’s just a really beautiful love story slash conservation story that will blow audiences away,” said Turnbull.

Another film making its Colorado premiere is pertinent to what’s happening with the re-introduction of wolves into Colorado: “Range Rider.”

The film introduces us to Daniel Curry, a range rider whose job is to patrol wild areas on horseback, creating a buffer between wolves and cattle herds that graze on public lands. The film focuses on Washington State and the complicated issues that arise in rural ranching areas with re-introduction and asks if co-existence between ranchers and wolves is possible. The film is directed by Colin Arisman, with cinematography by Carbondale local Oliver Sutro.

“I’m really excited about the Colorado premiere of ‘Range Rider.’ ACES is supporting that screening, and I know it’s super topical here at the moment,” said Turnbull.

“Range Rider” takes on the issues and conflicts between ranchers and wolves in Washington State.

With about 400 submissions from filmmakers from the United States, Canada, and Europe, Turnbull said, it was tough to narrow it down to only 40 films. He said the key to programming the festival is to keep the audience “on their toes” with a mix of hardcore adventure, personal storytelling, and some films that are just light and funny.

Audiences will also find a mix of outdoor sports from cycling, climbing, and skiing to paddling, running, and more.

5Point has added several free events throughout the five days, including a special screening of “Resistance Climbing,” a film about a group of climbers in conflict-torn Palestine.

According to Turnbull, beyond the film programming, 5Point is expanding its footprint throughout the week with new cultural offerings for attendees and the community.

For the first time, it will offer a curated music lineup that complements the nightly film programs, featuring Denver rock band iZCALLi, Brothers of Brass, and a one-night-only reunion performance of local yacht rock band The Davenports. All the musical performances are free.

The festival also will present live comedy night as part of the festival at the Black Nugget, featuring comedians Salma Zaky, Gabby Gutierrez-Reed, and Sammy Anzer, hosted by Denver comedian Eeland Stribling.

Another new addition, in partnership with Independence Run and Hike and ValleyOrtho, is the first 5K on Saturday, April 22, at 9-10 a.m. The race starts and ends at Independence Run and Hike, $25 per entry, free for VIP pass holders.

“We wanted to be a bit ambitious and to try and grow it into something that was more than just films, particularly with those free events,” Turnbull said. “We see it as a good way to cultivate community around this event and to build it into a festival where there really is something for everyone. Obviously, the films will always be our core kind of draw and programming component, but it’s really cool to have music and comedy and especially the 5k Saturday kind of opportunity for the community to come and enjoy something for free mingle with the filmmakers.”

For him, programming the festival and being part of the community is a dream come true. An Australian, he said he hadn’t heard of 5Points until 2018, when he came to the festival supporting his film “Bikes of Wrath,” which follows five Aussie friends as they attempt to cycle from Oklahoma to California in honor of John Steinbeck’s classic novel “The Grapes of Wrath,” following the same route as American farmers during the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s.

He was so impressed by the experience and the community of Carbondale that when the opportunity came up in 2020 to program the festival, he jumped at the chance.

“It’s such a special and unique festival because everything and everyone is in one place,” he said. “There’s no competing screenings in different locations, which a lot of film festivals have. There are 800 people that come together, and the energy inside the rec center is really unique and hard to beat. It’s an intoxicating experience that (founder) Julie Kennedy created long before we did, but we hope we’ve still got it.”

NEW YORK, April 13, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Validity Finance, one of the largest private commercial litigation funders in the United States, today announced that it has been awarded Certified B Corporation™ (B Corp) status. This recognition acknowledges Validity's accountability to its stakeholders, including employees, investors, clients, and the communities in which it operates. Since its founding, Validity has been a purpose-driven organization focused on funding meritorious litigation as a corrective measure for an unbalanced legal system, and its new B Corp status reflects this commitment.

Validity's B Corp certification, bestowed by the nonprofit B Lab, is an acknowledgement that the company is meeting high standards of verified performance, accountability, and transparency on factors ranging from environmental sustainability to employee benefits and corporate governance. Validity is the first U.S. commercial litigation funder to achieve B Corp status, a significant milestone in the maturation of the litigation finance sector, joining such prominent companies as Patagonia, Bomba, and Warby Parker.

""The B Corp evaluation process offered an excellent framework for Validity to review and improve our policies and practices, and to affirm our commitment to making a meaningful impact for our clients and the legal community,"" said Ralph Sutton, Validity's Founder & CEO. ""Since our founding five years ago, we have been guided by a promise to not only help promote fairness in the legal system, but also to adhere to the strictest ethical standards in our business operations.""

There are currently only 6,000 Certified B Corporations across more than 80 countries and 150 industries. To become a Certified B Corporation, companies must undergo a comprehensive, multi-year assessment of the impact of their operations and business models on their workers, customers, communities, and environment, and must receive a minimum verified score on the B Impact Assessment. Certified B Corps are legally required to consider the impact of their decisions on all stakeholders.

""At a time when the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is attempting to leverage misinformation to unfairly stigmatize the litigation funding sector and to preserve the unfair advantage traditionally afforded deep-pocketed defendants in commercial litigation, we are proud to spotlight our corporate purpose,"" said Julia Gewolb, Validity's Chief Risk Officer.

Validity approaches every funding opportunity with a focus on trust, fairness, and transparency, enabling the company to build and sustain long-term client relationships by empowering clients with the resources they need to pursue and resolve meritorious litigation fairly and equitably. With decades of combined experience in funding, the Validity team of trial-tested attorneys has invested more than $400 million since 2018 across more than 70 matters.

""As commercial litigation funding expands in the U.S., it's important to engage and educate people about the industry's dedication to a more equitable legal system,"" said Roman M. Silberfeld, National Trial Chair at Robins Kaplan. ""I commend Ralph and Validity for being so forward-thinking and taking this significant step to solidify their commitment to responsible business practices.""

About Validity Finance

Validity is a leading commercial litigation finance company dedicated to fair and transparent funding practices that build trust. The first funder to become a certified B Corp, Validity's mission is to make a meaningful difference in the legal system by helping clients bring good cases to trial with top counsel, while managing legal spend and risk.

https://www.10best.com/interests/outdoor-adventures/best-sights-chilean-patagonia-carretera-austral/,Chile's stunning Carretera Austral: How to plan the most epic Patagonian road trip,"Photo courtesy of Dave Stamboulis Drive through wild Chilean Patagonia A journey down Chilean Patagonia's Carretera Austral (""Southern Highway"" in English) is considered one of the world's most epic road trips. Spanning over 770 miles, this mostly dirt and gravel road passes through the heart of Chilean Patagonia and features extraordinary landscapes with glaciers, volcanoes, hot springs and lakes. Along the way, visitors will see abundant wildlife, waterfalls, small towns, colorful characters – and an amazing 17 national parks. A trip here might be the most memorable and scenic road trip you'll ever take. Here are the best places to stop and explore along Chilean Patagonia's Carretera Austral: Advertisement

Photo courtesy of Dave Stamboulis Explore the Casa Piedra campsite in Patagonia National Park Patagonia National Park is a vast area of 640,000 acres that was once overgrazed ranch land. It was purchased by former North Face CEO Doug Tompkins and his wife, Kris, who spearheaded the restoration of the grasslands and forests. Once the trees, plants and many species of wildlife returned, the couple donated the land to the Chilean government. (Overall, they restored over 2 million acres in Chile and Argentina.) All of this land was turned into Ruta del Parques (Route of Parks), comprising 17 national parks, of which Parque Patagonia might be the crown jewel.

Photo courtesy of Dave Stamboulis Watch a herd of wild guanacos in Patagonia National Park There's much to see and do in Parque Patagonia (Patagonia National Park), including watching wildlife, such as the graceful guanaco (a close relative to the llama). Visitors can also trek to restored wetlands and wander through the beautiful Chacabuco Valley. Afterward, relax in luxurious eco-comfort at the Lodge at Valle Chacabuco. This resort's modern stone and wood design was inspired by iconic national park lodges from around the world.

Photo courtesy of Dave Stamboulis Trek in Cerro Castillo National Park Another stunning Carretera Austral attraction is Cerro Castillo National Park and its lake (Lago Castillo). Named after its tallest mountain, this area is becoming a new option for trekkers wishing to avoid the massive crowds (and difficult permit system) of Torres del Paine further south. Hikers enjoy the circuit trail that runs through the park, taking travelers over windswept passes, under hanging glaciers and along the gorgeous emerald Lago Castillo. Advertisement Advertisement

Photo courtesy of Dave Stamboulis Gaze at the magnificent Cerro Castillo mountain You can see the entire Cerro Castillo peak from the highway, but a walk in the backcountry gives superlative closeups, prime camping opportunities and a taste for real Patagonian wilderness. The park is best visited between October and April, as the austral winter sees heavy snowfall. Fall colors here are also quite spectacular, as the lenga beech forests turn red.

Photo courtesy of Dave Stamboulis Admire the surreal Capilla de Mármol Natural Sanctuary The Capilla de Mármol Natural Sanctuary is a top Carretera highlight. Years of erosion by the water of Lake General Carrera have turned these coastal islets and caverns into a series of wind-sculpted pillars and caves and transformed the formations into a surreal pastel landscape (known both as the Marble Chapels and Marble Cathedrals). If you explore these incredible formations when the sunlight shines into the grottos, you'll have some superb photo opportunities.



Photo courtesy of Dave Stamboulis Kayak through the captivating caverns of Capilla de Mármol At Capilla de Mármol (Marble Cathedral), the optimal way to explore the caverns and colorful formations is by kayak, as they can access the small passageways that regular tour boats cannot. Capilla de Mármol is known to captivate geologists, photographers and outdoor adventure lovers. Nearby, it's also fun to visit the small village of Rio Tranquilo, as it's home to Patagonian cowboys, adventure travel agencies and cute places to stay. Advertisement Advertisement

Photo courtesy of Dave Stamboulis Hike to the Chaitén volcano caldera The Chaitén volcano erupted in 2008, after thousands of years of dormancy. It destroyed the nearby town of Chaitén and blanketed the surrounding region in ash. Today, this legendary volcano is part of the Pumalín National Park, and you can hike up to the caldera overlook for a stunning view. From here, you'll clearly see how the landscape has been altered, as well as how it has been regenerated over the years.

Photo courtesy of Dave Stamboulis Wander through a village that's frozen in time The tiny village of Chaitén still shows some of the devastation from the volcanic eruption, as several of the old homes sit seemingly frozen in time, looking exactly as they did in 2008. You'll also find an abundance of hot springs around this area, as well as a quarter of the population of Chile's alerce trees, which can live to up to 3,000 years.



Photo courtesy of Dave Stamboulis Visit Ventisquero Colgante, the hanging glacier Another noteworthy stop along the Carretera Austral is Queulat National Park. Here, you'll find the impressive Ventisquero Colgante hanging glacier, which crashes and pours into a waterfall below. You can hike up through the evergreen forest to a viewpoint above the waterfall, or for a unique perspective, take a boat trip on the lake that brings travelers underneath it.

Photo courtesy of Dave Stamboulis Relax in luxury on the Puyuhuapi fjord While visiting Queulat National Park, consider treating yourself to a night in Puyuhuapi, a nearby fjord that is home to the enticing Puyuhuapi Lodge and Spa, accessible only by boat. This luxurious destination features views of the fjord and the national park – and it's also home to a natural hot spring. It's a comfortable place to unwind and enjoy a bit of pampering in this rugged setting.

Photo courtesy of Dave Stamboulis Raft and kayak on the Futaleufú River Well worth a side trip, Futaleufú is a small town and river valley off the Carretera Austral (near the Argentinian border). It's home to the Futaleufú River, one of the premier rafting and kayaking water routes in South America. Futaleufú is an indigenous Mapuche word for ""Big River,"" and it attracts avid outdoor enthusiasts throughout the year. Fed by glacial melt, the water of the Futaleufú is a beautiful turquoise, and it's one of only two rivers that cross the over 3,000 mile Chile-Argentina border.

Photo courtesy of Dave Stamboulis View the famous Futaleufú River from above Considered one of the top whitewater destinations on the planet, Futaleufú (or the ""Fu"" as it's locally called) is home to Class V rapids, which includes the notorious Garganta del Diablo (Devil's Throat) waterfall, best viewed from off the water. The whitewater season here runs from December to April, and the town hosts an annual river festival during this timeframe. Fortunately, not all the sections of the Fu are so intense. Those seeking some serene kayaking can find several calm passages, and there is plenty of hiking nearby that offers stellar views of the river from above. Advertisement Advertisement

Photo courtesy of Dave Stamboulis Cross Lago General Carrera, Chile's largest lake The glacial General Carrera Lake is the largest along the Carretera (and in all of Chile for that matter), winding east into Argentina as well, where it's called Lake Buenos Aires. The beautiful Capilla de Mármol are set along its shores, and you can access the western end of Parque Patagonia from the lakeside town of Chile Chico. Road trippers can cut miles off of a Carretera drive here by taking the ferry across the lake to arrive near the base of Cerro Castillo. Be sure to check the weather report before heading out on the lake, as it has a reputation for being a treacherous body of water. This lake is nearly 2,000 feet deep in certain places, storms are frequent and the wind can be brutal. (Doug Tompkins, responsible for creating many of the country's national parks, was killed in a kayaking accident on this lake in 2015.)

Photo courtesy of Dave Stamboulis Hike through Pumalín National Park Parque Pumalín is home to the aforementioned Chaitén volcano, as well as several vast areas on the northern end of the Carretera Austral. Tranquil and expansive, there are many opportunities to enjoy nature here, including fjords where you can see dolphins and other wildlife. Just off the main road, you can hike through the tranquil forest to the Michinmahuida volcano, which boasts a long glacier and plenty of solitude. Afterwards, it's fun to soak in the Termas El Amarillo hot springs (located not far from the park gate).

Photo courtesy of Dave Stamboulis Hitch a ride to town Make sure to explore the funky ""wild west"" towns along the Carretera, like Cochrane, Puerto Rio Tranquilo or Villa O' Higgins. They offer plenty of local color. Hitchhiking on the Carretera Austral is extremely common, as bus services here are very limited. In most towns, you'll see backpackers, loaded down with camping equipment and lined up along both sides of the road throughout the day. Advertisement Advertisement

Photo courtesy of Dave Stamboulis Take it slow and soak it all in A journey along the Carretera Austral is not to be rushed. Most of all, be sure to slow down and soak in the experience. The local gauchos still travel by horse, and the regional sensibility is to enjoy life. As they say here, ""Quien se apura en Patagonia pierde el tiempo,"" meaning, ""He who rushes in Patagonia wastes time."" Personally, I believe it's a place to linger long and savor forever.",['Dave Stamboulis'],2023-04-17 00:00:00-04:00

At Tuesday’s New York City premiere of Nat Geo’s documentary “Wild Life,” Yvon Chouinard, founder of Patagonia, shed light on his 2022 decision to donate the entire apparel brand, worth $3 billion, to a trust dedicated to fighting the climate crisis.

“I’m kind of pessimistic about the fate of this planet,” Chouinard said. “We’ve been giving one percent of our sales for a long time. We’ve given away $200 or $300 million over the years, but I’m always thinking, ‘What more can I do?”

Directed by Oscar winners Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, “Wild Life” chronicles the decades-long efforts by conservationist Kris Tompkins and her late husband and the North Face founder, Doug Tompkins, to create national parks throughout Chile and Argentina. The couple helped Chouinard, who appears in the doc, create and run Patagonia.

Chouinard, who joined Vasarhelyi, Chin and Tompkins onstage after the MoMA screening, added that his decision to give the planet $3 billion also had to do with his two children, who have “simple lives” and no desire to inherit Patagonia.

“When we found a way to basically make earth our stockholder, it seemed real logical,” he continued. “It’s a way for Patagonia as a company to give a lot more money. We’ve given away $33 million since November. We’re going to give away another $40 or $50 [million] within the next couple months. It’s a pretty good system. I can tell you this: it’s not a burden. It’s really a lot of fun.”

As with their previous films “Free Solo” and “Meru,” Chin and Vasarhelyi’s “Wild Life” explores the world of elite climbers – in which Chin is a leading figure – mixing adventure footage that was shot in Chile’s Patagonia National Park, a former private reserve that Tompkins Conservation donated in 2018, with interviews and archival footage.

Chin, who climbed with both Doug Tompkins and Chouinard, was keen on making “Wild Life.” Tompkins on the other hand was wary.

“Jimmy just started showing up,” she explained. “I’d say what are you doing? And he would say, ‘I’m just going to film this stuff and we will see if something happens to it.’ Finally, it began to take shape and they asked me if I would be interested in something like this. I was reticent at first but then I thought if there was ever going to be a film about our story it would be with Jimmy and Chai. So I just put my life in their hands.

Vasarhelyi was also initially hesitant about the project, which will have a limited theatrical release beginning April 14 and stream on Disney+ May 25.

“He was like, we really should make a film about my mentors, the icons of the outdoor industry,” she recalled of her husband’s passion for the project. “But I don’t climb. I don’t ski. I don’t really go outside. So I was like, no way. Oh, no,” Vasarhelyi said.

Eventually the filmmaker came around and found herself captivated by Kris Tompkins’ life story and how she handled life after the death of her husband.

“It just became so compelling, this idea of Kris finding (her way),” Vasarhelyi said. “We made this film for our kids. Climate change is the existential question of our children’s generation. And this is a story that says very clearly, put one foot in front of the other and just try because trying matters.”

Spring is here, but much of the country still has chilly days ahead. One Redditor scored big at the thrift store on cold-weather essentials and heavy-duty brands that’ll withstand the test of time — and a surprise blizzard or two.

In a viral Reddit post, the user shares photos of their thrift store haul. They found Carhartt pants, a two-tone Patagonia vest, and a Levi’s lined denim jacket. This Redditor even hit the thrifting jackpot with a rare find: a vintage Pendleton Woolen Mills blanket from 1977.

This incredible haul came from the bins at a Goodwill Outlet where items are sold by the pound. This is the last stop before products are recycled. In other words, this Redditor scored these items for cheap.

The Pendleton Woolen Mills blanket is part of the Beaver State collection, a line of Native American–inspired trade blankets that date back to 1912.

This collection includes shawls, robes, and blankets that were originally made for the Walla Walla, Cayuse, and Umatilla tribes that neighbored Pendleton’s Oregon-based mill.

These blankets were used for ceremonial practices and trade between Indigenous tribes.

The company began commissioning Native American artists for their designs in the 1990s. Their blankets and clothing use colors, symbols, and patterns that represent Indigenous values and stories.

The blanket from this Reddit post has multiple listings on eBay for more than $100. Not only is this a fantastic deal, but Pendleton blankets are known for their high-quality wool and warmth.

Carhartt, Patagonia, and Levi’s are brands also recognized for their durable, warm, and fashionable clothing, making these items the perfect late-winter haul.

Thrifting has become increasingly popular in recent years as consumers focus on finding unique secondhand pieces that are budget and environment-friendly. About 82% of Americans buy or sell pre-owned items.

Thrifting scores like this one can save shoppers almost $150 a month or $1,760 a year on average.

In the post’s comment section, Redditors share their congratulations and envy over these thrift store finds.

“Super jealous,” one user writes. “Great finds!”

“That’s an awesome haul. Especially love that sherpa-lined denim jacket,” another user says.

https://news.yahoo.com/kristine-tompkins-helped-conserve-15-110035000.html,How Kristine Tompkins Helped Conserve 15 Million Acres in Patagonia,"This article originally appeared on Outside

In the early 1990s, Kristine McDivitt, then the CEO of Patagonia, was at a cafe in El Calafate, Argentina, when a man named Doug Tompkins sat down next to her. ""Hey, kid, how ya doing?"" he asked. Doug was the best friend and climbing buddy of her boss, Yvon Chouinard, and he was known as a brilliant, arrogant bon vivant. In 1964, Doug had cofounded the North Face with his first wife, Susie Tompkins Buell. Seven years later, the two started another clothing company, Esprit. After cashing out, he moved to Chile to live alone in a small cabin.

Kristine, a free-spirited California girl who had worked her way up the ladder at Patagonia after an entry-level, two-dollar-an-hour ""assistant packing"" job in her teens, knew Doug's reputation. So when he tried to convince her to stay in South America with him, she demurred. (She also happened to be engaged to another man at the time.) But he was persistent. Months later, a five-day visit to Chile to see the farm Doug had purchased at the edge of a fjord turned into five weeks. Finally, Kristine returned to the States, ""blew up her personal life,"" and never looked back--by 1993 she had quit her job, married Doug, and moved into his cabin.

For the next two decades, the pair lived between remote homes in Chile and Argentina, only occasionally returning to California. They had a grand plan: buy and protect as much land threatened by logging and overgrazing as possible. Eventually, through a series of nonprofits run by the Tompkinses, the couple purchased hundreds of thousands of acres from ranchers and absentee landowners. Their fairy-tale life ended in tragedy in 2015, when Doug died in a kayaking accident in Chile at 72. Wracked with grief, Kristine was left alone at the helm of Tompkins Conservation, which was on the cusp of making the largest private land donation in history, to take the form of numerous national parks granted to the governments of Chile and Argentina.

Who better to capture this epic saga of love and loss on film than the Oscar-winning couple of Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin? Their new documentary, Wild Life, follows Kristine Tompkins's trajectory from barefoot Southern California girl to CEO of one of the most influential outdoor brands in the country to champion of conservation. The film will debut in select theaters starting April 14 and will be available to stream on May 26 on Disney+.

Chin met the Tompkinses through Chouinard and Rick Ridgeway, a climber and former Patagonia vice president. ""Doug, Yvon, and Rick have all been heroes to me since I started out as a young dirtbag climber and photographer living in Yosemite,"" Chin said in an email. And after spending time with Kristine, he ""quickly learned that she is a force of nature, an incredible human being. So of course, taking on this film was something deeply personal to me.""

Before Doug died, Chin had visited the couple in South America and shot footage of them, noodling on the notion of making a film. After the kayaking accident, he and Vasarhelyi approached Kristine about putting together a movie of her life. ""It took me a while to think that a film like this should be made,"" said Kristine, adding that she only gave her approval because she thought it would be good for encouraging conservation efforts. ""I decided if I was going to do it, I would do it only with Jimmy and Chai. They are extraordinary filmmakers and trusted friends.""

Wild Life delves into the Tompkinses' years of joy and struggle and the aftermath of the tragedy, as told through intimate interviews with Kristine and a close circle of lifelong companions. Chin's signature stunning photography of Chile and Argentina is intercut with 1960s footage of America's original climbing, skiing, and surfing dirtbag royalty: Kristine singing the Beach Boys' ""California Girls""; the Grateful Dead playing at the opening of the first North Face store; Chouinard, Doug, and their funhog crew unfurling a flag after their historic ascent of Fitz Roy. The clips add levity and also bring into focus that, even before they were a couple, the Tompkinses were fundamental players in the creation myth of modern American outdoor culture.

It's clear that Doug and Kristine were soulmates. Yet they were also intense overachievers committed to conservation work in countries that were often suspicious of and hostile toward their efforts--some Chileans, for example, thought that the couple's real aim was to populate their land with American bison. The pair rarely had time to explore together. In the film, Kristine sets out to climb a 7,500-foot peak in Patagonia's Chacabuco Valley that her husband and Chouinard first summited in 2009. Doug dubbed the peak Cerro Kristine. Chouinard and Ridgeway--both were on the kayaking expedition that killed Doug--accompany Kristine on her journey to reach the summit, along with Chin and professional rock climber Timmy O'Neill. ""Why did we never climb our mountain together?"" Kristine asks the clouds as she stands alone, looking out over Patagonia National Park.

The documentary is a testament to fierce love and how its power can serve a greater purpose. ""There was a deep, deep union and devotion to each other, and they came together with a common vision,"" says friend and filmmaker Edgar Boyle in Wild Life. But the grief that resulted when that union was severed by tragedy is difficult to watch. At one point, Kristine recounts, while flying with Doug's remains to his final resting place near their home in the Chacabuco Valley, she carved their names in the coffin with a small knife. ""Doug's death was an amputation,"" Kristine told me. ""I took some long walks by myself and was never sure I'd turn around and walk back.""

The only way forward was to dive even further into her conservation work. With the help of a roughly 300-person staff at Tompkins Conservation, she exceeded her late husband's dream of creating 12 national parks. The current count: 15, along with two marine parks and a total of 14.8 million protected acres in Chile and Argentina--an area roughly the size of West Virginia. Those numbers keep expanding, along with Kristine's seemingly endless supply of energy to continue the work she started with her husband. ""I carry Doug around in my pocket. If I get really stuck on something, I simply ask: 'What would you do?' I am just grateful that we have this marriage,"" she said, still speaking of their union in the present tense. ""It's given me unbelievable strength.""

Kristine is still the president of Tompkins Conservation, but she has relinquished day-to-day operations to focus primarily on strategy. In late February, she met with Chilean president Gabriel Boric to move forward with a proposed donation of 230,000 acres on behalf of Tompkins Conservation, with a view toward creating national park number 16 at Cape Froward, on the Brunswick Peninsula, the southernmost point of the continent. The rugged, largely unexplored region is a refuge for endangered species like the huemul deer. The proposal reclassifies state land that, if included, would make the area bigger than Grand Teton National Park. In recent years, two independent local organizations have spun off from Tompkins Conservation. Rewilding Chile and Rewilding Argentina each work in their respective countries to bring back endangered species--from the Andean condor in Patagonia National Park to the jaguar in Argentina's Ibera National Park.

""I want people to realize that this film is not about Doug and Kristine,"" she told me. ""It's the representation of hundreds of Chileans' and Argentines' work. Mother Nature is not winning this game. We are all on the losing team, and everybody needs to join the fight.""

https://news.yahoo.com/former-patagonia-ceo-rose-marcario-032200180.html,"Former Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario delivers CWA keynote on leadership, ethics","Apr. 13—Former Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario delivered her CWA keynote address at CU Boulder on Thursday in an informal Q&A session, touching on topics such as ethics, leadership and activism.

During her 12 years at Patagonia, Marcario deepened the company's commitment to advocacy, environmental activism and responsible business. She left Patagonia in June 2020 and is now a founding partner with ReGen Ventures, a board member and adviser to environmental impact companies and chair of Rivian's Forever Foundation for nature.

Marcario discussed how many corporations do not operate with sustainability in mind. She said many are operating as ""unregulated monopolies"" in an ""inequitable society"" with a few billionaires controlling massive amounts of assets.

""If we stopped right now all innovation, we already have all the tools and all of the technology to curb the climate crisis,"" Marcario said. ""What we don't have is investment.""

Despite this, Marcario said she believes we can create a ""livable future."" She called on the audience to look at their sphere of influence — whether that's school, family, friends, work — and ask how they can make a change. She said to vote, be an advocate and understand the issues in your neighborhood.

Aside from the topic of businesses, Marcario answered many questions about her leadership skills and personal experiences, specifically as a woman and member of the LGBTQ community.

""I define leadership as love. Love that creates outcomes of purpose,"" Marcario said. ""When I say love, I mean you can't get incredible results without creating this feeling of love and excitement for an aspirational vision of our future.""

Longmont resident Roz Bliss said she knew a bit about Patagonia before attending Marcario's keynote. She said she thinks it's an interesting company and she wanted to hear about how Marcario led it.

Story continues

Gunbarrel resident Pat Fay attended Marcario's keynote and said he appreciated the vision Marcario had for Patagonia and her leadership.

""It's being uncompromising in that vision and being able to communicate and share that vision so that other people jump on board,"" Fay said.

Marcario said the good news is she's seeing more founders and company CEOs realize the urgency of the climate crisis. She said she's seeing more money being put into foundations to help such causes and said company advocacy is important.

""Advocacy is just saying, this is what I believe. This is what the company believes in. And I don't think there's anything wrong with doing that. But what's wrong, and what most companies hide behind, is what they believe is not so good,"" Marcario said. ""They might believe in your destruction, they might believe in your food supply being destroyed by pesticides. So, I think advocacy is going to become the new norm.""

https://www.gq.com/story/david-granns-profile-wager-killers-of-the-flower-moon,This Is David Grann’s Next Big Adventure Story,"The writer David Grann had been reading about Wager Island for years when he finally decided to see it for himself. A boggy speck that abruptly rises out of the Pacific Ocean on the Chilean coast of Patagonia, it’s named for the British Royal Navy vessel that wrecked just offshore in 1741. One hundred forty-five men were stranded on the island, where strict military order rapidly gave way to mutiny, cannibalism, and murder. Grann had spent countless hours poring over the contradictory, self-serving accounts of the sailors, combing through archives in England and squinting at 18th-century handwriting, but he still felt like there would be something missing from his understanding until he went there. The remote island is just as desolate as it was nearly 300 years ago, but he found a Chilean captain willing to undertake the multi-day voyage in a simple boat heated by a wood stove. “It was not,” he told me, “one of the smarter things I’ve ever done.”

And he’s a smart guy, a longtime staff writer for the New Yorker (which, like GQ, is owned by Condé Nast) and a best-selling author. He specializes in gripping historical chronicles and crime stories, filled with fearless explorers and ruthless killers, with twists and double-crosses so rich in intrigue that they would strain credulity in fiction. But Grann’s stories are all true, and because they actually happened, because every detail is invariably backed up by some unearthed court testimony or a dusty file plucked from a long-neglected archive, he’s become one of our culture’s leading sources of holy shit page-turners.

His latest book,The Wager, which comes out this week, spins out the story of the shipwreck and mutiny by weaving together the rival accounts of the ship’s gentleman captain, a lower-class gunner, and a 16-year-old midshipman. The doomed ship left England as part of a squadron on a secret mission to intercept a Spanish treasure galleon loaded with silver, which meant weathering the dangerous storms below Cape Horn, at the southern tip of South America. It’s an adventure, guaranteed to please fans of the seafaring novels of Patrick O’Brian and the movie they inspired, Master and Commander—and, by extension, history-loving dads everywhere.

But where O’Brian’s books look back at the Age of Sail through an idealized haze, there’s not much to romanticize in The Wager: The expedition is crewed by old men and invalids, the boat disintegrates in the gales of the Southern Ocean, and the bodies of the scurvy-ridden sailors melt off of their bones. The expedition is revealed to be a boondoggle at best, and probably something far more sinister. Grann has managed to push the conventions of true crime and pop history into something more meaningful: The Wager is a story about a shipwreck, but it’s also about how the men who somehow made it off the island told their competing accounts, which became the sensational true-crime of their day, and watching Grann make sense of the tangle raises fascinating questions about how stories take on a life of their own.

The film rights to The Wager were sold to two of the biggest names in Hollywood long before the book was even printed—the plan is for it to be turned into a movie directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio. The pair have already adapted Grann’s previous book, Killers of the Flower Moon, which recounts a murderous conspiracy in 1920s Oklahoma targeting wealthy but vulnerable Osage Indians and the oil on their land. That movie, which stars Robert De Niro, Brendan Fraser, and Lily Gladstone alongside DiCaprio, will premiere at Cannes next month, before a wide release this fall. It isn’t the first story of Grann’s to be adapted. Most notably, 2006’s The Lost City of Z became a 2016 movie of the same name, and the Old Man and the Gun, Robert Redford’s final film role, was a modest hit. But none have yet been produced on close to this scale: Killers of the Flower Moon is already perhaps the most-anticipated film of the year, with awards-season buzz before anyone has even seen it. It’s the biggest kind of (non-comic book) movie that Hollywood still makes, and Grann is in some way on the precipice of becoming the culture’s foremost (non-comic book) storyteller.","['Condé Nast', 'Chris Cohen']",2023-04-16 12:00:00+00:00
https://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/tripideas/the-best-honeymoon-destinations-according-to-a-travel-expert/ar-AA19B1D9,"The best honeymoon destinations, according to a travel expert","Not only are you planning the most important day of your life but you’re also expected to organize an amazing trip to enjoy directly after your wedding, too? While plenty of people opt to go on their honeymoon a couple days or weeks (even years) after their big day to avoid extra stress, the endless options on where to go can get a bit overwhelming no matter what timeline you go with.

In an effort to help you choose the best honeymoon destination for your needs, wants and budget, we spoke with Andrew Satkowiak, executive vice president for The Luxury Travel Agency to get his top recommendations.

From a safari-filled trip in South Africa, the romantic vineyards of Tuscany, adventurous accommodations in Patagonia or even something a bit closer to home in Hawaii, there’s an option for all couples.

“I like to think of a honeymoon as a once in a lifetime event,” Satkowiak said. “Some people want a destination that they’ve never been to and probably would never go back to — to keep the honeymoon as a special memory and other people want to go to a destination they’re more familiar with, in the end it really comes down to what the client is looking for.”

Ahead get the 411 on the best honeymoon destinations of 2023.

If you have plenty of time and PTO isn’t an issue, a honeymoon in Australia would be an unforgettable memory.

“You can climb [the] Sydney Harbor Bridge, do a private tour of the Sydney Opera House or a private behind the scenes [tour] of Taronga Zoo in Sydney,” Satkowiak suggested. “Hike in the Blue Mountains, [go on] wine tours in Adelaide, spend a day on Whitsunday Islands (or do helicopter tour), [enjoy] a guided café crawl in Melbourne or a restaurant tasting tour in Sydney.”

Where to stay in Sydney: For a spectacular high-end pick, you can’t go wrong with the Four Seasons Hotel. If you’re looking for something a bit more affordable and near Bondi Beach go with The Baxley Bondi hotel.

Where to stay in Melbourne: The Westin Melbourne is a great choice for those who want to be in a centrally located area to see the most of the city.

New Zealand can easily be paired in the same trip to Australia although both countries could also be done very well during separate vacations.

“In New Zealand, a few days in Queenstown is a must as is a visit to Milford Sound and a Fiorland helicopter tour. If you’re adventurous, you can try a Dart River Jetboat adventure and go bungee jumping off Kawarau Bridge. If time allows, try fly fishing in Taupo, sailing on Lake Taupo, wine tours, hiking, private picnics and much more,” Satkowiak said of honeymooning in New Zealand.

Where to stay in Queenstown: Situated directly on the shores of Lake Wakatipu, the Hilton Queenstown Resort & Spa boasts famous waterfront and mountain views — a place you won’t regret booking.

For the adventurous couple who loves wildlife, a trip to South Africa is the way to go.

“A trip to South Africa must include some time in the vibrant city of Cape Town (Johannesburg is worth a visit too). It has a diverse and colorful culture, a great dining scene and tons of things to do in town and nearby,” Satkowiak told The Post. “Wine tours in the Winelands, shark cage diving, mountain hiking, visiting the African penguins going to see where the Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean meet. And of course, no trip to South Africa is complete without a few days on safari!”

“South Africa’s safari lodges are some of the very best lodges in the world with many of the located on private game reserves which just adds to the remoteness and peace of the whole experience. It often feels like you have the whole country just to yourself!” Satkowiak said.

Where to stay in Cape Town: The Westin Cape Town is a great, centrally located spot with unique views over the V&A Waterfront, Table Mountain and the whole of Table Bay.

Where to stay in Kruger National Park: For an incredible safari experience the Imbali Safari Lodge is a no-brainer. With limited cell reception, romantic suites with private plunge pools, personalized safari tours and exquisite service, you won’t be disappointed.

Another popular option for honeymooning is Bali. It’s insanely beautiful and quite in-expensive once you get there — making it ultra appealing to many.

“Bali is a tropical paradise with stunning scenery, delicious cuisine, and a rich culture. It’s [also] a perfect destination for those with a more typical budget of time (7-10 days),” Satkowiak said. “Bali is known for its peaceful atmosphere [so] it’s perfect for newlyweds who want to unwind and enjoy each other’s company.”

“Bali has some of the most stunning landscapes in the world,” Satkowiak said before mentioning the emerald rice paddies throughout the countryside are one of his favorites.” Couples can explore these natural wonders on hikes, bike tours, or simply relax and soak in the beauty of their surroundings.”

Other activities include sunset cruises, sunrise hikes, white water rafting, trekking along the rice terraces and for the less active travelers, the resorts are perfect for lounging and most of them offer world class spas.

Where to stay in Bali: Immerse in authentic Balinese culture at the Four Seasons Resort Bali at Jimbaran Bay — an ocean-side, all-villa beach retreat that features a hand-crafted furniture, stunning views and incredible staff. For an equally as special but less-expensive option, consider the Kelapa Retreat and Spa.

“Known worldwide for their luxury over-water villa, the Maldives has a plethora of resorts to choose from. Each has its own unique character, distinctive style and atmosphere,” Satkowiak said. “With each island only having just one resort on it, privacy is one of the biggest benefits of the Maldives, that, plus the crystal clear water, white sand beaches and of course, the sunny blue skies.”

“To make it even more private, many of the villas have their own private pools. Nothing says romance like having your own pool,” Satkowiak told The Post.

According to Satkowiak, while most people think of the Maldives as a place to relax, there’s plenty of activity to do including snorkeling, scuba diving, private sunset cruises, boat charters, mingling with locals, private romantic dinners, wine tasting, star gazing, cooking classes and more. Another big draw to the Maldives? The spas!

Satkowiak also often recommends his client’s add a few days in Dubai, Istanbul or London, to the start or end of their time in the Maldives, depending on where they’re coming from since most flights to the islands stop in the locations.

Where to stay in the Maldives: The Four Seasons Resort Maldives At Landaa Giraavaru or the JW Marriott Maldives Resort & Spa are two options that anyone would enjoy. Both offer incredible scenery, outstanding service and private villas to create the most romantic honeymoon.

According to Satkowiak, Patagonia is bucket list trip for many honeymoon clients.

“This gives a great mix of both adventure, awe-dropping views, romance and unforgettable excursions,” he said. “Spanning into Chile and Argentina Patagonia is one of the most unique destinations in the world. With tons of lakes, glaciers and the snow-capped Andres mountains, there is a little something for everyone to do.”

In the winter travelers can ski, trek on glaciers, enjoy winter hikes, go canoeing or kayaking in icebergs. During the summer you can hike, go on 4×4 excursions, splurge on a scenic helicopter tour, go white water rafting, fly fishing and horseback riding, just to name a few activities.

If you and your partner enjoy wine, Mendoza is another great option in Argentina.

“Here visitors can visit wineries to do some wine tasting and learn all about the wine making process,” Satkowiak said.

“Mendoza has some of the most exceptional lodging options, small boutique options — the perfect destination to truly escape the hustle and bustle of life and really connect with your new spouse.”

Where to stay in the Patagonia: While you can certainly find budget-friendly ways to enjoy the beauty of Patagonia, most will recommend spending a bit more money, especially during a special trip like your honeymoon. An estancia (a South American cattle ranch or stock farm) — all-inclusive, luxury lodge like Estancia Cristina, located in the north arm of the Lago Argentino is a great option.

Where to stay in the Mendoza: The Casa de Uco Vineyards & Wine Hotel boasts just 19 rooms, winery tours, a vineyard, and a tasting room, plus a spa and a high-end, on-site restaurant.

For those looking to experience the incredible Iguazú Falls, the luxury Awasi Iguazú treehouse-esque hotel is all-inclusive and outstanding.

“From its history and culture to the scenery, fashion and of course the food, Italy is a spectacular destination! Most first timers to Italy tend to visit Florence, Rome and Venice,” Satkowiak said before mentioning the wine region of Italy, Tuscany.

“The Tuscany region is surely one of the most picturesque and beautiful areas that I’ve visited. You don’t need to be a wine aficionado to enjoy that region but it surely does help. Depending on how much time you have, it’s very easy to tie in [Florence, Rome and Venice] or another popular add-on would be the Amalfi Coast and Capri.:

Where to stay in Florence: For an extra special treat, go with the Four Seasons Hotel Firenze. For those looking for something a bit more affordable, Hotel Pendini is a great option, too.

Where to stay in Rome: Hotel Artemide is one of the best hotels in Rome for it’s incredible service and amenities but more so for it’s location. Walk to just about any attraction directly from your hotel! Enjoy an incredible buffet breakfast, as well.

Where to stay in Venice: The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection Hotel in Venice is housed in a 15th century noble palazzo and one of the most iconic and romantic properties in Europe. Overlooking the Grand Canal, the property boasts one of the most majestic views in the city, spanning from the island of San Giorgio Maggiore past Punta della Dogana and the Basilica of Santa Maria della Salute to the Peggy Guggenheim Collection.

For a special experience about 20-minutes outside the city, consider the JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa. Settled on its own private island in Venice, Isola delle Rose, the property features 40-acres of gardens, olive groves and exceptional amenities.

Where to stay in Tuscany: The Renaissance Tuscany Il Ciocco Resort & Spa is located on 1,700 acres in the heart of the Serchio Valley and is the perfect destination for your Italian getaway. Enjoy ideal access to charming and historic attractions including Pisa.

Where to stay in the Amalfi Coast: The Anantara Convento di Amalfi Grand Hotel is a fabulous 5-star option in the Amalfi Coast that was once home to Capuchin Monks. Featuring an infinity pool, elegant decor, exquisite views and more.

“Los Cabos is a popular destination for honeymoons especially with its close proximity to the western side of the US. The array and options for top-end hotels and resorts is unparalleled to most other honeymoon spots in Mexico and the Caribbean,” Satkowiak said. “There really is something for everyone in addition to that they’ve got a great restaurant scene and a lot of water based activities, plus some charming towns nearby which are worth a visit.”

Where to stay in Los Cabos: Corazon Cabo Resort & Spa is situated on Medano Beach and steps away from everything else you could want in Cabo. Another great option is the JW Marriott Los Cabos Beach Resort & Spa. Boasting a beachfront location in San Jose del Cabo, where the Sea of Cortez meets the Pacific Ocean, this JW Marriott location is perfect place to celebrate your marriage.

Last but not least, Hawaii — a classic honeymoon location that won’t disappoint!

“Maui is the perfect destination for [travelers] that want to be around people, have great shopping, restaurants and great beach life. Maui offers all types of land and water activities for you to enjoy,” Satkowiak said. “Maui also [offers] some of the beat Luau’s in all of Hawaii.”

Expert tip: Whale season is from mid-November to Mid-May in Maui.

After spending some time in Maui, Satkowiak recommends venturing to Kauai for a totally different experience.

“Kauai [is] lush, idyllic, peaceful and serene,” he said. “If you are looking for great scenery, outdoor adventure and being ‘off the grid’ [this is the place for you].”

“The island has jagged costal cliffs, deep emerald valleys waterfalls and sea caves – truly an amazing island. This island gives you a good mix of romance, outdoor adventure and culinary and cultural experiences,” Satkowiak said.

Where to stay in Maui: AC Hotel by Marriott Maui Wailea or the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea (where The White Lotus season 1 was filmed!) are two great options that offer amazing views, great service and amenties.

Where to stay in Kauai: The Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort & Spa is set on the soothing white sands in Poipu (Kauai’s sunny south shore) over 50 acres of lush gardens.

It also has a reputation for being the best ""just-in-case"" bag for travelers, so I put it to the test.

Travel + Leisure / Reese Herrington

A good tote bag is worth its weight in gold — especially one that works no matter where you are going or what you are doing. Recently, I took the Patagonia Ultralight Black Hole Tote Pack on a trip to Mexico City because I wanted something other than my purse to use while out and about exploring the town. Much to my surprise, I'd enlisted the help of one of the most versatile travel bags I've ever encountered — it is three bags in one, after all.

This tote was convenient to pack because it folds down to the size of a paperback book and I could add it to my laptop case when not in use. But, if you were to carry it on the plane, it fits under an airplane seat without being too bulky. It is the perfect cross between a duffle bag, a backpack, and a purse. From running errands around town, hiking, shopping, sightseeing, or even going on an adventure, it carries your essentials effortlessly.

As previously mentioned, the Patagonia Ultralight Black Hole Tote Pack boasts impressive versatility, and users can easily customize its multitasking design with its three different carrying options — by hand, over your shoulder, or even on your back like a traditional backpack. I was carrying it on my shoulder as I was shopping around the streets of Mexico City’s La Condesa neighborhood to keep my wallet handy while shopping, but seamlessly turned it into a backpack as soon as we walked into the National Museum of Anthropology because I wanted to be hands-free and careful around all the beautiful artifacts.

Travel + Leisure / Emily Belfiore

I also found the pack to be quite strong and durable. Like many of Patagonia’s products, this one is made of 100 percent recycled nylon and is weather resistant with its durable and waterproof silicone and polyurethane coatings, which is good news if your trip forecast will be plagued with inclement weather.

Story continues

Beyond its multipurpose exterior, the Black Hole Tote Pack is also stocked with thoughtful features to delight any traveler. The internal compression straps and the bungee cord are game changers because you can really stuff the convertible backpack to the brim, and still have room to close it with the large zipper at the top.

There's also an internal zippered pocket, which acts as prime storage to keep essentials like your wallet, keys, and smartphone secure, whereas the external zippered pocket will prove to be more useful to stow away less valuable (but still highly precious) travel items like sunglasses, lip balm, or sunscreen — a.k.a. things that you might need in a pinch and don't want to dig through inside your bag for. I also appreciated the two stretch-mesh water-bottle pockets on the outside; I could store away both my reusable bottles as I walked around the city and did not worry about running out of water.

Pockets aside, one thing that really surprised me was how comfortable the bag was to carry. I am always cautious of how traditional backpack harnesses will fit my somewhat shorter frame. But, the ones on the Patagonia Ultralight Black Hole Tote Pack are adjustable and made from highly breathable mesh, so not only does it fit like a glove, but it also doesn’t get too sweaty or uncomfortable with extended use. They also neatly tuck away when using the pack over your shoulder or holding it in your hand — another unexpectedly thoughtful design feature.

With a 27-liter capacity and a 15.5-inch by 10.3-inch by 8-inch frame, this pack can fit a lot of stuff, and I found it so helpful that I got rid of my hefty travel purse and put everything I needed in this bag for most of my trip. When not in use, it weighs 13 ounces and can be stuffed into its pocket for easy packing, which is why it's been dubbed as the best “just-in-case” bag by REI shoppers. One reviewer wrote, “I purchased this packable tote bag just in case my daypack was too small for the conference I was going to. This bag was a lifesaver and went above and beyond for an entire week.""

Travel + Leisure / Emily Belfiore

Another customer called it a “perfect travel bag” because of its versatility, which is what I appreciated as well during my travels: “I love the bag because of how functional it is. The top straps are long enough to carry it under your arm (a common problem with these bags). It's perfect for conferences, groceries, walking around town, bike commutes, and trips to the dog park.""

I hate to admit it, but I got the Patagonia Ultralight Black Hole Tote Pack with the intent of shoving it in my suitcase and using it only if needed while traveling. But after it proved to be so useful in Mexico City, I find myself reaching for it regularly. Outside of traveling, it is the perfect size to carry groceries, my gym gear, or anything I need for a day out and about. So, if you are looking for a great multi-purposeful bag (and a backup for extra storage when you're traveling), this is the one for you.

I know I will be bringing the Patagonia Ultralight Black Hole Tote Pack along for all my travels this year and beyond. So, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and get one for yourself at REI. If its almost-$100 price tag is a bit of a deterrent, don't fret; keep scrolling to shop some of the best (and affordable) convertible backpacks that can also be used as tote bags, everyday purses, and more.

Argentina’s Route 40 is not that kind of road trip.

“La Cuarenta,” as it’s known, is a beast—a white whale of a road trip that requires legitimate planning and an insatiable appetite for adventure. The payoff? The satisfaction of conquering one of the most beautiful stretches of road on the planet.

To do the whole thing means tackling 3,227 miles of highway—the equivalent of driving from New York to Los Angeles, then tacking on a trip to Seattle. It runs along the Andes mountains, from the arid town of La Quiaca on the Bolivian border all the way down to icy Cabo Vírgenes at the southern tip of South America.

Along the way, you’ll wind through volcanic lava fields, ancient forests, and shimmering salt flats. You’ll see sprawling national parks, turquoise lakes, massive glaciers, and multicolored rock formations. Whether you tackle the entire Ruta or opt for a shorter portion, this is an adventure like no other. Here’s how to make it happen, and a preview of the beauty that awaits. © Gabor Kovacs /500Px Plus/Getty Images

When to go

The best time to visit Argentina is November and December, when the road is lined with gorgeous, colorful lupine flowers; or in January and February, when temperatures rise (along with prices and crowds).

Where to rent a vehicle

Assuming you flew into Buenos Aires to explore the “Paris of South America,"" you’ll catch a two-hour flight to your launching point of Bariloche. From there, you’ve got options: Patagonia Austral Rent A Car will deliver your car to you, or if you prefer a 4x4, try booking through Campanada. For a tricked-out camper van situation, the closest Wicked Van company is in Puerto Varas, Chile: It’s a few hours away, but worth it if you have your heart set on #vanlife.

Bariloche is by far the biggest city on the route, so gather any needed camping supplies, and stock up on good wine or snacks for the road. One more thing: You’re going to see a lot of hitchhikers on this road trip. This is both legal and extremely common here. Don’t feel obligated to stop, of course, and always trust your gut. Got it? Time to hit the road. © Pav-Pro Photography Ltd/Shutterstock

Bariloche to Siete Lagos

This essential stretch of the Ruta 40 begins and ends in Bariloche—either a 119 mile there-and-back, or a 162-mile loop through Junín de los Andes—and is all about the water. One of the most beautiful places you’re likely to see on this adventure, the area’s name translates to Seven Lakes. That’s actually selling it short, as this landscape is dotted with seemingly endless bodies of water.

From the glaciers of Mount Tronador in Nahuel Huapi National Park, the route runs through the Valdivian Jungle at Puerto Blest. Eventually you’ll get tired of pulling over and trying to photograph the incredible turquoise colors and surreal clarity of the lakes. Among them is Lago Correntoso, home to some of the best fly fishing on Earth; Lago Espejo—Mirror Lake— whose calm, transparent waters are impossibly pure; the highly isolated 21-square-mile Licar; and Mirador del Pil Pil, perhaps the most stunning viewpoint in this section of Argentina.

A good place to stop midday for lunch is at Pistach' in Villa La Angostura: It’s no exaggeration to say that their wood-fired pizzas are some of the best in Argentina. Then it’s back to Bariloche before the roads become increasingly longer. © Manuel Sulzer/Image Source/Getty Images

Bariloche to El Bolson

Pack a little extra patience: This 75-mile section of constantly winding road can be slow-going, but it’s worth it for the spectacular mountain views. At no other point on your road trip will you feel so close to the Andes.

Bolson is the anti-Bariloche, ditching sailboats and nightclubs in favor of lazy days at the artist’s market and day hikes along the Cajon del Azul, a three-hour (one way) intermediate level hike starting from a river confluence 15 miles from town. Cajon del Azul is both the name of a canyon and of a wildly popular and commercial mountain refuge. For those who appreciate something more quiet and tranquil, keep walking just a bit more until you reach Retamal refuge or Casa de Campo.

Finish the evening out with live music and raspberry beer back in town at the Patio Cervecero. If you aren’t careful, this town will suck you in: Suddenly you’re building your own tiny adobe house, living off the land, and popping into town every once in a while just to eat gelato from Jauja. (It happened to me. Highly recommended.)

While here, meander over to Lago Puelo, a town whose namesake national park offers prime kayaking and swimming. After whiling the afternoon away, stop into Mavyska for a dinner of the best traditional comfort food (think lamb or trout) in Argentine Patagonia.

El Bolson to Epuyen

While Argentina is known for its malbec from Mendoza, this region’s cooler weather helps to put out some nice pinot noir. On your way out of town, stop by Bodega de Bernardi , a quaint, small-scale vineyard. Grab as many bottles as you can, because you sure won’t be able to find these in your local supermarket back home.

Ten minutes from Bolson is a town called El Hoyo, where you should stop to check out a waterfall: If you are lucky, you might even spot a condor nest at the top. Ten to 15 minutes from there is Epuyen, home of gorgeous Lago Epuyen. Explore the lake with Epuyen SUP, then camp for the night. Notable in the area is the Laberinto, the largest labyrinth in South America. © Alex Eggermont/Image Source/Getty Images

Epuyen to Piedra Parada region

When you leave Epuyen, you’ll begin your journey into the Patagonian steppe. A couple of hours in, veer a bit off the 40 to check out Piedra Parada, a desert rock-climbing destination that looks like it belongs in prehistoric times, complete with secret caves, crystals, and fossils. Accommodations are scarce here, so home base will either be a tent at a small campsite by the large rock formation or at Hosteria Mirador Huancache in the nearest village of Gualjaina—their guides are by far the best in the region and can get you to all the cool little-known spots in the area.

For those who come for climbing, there are over 300 routes on walls over 180 feet high that have ongoing bolting. Most of the routes are along high canyon walls and offer a mix between sport, trad, and multi-pitch. Trekking and taking a dip in the very hidden El Saltillo waterfall is a must before heading further south. The experience is a bit like finding your own private waterfall tucked in the Grand Canyon.

Directions to the falls are a bit tricky, as the dirt roads aren’t well-marked and you have to pass through the property of a local first—ask the gatekeeper if there are fresh torta fritas available to buy if you want to make a quick friend of the grandma who makes them. It may take a few tries to find the waterfall, but think of it as just part of the adventure. © Huemules - Reserva de Montaña

Piedra Parada to Esquel

Just under two hours from Piedra Parada is Esquel, a mid-sized town with a few breweries to check out and the first actual grocery store you’ll encounter since Bolson—so if you need to stock up, now’s the time.

Here you’ll find Los Alerces National Park, which protects more than 15,000 acres of magnificent Alerce trees (relatives of the North American redwood). Some trees in this park are over 2,600 years old. You can camp within the park (with an advance reservation), or maybe opt for a geodesic dome at Los Huemules Reserva de Montana. Here you can ride horses, mountain bike or just throw on a poncho, curl up with some malbec and take in some of the best stargazing on the planet.

If you’re into historic stuff, next to Ruta 40 is an old steam engine train known as the Viejo Expreso Patagónico (""Old Patagonian Express"") or La Trochita. It makes short, touristy, and very Instagrammable jaunts between Esquel and Maiten. © ymgerman/Shutterstock

Esquel to El Calafate/ El Chalten

Up until this point, you’ve gotten the Patagonia-lite road trip. After Esquel, Route 40 grows increasingly desolate—think vast, expansive views and whipping winds. The next real stop isn’t for another 15 or 16 hours. Understandably, most people turn back north to Bariloche. If your rental car allows drop-off at a different city than pick-up, you can hop on a domestic flight in Calafate to most any major city in the country, too.

But if you don’t mind roughing it with a little overnight car camping, it’s worth pushing on. And don’t worry: If you spot pink flamingos, you are not just overtired and hallucinating— they’re partial to roadside lagoons.

The reward is Los Glaciares National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that encompasses the vast glaciers of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, including the famous Perito Moreno Glacier in Calafate. To see massive chunks of ice calving off and landing like bombs (sound and all) in the water is something you will never forget. Serious hikers and photographers should also plan an extra few days to head over to the jagged, 11,000-foot granite peak of nearby Mount Fitz Roy in Chalten. Pretty much half of the stock photos of Argentine Patagonia you will see are of Fitz Roy —it’s classic southern Patagonia, with gnarly gusts, wildflower blooms, glacial lakes, condors flying overhead, and views that make you feel tiny. Nearby is another UNESCO World Heritage Site, Cueva de los Manos, which has rock art painted by Paleoindians, estimated at 9,300 years old.

By the end of this trip, you will be exhausted and exhilarated. You will have seen more beauty in a couple of weeks than you may have previously imagined even still existed on Earth. Humbled by the imposing natural landscapes here, you will not want to leave. And this is just a sliver of what makes this land so spectacular. There are still rivers to raft, penguins to see, whales to watch, sea lions to snorkel with, shipwrecks to explore, the Beagle Channel to scuba, and heli-skiiing to do. And that’s just on the Argentine side of Patagonia…Chilean Patagionia also awaits. Time to start planning.Want more Thrillist?

Patagonia Cabins, just east of Grand Marais, is located along one of the more remote parts of the shore, which means it’s an ideal spot for an escape for two.

How to see the Ruta de los 7 Lagos

There are two main ways to go about seeing the lakes: booking a tour & car rental. I opted for the car rental route.

I used Rucaco Rental Cars, as it is in the center of Bariloche. However, there are certainly other car rental options around town.

Rucaco whatsapp number: +54 9 2944 89 8934

If you want to rent a car, you’ll need to show your passport, driver’s license, and a valid credit card. You can still pay in cash at the counter, but you’ll need to show a credit card for security. The cost was 12,000 pesos per day ($40).

Each ‘day’ is a 24-hour period; you’ll need to drop off the car the following day at the same time. You’ll also need to return the car with a full gas tank. There are several around Bariloche, so this shouldn’t present a problem. Also, gas tends to be more affordable in Patagonia than in the rest of the country.

I picked the car up at 2 pm on the first day, and dropped it off at 2 pm on the last day.

The benefit of renting a car is that you can make as many stops as you want, for as long as possible. A tour will stop only at the official 7 lakes, and Cascada Villugnanco, and for only several minutes at each stop.

If you’re feeling more adventurous, there is also the possibility to rent a bike and ride several kilometers along this route as well.

How Long Do You Need?

If you drive from Bariloche directly to San Martin de los Andes with no stops, it will take just over 3 hours. Therefore, a round trip will take 6 hours without stopping. Add a few more hours for stops. Add an hour for lunch. Technically, you could do this in one day. But do you really want a 10-hour day of rushing to fit everything in? My answer to that question was a resounding NO. But if you don’t mind the long day, if you’re crunched for time, or you only want to rent a car for half a day, then it is certainly possible.

Needless to say, there are several options for arranging your time around this adventure; I chose to rent a car for 48 hours, over the course of 3 days.

Day 1:

I, along with 2 friends, picked the car up at 2pm in Bariloche. We then made our way up north, making stops at Villa La Angostura, Lago Nahuel Huapi viewpoints, Mirador Inalco, Playa Lago Espejo, and Lago Correntoso. Then we headed directly to San Martin de los Andes to check into our accommodation and go to dinner.

Day 2:

Our second day was dedicated to seeing the area around San Martin de los Andes. We hiked at Cerro Colorado, cooled off at Playa Yuco, and had dinner at a hip indoor food market back in San Martin.

Day 3:

We got up early to head back south; we stopped at all the places we missed on the way up: Lago Machónico, Lago Hermoso, Cascada Villugnanco, Lago Falkner, Lago Villarino, Lago Escondido, Lago Espejo Chico, and a quick stop at Puerto La Angostura. We made it back to Bariloche just in time to drop off the car again by 2pm.

Personally, this amount of time worked for me. I saw what I wanted to see. If you aren’t interested in the area around San Martin de los Andes, you can easily complete the route in two days: one day up, one night in San Martin, and one day down. I stayed just outside of San Martin in a shared cabin.

If you have more time and want to see more, of course, your itinerary can be easily expanded. There are campsites all along the route of the seven lakes. You can also spend time north of San Martin de los Andes visiting other lakes, such as Lago Lolog and the town of Junin de los Andes.

What’s the best time to go?

The answer to this question depends entirely on what you want to see. It is beautiful all year, but it changes dramatically depending on the season. The high seasons for the area are winter and summer. Regardless of the season, however, I suggest booking your accommodations in advance. Try filtering for the ‘pay when you arrive’ option so that you can pay in cash.

The 4 Seasons Breakdown

In Argentina’s winter (July and August), there will be snow. This area is famous for skiing, and you’ll see several ski resorts along the route, and just outside Bariloche. Lots of people come to the area in these months for winter sports. You should take more precautions and drive slower in this time period. However, snow-covered lakes are also stunning.

In Argentina’s summer (January and February), you’ll find the most tourists. Of course, seeing the surrounding nature will be stunning, though you might run into more cars on the road and more people at all the stops. The weather will also be much warmer, so you can take advantage of the heat and jump into the lakes to cool off.

Shoulder seasons are generally the best time to travel, especially in Argentina. You’ll find fewer people and more affordable prices.

Fall in Argentina (March, April, and May) is a nice time to visit, but the weather will definitely be getting cooler down south. However, you will also be treated to amazing colors as the leaves begin to change.

Spring in Argentina (November and December) is a perfect time to visit the area. It’s warm during the day, but chilly at night. There are fewer people around, and prices have not yet soared for accommodation. The lakes are beautiful as ever. If you like old classic cars, you may consider planning your trip around the 1000 Millas; This occurs every spring and is a classic car race of 1000 miles around Patagonia. I’m not so into cars, but it was very cool to see all the old cars passing us by along the route.

Where should I stay in San Martin de los Andes?

There are a ton of places to stay in the area. I stayed just outside of town in an A-framed cabin with a shared kitchen. It was very cozy and quiet.

There are also very nice cabins and hotels with a waterfront view such as:

Cabañas Lago Soñado de los Andes

Puerto Lacar Lodge SMARG

Cabaña frente al lago

A very popular hostel (breakfast included) is the Alhue Patagonia Hostel. This is where my friend stayed, and enjoyed it.

Is this trip worth it?

Yes, 100 times yes. Patagonia is incredibly beautiful, but the ruta de los 7 lagos is one step up. Every view will astound you, every lake will take your breath away, and you’ll be overwhelmed by the number of photos you’ll have by the end. I spent two weeks around Bariloche, and driving the route of the seven lakes was easily one of my favorite activities. Whenever you decide to take this trip, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.

https://www.outsideonline.com/?p=2625942,How Kristine Tompkins Helped Conserve 15 Million Acres in Patagonia,"In the early 1990s, Kristine McDivitt, then the CEO of Patagonia, was at a café in El Calafate, Argentina, when a man named Doug Tompkins sat down next to her. “Hey, kid, how ya doing?” he asked. Doug was the best friend and climbing buddy of her boss, Yvon Chouinard, and he was known as a brilliant, arrogant bon vivant. In 1964, Doug had cofounded the North Face with his first wife, Susie Tompkins Buell. Seven years later, the two started another clothing company, Esprit. After cashing out, he moved to Chile to live alone in a small cabin.

Kristine, a free-spirited California girl who had worked her way up the ladder at Patagonia after an entry-level, two-dollar-an-hour “assistant packing” job in her teens, knew Doug’s reputation. So when he tried to convince her to stay in South America with him, she demurred. (She also happened to be engaged to another man at the time.) But he was persistent. Months later, a five-day visit to Chile to see the farm Doug had purchased at the edge of a fjord turned into five weeks. Finally, Kristine returned to the States, “blew up her personal life,” and never looked back—by 1993 she had quit her job, married Doug, and moved into his cabin.

For the next two decades, the pair lived between remote homes in Chile and Argentina, only occasionally returning to California. They had a grand plan: buy and protect as much land threatened by logging and overgrazing as possible. Eventually, through a series of nonprofits run by the Tompkinses, the couple purchased hundreds of thousands of acres from ranchers and absentee landowners. Their fairy-tale life ended in tragedy in 2015, when Doug died in a kayaking accident in Chile at 72. Wracked with grief, Kristine was left alone at the helm of Tompkins Conservation, which was on the cusp of making the largest private land donation in history, to take the form of numerous national parks granted to the governments of Chile and Argentina.

Who better to capture this epic saga of love and loss on film than the Oscar-winning couple of Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin? Their new documentary, Wild Life, follows Kristine Tompkins’s trajectory from barefoot Southern California girl to CEO of one of the most influential outdoor brands in the country to champion of conservation. The film will debut in select theaters starting April 14 and will be available to stream on May 26 on Disney+.

Chin met the Tompkinses through Chouinard and Rick Ridgeway, a climber and former Patagonia vice president. “Doug, Yvon, and Rick have all been heroes to me since I started out as a young dirtbag climber and photographer living in Yosemite,” Chin said in an email. And after spending time with Kristine, he “quickly learned that she is a force of nature, an incredible human being. So of course, taking on this film was something deeply personal to me.”

Before Doug died, Chin had visited the couple in South America and shot footage of them, noodling on the notion of making a film. After the kayaking accident, he and Vasarhelyi approached Kristine about putting together a movie of her life. “It took me a while to think that a film like this should be made,” said Kristine, adding that she only gave her approval because she thought it would be good for encouraging conservation efforts. “I decided if I was going to do it, I would do it only with Jimmy and Chai. They are extraordinary filmmakers and trusted friends.”

Wild Life delves into the Tompkinses’ years of joy and struggle and the aftermath of the tragedy, as told through intimate interviews with Kristine and a close circle of lifelong companions. Chin’s signature stunning photography of Chile and Argentina is intercut with 1960s footage of America’s original climbing, skiing, and surfing dirtbag royalty: Kristine singing the Beach Boys’ “California Girls”; the Grateful Dead playing at the opening of the first North Face store; Chouinard, Doug, and their funhog crew unfurling a flag after their historic ascent of Fitz Roy. The clips add levity and also bring into focus that, even before they were a couple, the Tompkinses were fundamental players in the creation myth of modern American outdoor culture.

It’s clear that Doug and Kristine were soulmates. Yet they were also intense overachievers committed to conservation work in countries that were often suspicious of and hostile toward their efforts—some Chileans, for example, thought that the couple’s real aim was to populate their land with American bison. The pair rarely had time to explore together. In the film, Kristine sets out to climb a 7,500-foot peak in Patagonia’s Chacabuco Valley that her husband and Chouinard first summited in 2009. Doug dubbed the peak Cerro Kristine. Chouinard and Ridgeway—both were on the kayaking expedition that killed Doug—accompany Kristine on her journey to reach the summit, along with Chin and professional rock climber Timmy O’Neill. “Why did we never climb our mountain together?” Kristine asks the clouds as she stands alone, looking out over Patagonia National Park.

The documentary is a testament to fierce love and how its power can serve a greater purpose. “There was a deep, deep union and devotion to each other, and they came together with a common vision,” says friend and filmmaker Edgar Boyle in Wild Life. But the grief that resulted when that union was severed by tragedy is difficult to watch. At one point, Kristine recounts, while flying with Doug’s remains to his final resting place near their home in the Chacabuco Valley, she carved their names in the coffin with a small knife. “Doug’s death was an amputation,” Kristine told me. “I took some long walks by myself and was never sure I’d turn around and walk back.”

The only way forward was to dive even further into her conservation work. With the help of a roughly 300-person staff at Tompkins Conservation, she exceeded her late husband’s dream of creating 12 national parks. The current count: 15, along with two marine parks and a total of 14.8 million protected acres in Chile and Argentina—an area roughly the size of West Virginia. Those numbers keep expanding, along with Kristine’s seemingly endless supply of energy to continue the work she started with her husband. “I carry Doug around in my pocket. If I get really stuck on something, I simply ask: ‘What would you do?’ I am just grateful that we have this marriage,” she said, still speaking of their union in the present tense. “It’s given me unbelievable strength.”

Kristine is still the president of Tompkins Conservation, but she has relinquished day-to-day operations to focus primarily on strategy. In late February, she met with Chilean president Gabriel Boric to move forward with a proposed donation of 230,000 acres on behalf of Tompkins Conservation, with a view toward creating national park number 16 at Cape Froward, on the Brunswick Peninsula, the southernmost point of the continent. The rugged, largely unexplored region is a refuge for endangered species like the huemul deer.

“I want people to realize that this film is not about Doug and Kristine,” she told me. “It’s the representation of hundreds of Chileans’ and Argentines’ work. Mother Nature is not winning this game. We are all on the losing team, and everybody needs to join the fight.”",[],2023-04-12 11:00:35+00:00
https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/wild-life-movie-review-2023,Wild Life movie review & film summary (2023),"The documentary is told with humbled awe by one of their friends, Jimmy Chin, who co-directs this film with long-time collaborator and wife Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi. We know that Chin is close with them as he appears early on-camera in the movie, taking a hike with Kris through the land at stake and which holds great, humbling beauty as either a backdrop or the subject of a drone shot. Chin did a similar hike with Doug before he passed in 2015. It becomes fitting how the movie, shot over five years, is loosely framed around this excursion that Chin did with Kris and their other friends (there's even some geeky gear talk before they begin, for good measure). While it has a personal touch of a love letter, this documentary is nonetheless the work of compassionate filmmakers who know any adventure when they see one.

Though it has far less threat of vertigo as with their Oscar-winning documentary “Free Solo,” thrill-seeking documentarians Chin and Vasarhelyi share this story with their usual care and smart calculation. It’s just as much a survival adventure, but it's that of the planet. And it’s still about risk takers out in the world, as Douglas and Kris worked to purchase millions of acres of land in Chile to turn them into national parks and to save them from being mined or destroyed. The film covers a good deal of territory, all in 93 minutes. It’s a steady stroll, with some more contemplative passages than others, but Chin and Vasarhelyi keep the pace.

Chin and Vasarhelyi have a first-name familiarity with their subjects that goes deeper than a typical director-subject relationship, but they also seem to know Doug and Kris by their pet names, Lolo and Birdy. In the film's sweetest sequences, we learn about their massive affection for each other and how Doug courted Kris when they were both deep into their business ventures and not yet philanthropists. Kris shares these stories with a glint in her eye, and Chin and Vasarhelyi accompany these moments with their personal messages to each other.","['Nick Allen', 'Simon Abrams', 'Brian Tallerico', 'Glenn Kenny', 'Katie Rife', 'Matt Zoller Seitz', 'Christy Lemire', 'Odie Henderson', ""Sheila O'Malley""]",

Adrenaline junkies, it’s time to get stoked for the 16th annual 5Point Film Festival returning to Carbondale Wednesday, April 19, through Sunday, April 23.

“From a programming perspective, the bar is so high, and adventure filmmakers are producing really high-quality projects,” said head of programming Charlie Turnbull. “Ever since ‘Free Solo’ won the Oscar, the genre has become very in vogue. It’s also spurred a lot of our filmmakers to tell more human-interest stories that have a backdrop of adventure and the outdoors.”

5Point head of programming Charlie Turnbull has worked to evolve the festival into a cultural and community event.

The festival will present 40 films, including 15 world premieres and 10 Colorado premieres.

Making its regional debut is the latest film from Oscar-winning filmmakers Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, “Wild Life,” which follows conservationist Kris Tompkins on a decades-spanning love story.

After meeting her husband, outdoorsman, and entrepreneur Doug Tomkins, she and he left behind successful careers in the brands they helped pioneer — Patagonia, The North Face, and Esprit — to create national parks throughout Chile and Argentina via their non-profit Tompkins Conservation. The film, part of a pre-screening earlier this weekend, follows the highs and lows of those efforts.

“Jimmy Chin and Chai Vasarhelyi’s new feature film about Kris Tompkins is great. It’s just a really beautiful love story slash conservation story that will blow audiences away,” said Turnbull.

Another film making its Colorado premiere is pertinent to what’s happening with the re-introduction of wolves into Colorado: “Range Rider.”

The film introduces us to Daniel Curry, a range rider whose job is to patrol wild areas on horseback, creating a buffer between wolves and cattle herds that graze on public lands. The film focuses on Washington State and the complicated issues that arise in rural ranching areas with re-introduction and asks if co-existence between ranchers and wolves is possible. The film is directed by Colin Arisman, with cinematography by Carbondale local Oliver Sutro.

“I’m really excited about the Colorado premiere of ‘Range Rider.’ ACES is supporting that screening, and I know it’s super topical here at the moment,” said Turnbull.

New Castle considers building water park

With about 400 submissions from filmmakers from the United States, Canada, and Europe, Turnbull said, it was tough to narrow it down to only 40 films. He said the key to programming the festival is to keep the audience “on their toes” with a mix of hardcore adventure, personal storytelling, and some films that are just light and funny.

Audiences will also find a mix of outdoor sports from cycling, climbing, and skiing to paddling, running, and more.

5Point has added several free events throughout the five days, including a special screening of “Resistance Climbing,” a film about a group of climbers in conflict-torn Palestine.

According to Turnbull, beyond the film programming, 5Point is expanding its footprint throughout the week with new cultural offerings for attendees and the community.

For the first time, it will offer a curated music lineup that complements the nightly film programs, featuring Denver rock band iZCALLi, Brothers of Brass, and a one-night-only reunion performance of local yacht rock band The Davenports. All the musical performances are free.

The festival also will present live comedy night as part of the festival at the Black Nugget, featuring comedians Salma Zaky, Gabby Gutierrez-Reed, and Sammy Anzer, hosted by Denver comedian Eeland Stribling.

Another new addition, in partnership with Independence Run and Hike and ValleyOrtho, is the first 5K on Saturday, April 22, at 9-10 a.m. The race starts and ends at Independence Run and Hike, $25 per entry, free for VIP pass holders.

“We wanted to be a bit ambitious and to try and grow it into something that was more than just films, particularly with those free events,” Turnbull said. “We see it as a good way to cultivate community around this event and to build it into a festival where there really is something for everyone. Obviously, the films will always be our core kind of draw and programming component, but it’s really cool to have music and comedy and especially the 5k Saturday kind of opportunity for the community to come and enjoy something for free mingle with the filmmakers.”

For him, programming the festival and being part of the community is a dream come true. An Australian, he said he hadn’t heard of 5Points until 2018, when he came to the festival supporting his film “Bikes of Wrath,” which follows five Aussie friends as they attempt to cycle from Oklahoma to California in honor of John Steinbeck’s classic novel “The Grapes of Wrath,” following the same route as American farmers during the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s.

He was so impressed by the experience and the community of Carbondale that when the opportunity came up in 2020 to program the festival, he jumped at the chance.

“It’s such a special and unique festival because everything and everyone is in one place,” he said. “There’s no competing screenings in different locations, which a lot of film festivals have. There are 800 people that come together, and the energy inside the rec center is really unique and hard to beat. It’s an intoxicating experience that (founder) Julie Kennedy created long before we did, but we hope we’ve still got it.”

More and more people are taking steps to become a conscious consumer, aka someone who seeks to make positive environmental, economic, and social changes with their purchases.

Across social media, the concept of conscious consumerism is becoming more popular, with the viral ""deinfluencing"" TikTok trend only exacerbating its growth. The ""deinfluencing"" hashtag on TikTok has millions of views, showing that there is definitely an interest in being more of a conscious consumer. Notably, the deinfluencing movement began as a response to overconsumption by influencers but has since morphed into more of a ""buy this, not that"" challenge, once again promoting overconsumption. Still, there is hope that things are changing, with huge companies taking steps toward attracting the more conscious consumer. For example, Levi's is actively trying to use sustainably sourced cotton as well as less water to create their iconic jeans, whereas Patagonia offers a repair program for their products and promotes purchasing Patagonia items secondhand.

Here are five ways you can become a more conscious consumer and do your bit for the planet, no matter the financial situation you're in.

Start By Thinking About What You Already Own

© Maddie Red/Shutterstock Hermes storefront

The first (and easiest) way to become a conscious consumer is to limit the amount of things you actually buy. We're all guilty of seeing the latest trends pop up on our Instagram feed or TikTok FYP and putting things in our basket — only for them to arrive, and the realization hits that you have nothing to style your new clothes with.

Of course, this doesn't include items that you actually need to replace, like a mascara you use every day or a top that has fallen apart from being worn many, many times. Instead, this change focuses on items that you see and feel the need to buy, despite knowing deep down that you don't actually need them. This idea also ties in with the idea of a ""no spend month,"" a search term that is blowing up on TikTok and is exactly what it sounds like — a month where you buy nothing except exactly what you need. Once you start prioritizing need over want, you'll find your non-essential purchases will slowly begin to minimize themselves.

Always Do Your Own Research On A Brand

In line with the above, if you do need to replace something like a T-shirt, don't just go out and buy the first one you see. Take your time to research the brand you're considering buying from and the materials used for the item to determine if it's a quality piece.

Sustainability and ethics rating website Good On You is a solid place to begin, as it has a wide catalog of brands and lists in detail the areas where they excel and where they are lacking. An important thing to keep in mind is that sustainable clothing is often more expensive, meaning it isn't in-budget for many. If this is the case for you, keep in mind that one purchase from a less sustainable brand won't cause irreparable damage to the planet — it's excessive buying and overconsumption that has a negative impact on the planet.

In line with the above tip, once you've chosen your item, think about how many items in your current wardrobe it will match with. You may like a top, but if you have to buy other items to pair with it, it probably isn't what your wardrobe needs.

Reducing Temptation Will Help You To Think More Consciously

As mentioned above, being influenced to buy an item is one of the main obstacles when it comes to being a conscious consumer. We've all mindlessly scrolled when bored and stumbled across a deal that catches our eye, and the same goes for email newsletters. When you receive an email telling you about a special event or limited-time discount, the adrenaline rush can make you forget to think about your purchases mindfully.

Sales are an excellent time to purchase items you've been needing to buy for a while, but they can also be an enemy to someone trying to become a conscious consumer. Unsubscribing to newsletters will help to curb some of your impulse buying, as you won't be so aware of flash sales happening at any given time.

This also goes for returning items when you've changed your mind about an impulse buy. Often, companies send returned clothes to landfill, which produces a shocking annual 27 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. By only buying items that fit your current wardrobe, you'll be actively helping the environment without needing to spend any money.

Choosing To Go Secondhand Can Make A Big Difference

© Kmpzzz/Shutterstock Woman thrifting clothes

Another excellent way to do your bit for the environment is by thrifting or buying secondhand. Thrifting was trendy in 2023, with the TikTok hashtag ""#thrifthaul"" garnering billions of views. As well as going to a physical thrift store, there are several online thrift shops to choose from, such as Thredup for regular items and TheRealReal for luxury goods.

There's no doubt that shopping secondhand can have a hugely positive environmental impact. There are also thrifting hacks for the best chance of finding higher-quality clothes. Not only are you preventing items from going to landfill, but secondhand items are usually cheaper, so thrifting is also a great option if you're on a budget.

Despite this positive impact, it's important that you only thrift what you need. A lot of thrifters can't stand Depop sellers and those who sell on other platforms like Poshmark, as they often thrift items they have no intention to wear and then resell them for a much higher price. Moreover, most clothes found in thrift stores are from fast fashion brands, caused by the rise in micro trends and the desire people have to keep up with the ever-changing next big thing in fashion. While thrifting is a good, measured alternative to shopping fast fashion firsthand, it can quickly become unsustainable if you buy more than you need.

Consider Where You Buy Your Groceries

© Look Studio/Shutterstock Woman grocery shopping

You can reduce your footprint and become a conscious consumer in more ways than changing up where you shop for clothes. Nikki Vargas, the editor-in-chief of feminist travel publication Unearth Women, told The New York Times that she recommends keeping things local. While Vargas was referring to shopping locally when traveling, the same thing applies to everyday life. Some farmers' markets and small local shops have better deals than your nearest large grocery store, and the smaller selection will force you to think about what you consciously need.

Once again, the concept of only buying what you need comes into play here. If you see that radishes are on sale, stocking up on them may seem like a good deal. However, buying more than you need leads to food waste, which in turn leads to the waste being sent to landfill and releasing greenhouse gas emissions that are harmful to the planet.

Buyer’s Guide: How to Choose the Best Climbing Pants

First, take a few moments to imagine your climbing habits. Do you plan to mostly use these pants climbing indoors or in the elements? If outside, will it normally be hot and muggy or cool and breezy? Do you prefer body-hugging clothing or a bit more room?

There’s no right or wrong answer, but having a clear idea of how you’ll use these pants will help determine the best option. For more guidance on choosing the best climbing pants for your needs, keep reading to understand the functions that differentiate them from non-climbing pants.

Climbing Pant Materials

Climbing pants are often a blend of synthetics, sometimes cotton, and typically elastane (sometimes called spandex). The higher percentage of elastane, the more stretch the pants will have.

The added stretch will also result in a more skintight feel, much like the Cotopaxi Cerro Tight with its impressive stretch capabilities (21% elastane).

It’s not only the amount of elastane that makes climbing pants outperform regular pants. Other essential factors include breathability, reinforced areas that add durability, and design that allows fluid mobility, like the Patagonia Altvia Alpine Pants. A decent amount of stretch allows climbers to high-step, stem, and heel hook without restriction.

Other factors, like moisture-wicking properties, sun protection, and the ability to dry quickly, are not vital for indoor climbing. However, they are necessary for long, strenuous alpine or multi-pitch climbs.

Fit

There are a few things to consider when finding the right fit for climbing pants. A loose-fitting pant provides a comfortable, relaxed feel designed for maximum movement. However, the material often tends to be heavier.

If the pants are too loose and flowy, they can obscure your vision for when you need to hone in on technical footwork. On the other hand, tight-fitting pants like leggings and tights allow total freedom without feeling weighed down.

The downside to a tight fit is less durability against abrasions. Tight, thin leggings don’t provide as much buffer between your skin and the rock.

Pockets

Insufficient pockets, or the complete lack thereof, tend to make it on our cons list more than other features on climbing pants. The pockets that tend to work the best are ones that don't interfere with a harness, are deep enough to be useful, and provide a zipper to ensure that your stuff stays in place while you’re climbing.

A standout in our line of pants is the Patagonia Altvia Alpine Pants. These pants offer zipped flat pockets that don't interfere with a harness. We also love that the Arc’teryx Gamma Pants only feature zip pockets, ideal for getting high off the ground. If you find yourself climbing indoors or at a local single-pitch crag, you'll be able to get away with climbing pants that offer a more basic pocket design.

© Provided by GearJunkie Every pocket on the Every pocket on the Arc’teryx Gamma pant is protected by a zipper, meaning you won’t lose anything as you pull the move; (photo/Greg Petliski)

Weight

Generally speaking, the more technical the pant, the more they will weigh because of features that allow them to withstand various elements and terrain. The Patagonia Caliza Rock Pant, for instance, weighs 12 ounces and has several features that make it a durable pant for everyday climbing.

The known lightest on our list is the Patagonia Chambeau Rock Pants, weighing only 7.9 ounces. This pant is breathable and lightweight - perfect for warm-weather excursions.

Weather Protection

Some climbing pants are treated with a DWR (Durable Water Repellent) coating. This water-resistant coating helps you stay dry by preventing light precipitation from saturating the fabric. While the DWR won't protect you from a heavy downpour, it will keep light rain beading off the pants and allow them to dry quickly.

Several pants in our lineup have a DWR finish, including the Topo Designs Boulder Pants and the Arc’teryx Gamma Pants. This feature is specifically helpful for those conducting long alpine ascents and who may find themselves in unpredictable weather.

It's important to note special instructions to care for your DWR-treated pants to make the coating last longer. Dirt and oils can impede the coating's moisture-repelling ability, and frequent washing can help maintain its water-repellency.

Thickness and Durability

Beyond choosing a silhouette that complements one’s ergonomics, an important component of a pair of pants are that they are durable. They’ll need to withstand walks through abrasive brush, scrambles up and down steep spur trails, grinding against granite, and rubbing against rough sandstone.

For long-lasting pants, look for thicker fabric, an anti-abrasive or abrasive-resistant overlay or material, and reinforced high-wear areas like the knees.

Climbing pants that received our high praise for durability are the Patagonia Caliza Rock Pants and the Arc’teryx Gamma Pants. They withstood beatings against rock and off-trail travel. Although pants designed for rugged use tend to be warmer, so keep that in mind if you climb in hot temperatures.

Articulated Knees and Gussets

A climbing pant's ability to stretch extensively makes them different from slacks and most everyday jeans. Beyond elastane material, climbing pants are designed to extend the range of motion by having articulated knees and gussets. The gusseted crotch and four-way stretch of the Topo Designs Boulder Pants makes high stepping a breeze.

Pants with articulated knees will provide the same natural range of motion as a knee while walking and bending. These features are helpful, especially on pants with less elastane that need a boost in flexibility. As for gussets, the diamond-shaped piece of extra fabric sewn in the crotch area make pants more breathable and allows more freedom to move.

FAQ

What Are the Best Climbing Pants? The best climbing pants are the ones that make you feel comfortable and allow you to move freely. Our best overall pant is the Patagonia Caliza Pant because they are not overly loose or too tight. They also have a wide elastic waist that's perfect for a harness and adjustable ankles that can go higher or lower based on preference. Comfort, style, and practicality make these pants excellent for climbing. Do I Need Climbing Pants? It depends. If you are brand new to climbing and testing the sport out for the first time, consider using what you already own - attire you would typically wear to work out. Once you have established that climbing is something you wish to pursue, investing in climbing pants can provide you with unique benefits. Pant attributes like wide elastic waistbands designed for harnesses, pockets placed for easy access, cuffs that cinch above climbing shoes, and extra material stretch for movement are great assets when climbing regularly. Can I Wear Climbing Pants for Hiking? Most climbing pants offer a range of features that make them multipurpose pants - ideal for walking, hiking, and backpacking. Elements of climbing pants that can apply to hiking are sun protection, DWR, abrasion-resistant material, and functional pockets. A favorite of ours is the Outdoor Research Ferrosi Pants; their breathable fabric and high UPF rating makes them a great option for hiking. You'll find us wearing most of the pants on this list beyond rock climbing at the gym and crag. Is It Better To Climb In Pants or Shorts? This can depend on the style of climbing and rock type. When climbing on coarse granite, like the rock found in Joshua Tree or Vedavoo, many climbers prefer to wear pants over shorts, even when it's hot out. If the style of climbing requires sticking your legs in wide cracks or chimney moves, pants will protect you from scraping your knees. For sport climbing or bouldering that requires less full-body contact with the rock, shorts can be fine in hot weather. Ultimately this is a personal preference, and you'll figure out what you like the more you climb in different areas and conditions.

If you're struggling, here's a hint: it's not in the water.

Can you track down the elusive big cat?

Have you found the big cat in this picture from Patagonia? Here's a hint: the puma's not in the water

As this is a hard one, here's a zoomed-in picture. Can you see the big cat now?

Male pumas can grow to 2.4metres in the wild and weigh an average of 62kg. Females are shorter and weigh around 42kg.

Pumas living near the Equator are smaller than those living further north or south.

The big cats are solitary and can travel more than six miles every night in search of their prey, making it even harder to track them down.

You'll have to get up early or stay up into the night to catch a glimpse of one, as they are most active at dawn and dusk and during the night.

He embodies the purpose of the LionHeart award and we are humbled to be able to offer the platform of Cannes Lions to appeal to the world’s communicators to help his cause. His work is an inspiration to us all and we look forward to honouring him in June.”

Previous recipients of the Cannes LionHeart include Bono, Al Gore, Blake Mycoskie, Richard Curtis, Paul Polman, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka and Malala Yousafzai.

On receiving the award, Yvon Chouinard said, “50 years ago, we started this experiment in responsible business, and today, as we look towards the next 50, we’re dead serious about addressing the environmental crisis. Every part of the Patagonia business, including the value we create, is linked to our purpose. We have a long history of asking customers to think differently about the clothes they wear, buying only what they need and repairing when necessary. And as a company, we give away 1% of sales each year and are a certified B Corporation. But none of this is enough. That’s why we decided it’s time for a new experiment, with the announcement that earth is now our only shareholder.

“Receiving the recognition of the LionHeart award sends the message that creativity can be a powerful force in the work to save our home planet. The creative industry is uniquely placed to lead the way in ambitious business practices and to inspire people everywhere to act now.”

Tyler LaMotte, Marketing Director, EMEA, Patagonia, will represent the brand on stage at Cannes Lions in a highly anticipated seminar. LaMotte said, “For our 50th year, we’re looking forward, not back, to life on Earth. Together, we can prioritize purpose over profit and protect this wondrous planet, our only home.” For the first time, the Cannes LionHeart seminar will dive into the marketing practitioners point of view and demonstrate how to drive the sustainability agenda in practice not theory, and how to prioritise purpose over profit.

Chouinard founded Patagonia in 1973, a company known for its quality products and commitment to advancing solutions to the environmental crisis. The company was nearly 50 when Chouinard decided it was time for another improvement. In September 2022, Chouinard and his family adopted an innovative ownership model, locking in the company’s values and dedicating the excess profits to protecting our home planet.

Chouinard cofounded 1% for the Planet, Textile Exchange, Fair Labor Association, Sustainable

Apparel Coalition, The Conservation Alliance, the Regenerative Organic Alliance, and the

Global Salmon Farming Resistance. Chouinard‘s business memoir Let My People Go Surfing has been published in 16 languages and has sold more than 500,000 copies. His book The Responsible Company tells how to incorporate values in business.

5th Wednesday, January 2022 - 10:07 UTC Full article

The incident began last Saturday, making it necessary to evacuate the town of Puerto Pirámides

About 80,000 hectares of Argentine Patagonia came under fire during the weekend and the smoke has even reached the city of La Plata, a little over 1,000 kilometers northeast of the epicenter in the Puerto Madryn region, in the province of Chubut.

Some 226 firefighters were deployed, in addition to nine planes, eight helicopters, six lorries and other equipment to put down the flames.

The incident began last Saturday down National Route 3, making it necessary to evacuate the town of Puerto Pirámides.

The Argentine Ministry of the Environment has reported there were still two active focus in Chubut, one in the department of Biedma, and the other in the department of Tehuelches, although the latter was said to be under control.

In addition to firefighters, hundreds of people, many of them volunteers from the towns affected and from others not far off, have joined the efforts alongside Civil Defense, National and Provincial Roads, and the provincial Ministry of Security.

At the request of the province of Chubut, the National Government sent 2 hydrant planes to fight the fire in the Puerto Madryn area.

The federal Government also wired AR $ 368 million (US $ 3.5 million at the official exchange rate) to the National Fire Management Fund to cover the expenses of operations in Patagonia.

Smoke from the forest fire in has been detected in the Greater Buenos Aires area, particularly in the provincial capital: La Plata, according to the local newspaper El Día, which also explained the situation was due to the strength and direction of winds coming from Patagonia.

In the sky of La Plata you can see its particles, in addition to its smell, El Día said. The newspaper also updated the Ministry of Environment and said there were no active foci by Tuesday.

It was a fire that has had an extreme behavior from the beginning and I estimate that the flames consumed between 80,000 and 90,000 hectares of natural forest, Civil Defense Director José Mazzei was quoted by El Día as saying. There is a lot of dust in suspension, but no active smoke columns are seen, since the wind conditions and the change of fuel that the fire had, caused it to subside, but we are going to have to evaluate it with an overflight, he added.

This morning we do not see active sources, but we have to continue working in the area ...  so that there is not much flammable around in case fire reignites, according to Deputy Puerto Madryn Firefighters Chief Ricardo Saavedra.",[],2022-01-05 00:00:00
https://travel.usnews.com/features/4-reasons-to-visit-patagonia-in-the-off-season,4 Reasons to Visit Patagonia in the Off-Season,"Patagonia, the wind-whipped region at the southern tip of South America, lures thrill-seekers with its craggy, snow-capped peaks and icy glaciers. As breathtaking as the landscapes are from December to February (summer in the Southern hemisphere), the enchantment of Patagonia can be lost when you're battling thousands of other tourists at popular campsites and along scenic hiking trails. And though summer ushers in pleasant weather and plenty of sunshine, Patagonia shines in the fall and winter, when there are fewer hikers trekking along the most popular trails. So, pack a few extra layers and visit Patagonia's diverse collection of glacial peaks, dramatic mountains and cobalt blue lakes in the off-season.

You'll Battle Fewer Crowds



The biggest draw of visiting Patagonia in the fall or winter is the lack of crowds. Most of the campsites, lodges and hotels are closed from May to September, which instantly cuts into the number of visitors who plan trips at this time of year. But fret not: There are still a few sites that remain open year-round as well as luxury lodges, such as Explora and EcoCamp Patagonia, that remain open throughout the winter. And even though there are fewer lodges that remain open, they rarely are at full occupancy. Explora typically sees 10 to 30 people per week in the off-season, offering a more relaxed and personalized stay. Not only will the lack of tourists make your hikes and treks along the winding trails more peaceful, you'll also enjoy more pristine views and photo ops. Since Patagonia's weather can be unpredictable, make sure to book a guide if you're new to the area so you can navigate the wind, snow or fog with ease.

(Claire Volkman)

You'll Likely Spot More Wildlife

Aside from less tourist traffic, the off-peak months offer higher chances of seeing some of the more elusive wildlife species who call this remote area of South America home. Pumas, foxes, guanacos and nandus decorate the less crowded trails in search of food and shelter during the fall and winter months, which means your hikes might come with a unique sighting or two. In addition to larger mammals, Patagonia is home to an incredible variety of bird species, such as the rare condor and red-legged cormorant, which are likely to be seen in May or June.

You Can Score a Bargain

Due to its remote location, traveling to Patagonia can cost a pretty – especially in the summer months. Trips in the shoulder seasons, early spring and autumn, can help you save on airfare and lodging costs, as well as transportation to and from top attractions. Winter also ushers in cheaper airfares, especially with flights to the smaller airports of Punta Arenas or El Calafate in Argentine Patagonia. Plus, the daily room rates at top lodges like Explora also decrease in the fall and winter, meaning you could upgrade to more luxurious lodgings for less. If you're planning a solo trip, tour groups and guides also provide discounts and freebies for travelers visiting in the shoulder seasons.

https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/its-patagonia-baggies-season-baby/ar-AA19gAkt,"It's Patagonia Baggies Season, Baby!","The sun is out, the cherry blossoms are blossoming, there's an alarming rise in thigh spottings. All of which can only mean one thing (other than allergies): the time to stock up on Patagonia Baggies is nigh.

But first, a little background. Patagonia's swishy “Baggies” shorts are founder Yvon Chouinard's magnum opus, a staple of the brand's catalog for 40 years. What makes the silhouette so enduringly popular? Well, as you might expect from a company with ‘Gonia’s pedigree, they're designed to take on everything from white-water rivers to weekend park hangs, making them go-to shorts for intrepid warm-weather adventurers (and plenty of style-conscious folks trying to jack their swag). And though they were just about flawless out of the gate, last year Patagonia— somehow, inexplicably!—managed to improve them, churning out a subtly-tweaked version crafted entirely from recycled nylon.

Other than going even greener, though, the Patagonia Baggies we know and love are exactly the same—that is, scientifically perfect.

© Provided by GQ [article/slideshow] Patagonia Baggies shorts 5"" $65.00, Patagonia

They're flawless down to the last detail, a pair of shorts so good that, frankly, it's kind of hard for any other brand to top them. Sure, plenty of worthy contenders exist, but there's just no substitute for the real thing. Hopefully, this year's inventory won't fall victim to devastating supply chain issues, but in 2023, all bets are off. For now, though, the shelves are packed with Baggies in all kinds of colors and patterns, ready to swaddle your gloriously unencumbered thighs until next winter.

Whether you're into the Goldilocks five-inchers or need the extra length of the seven-inch long boys, now's the time to go all-in. And at just $65 a pop, there ain't much stopping you from copping a few different colors—unless we stockpile the whole lot first.

The Mapuche RAM group called for the ”freedom (for) the Mapuche Puelche political prisoners and all Mapuche political prisoners of the Walmapu (Mapuche historical territory).

Capitalist winka (white man) out, said the text which also listed the construction company IRSA and entrepreneurs in the area such as UK national Joe Lewis, retired basketballer Manu Ginobili, and the Benetton and Roemmers families, among others. Nawel Wapi is a territory of the Mapuche nation, stated the document under the RAM logo.

Armed resistance for national reconstruction and liberation, continued the document before demanding the release of the machi and all the lamien (sisters), about the seven women arrested in Villa Mascardi who have been charged with arson or other types of damage, assault against authority and usurpation. The men who were occupying the 40-hectare property escaped into the bush and are still at large. It was the eviction that led to Elizabeth Gómez Alcorta's resignation as Women's Minister.

Security Minister Aníbal Fernández said federal forces will remain in the area for an indefinite period of time.”",[],2022-10-15 00:00:00
https://travel.usnews.com/Chilean_Patagonia_Argentina/When_to_Visit/,Best Times To Visit Chilean Patagonia,"Spring is gorgeous. While weather is temperate with daytime highs in the 50s, bring plenty of warm clothing with you. Biting winds and the occasional overcast sky can make it awfully chilly. If you can handle the cool temps, you'll beat the flood of tourists (and pricey accommodation costs) of peak summer months. You'll want to make your reservations at least three months in advance.

November-early March",[],
https://travel.usnews.com/Argentine_Patagonia/Things_To_Do/Southern_Patagonia_62533/,Southern Patagonia Reviews,"Boasting jaw-dropping sights—including Perito Moreno Glacier, Mount Fitz Roy, and Cueva de las Manos—Southern Patagonia attracts culture-hounds and nature-seekers alike. Sitting beneath the Lake District and Atlantic Patagonia at Patagonia's southernmost tip, this rustic district sits to the east of the Chilean border, sprawling downward to the verge of Antarctica.

Most visitors descend upon El Chaltén or El Calafate to experience Patagonia's rugged backcountry. From El Calafate (a remote desert town that serves as the base to journey across Perito Moreno Glacier), you can relish the towering ice fields and far-stretching verdant forests. Daring hikers trek up jagged peaks and trek across the area's immense ice fields. Near El Calafate lies El Chaltén, a small town neighboring Mount Fitz Roy. From El Calafate, you can take an excursion to survey the Cave of the Hands' ornate and enigmatic cave arts.

The best ways to reach El Calafate and El Chaltén are by plane, bus, or car. A variety of plane services, including LAN and LADE, operate from Buenos Aires and other major Patagonian cities to El Calafate. El Chaltén is just a two-and-a-half-hour drive from El Calafate. For more information on how to reach El Calafate and other sites in Southern Patagonia, consult our guide to Getting Around Argentine Patagonia.",[],
https://travel.usnews.com/Argentine_Patagonia/Things_To_Do/Argentine_Lake_District_62532/,Argentine Lake District Reviews,"Stretching across northwestern tip of Argentine Patagonia sits the picturesque Lake District. Sandwiched between the Andes mountains with Chilean Patagonia to the west and Atlantic Patagonia to the east, the Lake District contains breathtaking vistas from nearly every angle. San Carlos de Bariloche, known simply as Bariloche, serves as the region's major hub. Towering over the immense Nahuel Huapi Lake and the surrounding national park, Bariloche provides a tranquil setting for lounging outdoors, savoring local cuisine, and admiring the picturesque scenery. But Bariloche boasts more than natural beauty. Venture into Bustillo, the heart of the city, and you'll discover European architecture infused with local hardwood accents, which create a lofty urban setting. During July and August, you'll find idyllic skiing conditions, and, in January, you'll relish prime hiking and river rafting weather. We suggest visiting during November or March, when you can soak up the fresh air, marvel at postcard-perfect views of the Andes, and relax at a tucked away mountain retreat without heavy crowds.

From Bariloche, it's easy to travel to Cerro Catedral's luxurious ski retreat. It's also worth checking out Villa La Angostura (a lakeside village 50 miles north of Bariloche) and San Martín de los Andes (a scenic town 112 miles north of Bariloche). Both feature local craft markets and panoramic views.

You can reach the Lake District via plane, bus, or car. Aerolíneas Argentinas and LADE airlines offer direct flights to and from Buenos Aires to Bariloche as well as other lakeside cities. A variety of bus services offer rides from Bariloche to Atlantic Patagonia's Puerto Madryn and Trelew (located about 14 hours away) and Southern Patagonia's El Chaltén and El Calafate (located about 21 hours away).

https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/flip-flops-traveled-everywhere-patagonia-020000439.html,These Flip-flops Have Traveled With Me Everywhere From Patagonia to Portugal — and They’re Only $6,"Dotdash Meredith and Yahoo Inc. may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

My waterproof Havaianas come in handy from the beach to the sauna to the shower and beyond.

Travel + Leisure / Tyler Roeland

Despite the fact that I’ve been writing about travel for the past decade and am on the road at least half the month, I struggle packing for most trips. It’s not the clothing I’m overthinking — it’s the shoes. I run through every possible scenario and occasion — will there be a hike? Sauna? A last-minute beach party with the most stylish people in town? And I stare at my shoe collection, wondering how I’ll fit everything into my carry-on. But there is one pair of shoes I know will be in the front pocket of my suitcase for every trip: my Havaianas Slim Fresh Flip-Flop sandals.

Growing up in South Florida, flip-flops were as essential as sunscreen (my first job was even at a PacSun, so I’m well versed in all the surf sandals). Now that I’m living in Paris making a living travel writing, I’ve tested all the popular brands and have splurged on the designer rubber sandals du jour, but I keep coming back to the same style of slim Havaianas. They come in handy for the beach, spa, shower, and beyond — and they’re up to 58 percent off at Amazon right now in select colors.

Amazon

To buy: amazon.com, $6 (originally $23)



The 100 percent rubber sandal is synonymous with Brazil — where it’s been made since the 1960s — and is known for its simple, rice-patterned sole (a nod to the first design inspired by thin, Japanese zori rice straw sandals) that’s super grippy on most any surface. I’ve found these sturdy waterproof sandals are lightweight enough to throw into any travel or beach bag (they weigh a mere 5 ounces) and hardly take up any in my overnight bag or carry-on.

Of course they’re my number one beach pick, but I’ve been surprised to see just how versatile these sandals are. When I spent 21 days on a cruise to Antarctica, I wore these around the ship every day. When I was island hopping around Greece last summer, I donned these on the ferry and poolside at resorts. They’ve gone with me paddle boarding around Portugal’s Algarve region, on expeditions in Patagonia, to safari lodges in South Africa, and hammams in Istanbul.

Story continues

Travel + Leisure / Lane Nieset

These flip-flops feature a super-soft cushioned insole and non-slip tread, and the brand is also known for their vibrant, poppy patterns. Amazon has them in more than 50 colors from women’s size 4-12. I alternate between a neutral shade like black and a pastel, rainforest print that surprisingly goes with everything — patterned dresses, jumpsuits, gym clothes, you name it.

Amazon

To buy: amazon.com, $34



It’s no wonder more than 15,000 Amazon reviewers have given the sandals five-star ratings. One shopper declared these are “the gold standard for flip-flops.” Another customer added that “living in a year-round sunny climate, I almost wear no other shoes,” and “these are the most supportive flip-flops I’ve found.”

Some flip-flops take some breaking in before they’re comfortable, but Havaianas instantly feel like they’re molded to your feet. “Love wearing these,” wrote one reviewer. “Took the dog on a half-hour walk and no blisters or discomfort,” concluding that they’re the “best flip-flops ever.”

Amazon

To buy: amazon.com, from $6 (originally $30)



The most common complaints about flip-flops are the straps causing blisters or breaking, but I’ve kept the same pair for years and have hardly seen any wear and tear, despite using them as an alternative to sneakers while running around a new city or taking a coastal trek in the South of France, where I split my time. And Amazon customers agree. One reviewer said, “They haven’t caused me any blisters or irritation, and they are comfy enough to run around with on the beach. You definitely get what you pay for with these, in a good way.”

Despite how many pairs of sandals I’ve acquired over the years, whether they be the Bottega Veneta slides that are currently having a moment or cutout leather Greek Zeus+ Dione beauties I found on sale one summer in Athens, they don’t compare to my trusty Havaianas. While they’re a slim fit, I find they’re true to size. One shopper even said “the slim feel better.” Another reviewer, who has high arches and arthritic feet, reported that “these are the most comfortable, ever.”

Amazon

To buy: amazon.com, $17 (originally $34)



I’d like to pretend I’m one of those travelers who is pragmatic, never overpacks, and only brings items that serve a purpose. But, dear readers, I am not one of these people I admire for their streamlined suitcases with one pair of practical footwear they can wear straight from a run to dinner. I may only have a carry-on, but that suitcase has a few footwear staples to make any outfit look put together — even if said outfit is hiking gear. But my Havaianas are the one pair of shoes I know will make the final edit while packing.

With non-slip tread ensuring your feet are secure whether you’re in the rain, spa, or trekking along a rocky coastline (this happens more than you’d think), these are sure to become your suitcase staple like they’ve become mine. If I’m not evidence enough, just listen to the thousands of customers giving the classic Havaianas Slim Fresh Flip-Flop sandals a five-star review. And add a pair (or two) to your cart before they sell out at this low price.

At the time of publishing, the price started at $6.

Here, you'll spot tea connoisseurs flocking to towns like Trelew and Gaiman in search of the perfect brew and throngs of visitors congregating to Peninsula Valdés during whale-watching season. The easiest way to reach Peninsula Valdés is via bus or car from Puerto Madryn or Trelew, Atlantic Patagonia's main cities. Mar y Valle, a reputable bus service, offers transportation to Peninsula Valdés from Puerto Madryn for about $16.50 ARS (roughly $3.75) each direction.

Punta Tombo wildlife sanctuary, located about 154 miles south of Puerto Madryn, is also worth a trip. Here you'll find dozens of charming Magellanic penguins mingling along the shores. To reach Punta Tombo, drive southbound on RP 1, which leads to the sanctuary.

Trelew is less congested than other Atlantic Patagonian villages. Here, you'll find an infusion of Welsh culture with traditional tea houses and Eisteddfod, a Welsh literary and music festival established in Patagonia in 1875. Visitors also come for the broad selection of nearby sites, including the Egidio Feruglio Museum of Paleontology. The best way to reach Puerto Madryn and Trelew is via plane.

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/12/patagonia-climate-crisis-for-profit-company,‘We’ve lost the right to be pessimistic’: Patagonia treads fine line tackling climate crisis as for-profit company,"Under California blue skies, the Patagonia outdoor clothing brand’s corporate campus is bustling with its usual mix of employees, pets – and kids.

Situated in Ventura, north-west of Los Angeles and close to the beach for surfing purposes, the sprawl of neutral-colored stucco buildings is very on-brand for a business with a cult following among environmentalists. Wood-lined interiors make the offices feel more cabin than corporate. Blown-up posters from past marketing campaigns line hallways. “There are no profits to be made on a dead planet,” reads one from 2004.

Employees hold meetings on picnic benches outside. A playground of Patagonia-adorned children, part of the company’s childcare program, abuts an office building. Dogs on leashes trot around with their owners. Further down the road, tourists browse through colorful jackets at the first Patagonia retail store, which opened 50 years ago in 1973.

On the surface, all appears to be business as usual. But over the last six months, Patagonia has been wrestling with an existential dilemma that has long obsessed the company: can the group sincerely fight the climate crisis as a for-profit apparel company?

“If you’re serious about [the climate crisis] and this is your business, you’ve got to develop a level of comfort with contradiction,” said the chief executive, Ryan Gellert, sitting in his wood-paneled office. “The idea of ultimately running a regenerative business, that is the biggest idea that we’re capable of, and we’re a long, long way from realizing that.”

Ryan Gellert: ‘If you’re serious about [the climate crisis] and this is your business, you’ve got to develop a level of comfort with contradiction.’ Photograph: Maximillian Mann for Patagonia

The company made a big step toward realizing that big idea last September when Yvon Chouinard, the rock climber turned founder of Patagonia, announced that his family will reshape the way it controls the privately held company. Under the new structure, 2% of the shares and all decision-making authority has been transferred to a family trust, giving the Chouinards continuing control over corporate decisions and the mission. The rest – 98% of the stock, worth about $100m a year in dividends – will go to a new non-profit, the Holdfast Collective, focused on climate activism, including political advocacy.

Patagonia will soon have three core activist segments. As it has since 1985, the company still donates 1% of its revenue to community-oriented, grassroots environmental groups through small grants, worth up to $15,000. The creation of the Holdfast Collective introduced a second activist arm, a non-profit that will funnel larger grants and donations in the millions.

Then in April, the company will formally launch a third activist unit, Home Planet Fund, a non-profit that will fundraise and funnel money to those fighting climate change in isolated and fragile regions, with particular attention to Indigenous communities.

“We’re all orienting in our different roles toward the same goal,” Gellert said. “We look at the 1% giving as walking the countryside, spreading seeds. Now all of a sudden, we’ve got something really significant … The money is in the process of going out the door right now.”

Over the years, the company has grown into one of the largest outdoor apparel brands with more than 70 retail stores globally and nearly $1.5bn in yearly revenue. Business analysts say the company has grown quickly, particularly when compared with competitors like The North Face, in part because it has a history of being vocal on the environment.

Gellert is aware of the skepticism that comes from those who look at Patagonia’s donations and see a brand doing effective marketing. His management team has long grappled with how growth interacts with, or even contradicts, environmental activism.

“For years, I was tormented by the realization that my own company, dependent on the consumer economy, was responsible for some of [the] overabundance of goods,” Chouinard wrote in a 1995 essay. He decided his business could be a model in “taking the long view and doing the right thing”.

In 2002 Chouinard co-founded One Percent for the Planet, which has convinced other businesses to donate 1% of their sales to fighting climate change. He was an early adopter of making clothing with organic cotton, recycled materials and fair trade labor. Patagonia invests heavily in overseeing its supply chain, with a particular focus on labor rights and environmental impact, and has conducted research on its own problems in both sectors.

Patagonia has also been vocal about the effects of climate change, funding documentaries, suing the federal government over protection of a national monument and boycotting advertising on Facebook and Instagram because their parent company, Meta, has failed to stop the spread of “hateful lies and dangerous propaganda” on its platform. It’s a move that the company says has negatively affected sales.

Now Patagonia is trying to send perhaps its most radical message to date – that corporate profits need not always go to share buybacks, outsized CEO pay, yachts or sending rockets to Mars.

“At some point, when this set of options was coming together, that’s when we started asking ourselves, ‘God, this structure is so often used for a different set of purposes. What would it be like to change the narrative around this structure?’” said Gellert, who was part of the small group of advisers who helped the Chouinard family come up with the ownership structure.

The Holdfast Collective is set up as a 501(c)4, a type of non-profit under the US tax code that does not need to pay federal taxes and can spend on political lobbying and advocacy (as opposed to standard non-profits, which are prohibited from engaging in political campaigns).

In the last decade, these type of non-profits have most often been used by conservatives. Last year, the New York Times reported that Barre Seid, the owner of electronics manufacturer Tripp Lite, sold the company for $1.6bn and gave all the proceeds to a 501(c)4 dedicated to Republican causes, including appointing more conservative judges to the supreme court.

Over the past few years, more foundations and billionaires have been donating large funds to fighting the climate crisis. In 2021, $3.1bn of foundation money went toward climate mitigation. The roster of donors includes wealthy individuals whose sources of wealth come from companies often criticized for environmental impact, like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, who set up a $10bn grant for the Bezos Earth Fund. And among Chouinard’s peers, the late Doug Tompkins and his wife, Kris McDivitt Tompkins, the first CEO of Patagonia, had in the 1980s acquired large swaths of land in Patagonia, the national park in Chile and Argentina the clothing brand is named after, for conservation purposes.

Though Chouinard is joining a growing group of climate philanthropists, Ash Enrici, a professor at Indiana University who researches climate philanthropy, said the new ownership structure sets him apart from other donors, because the sums are not capped.

“The family is giving away the source of their wealth … This is in perpetuity, and I think that it’s precedent setting, more so than the amount, the example that sets for other donors,” Enrici said.

Some non-profits have been criticised as ways to avoid tax, or as sources of “dark money” for political purposes because they do not have to disclose who funds them. Patagonia said the Chouinard family paid $17.5m in taxes for the funds that went into the family trust and that they were not looking for a structure to purposely avoid taxes.

Enrici, referencing a 2021 book by Beth Breeze titled In Defense of Philanthropy, noted that the debate around taxes and foundation giving has been going on for years.

“There’s this conversation like, do these foundations have a fundamental right to exist? Should they even be in existence in our society?” she said. “I think that’s a fair question for people to be asking. I also think we desperately need somebody to be helping with the climate and conservation.”

Patagonia leaders, including Gellert, said they are used to taking the criticism that comes with being a for-profit business trying to put up a genuine fight against climate change.

There isn’t a master playbook that we can get from a consultant or off a shelf somewhere Helena Barbour, head of the sportswear division

“Making products creates a huge mess, with horrible impacts around carbon waste, water, biodiversity, social justice – what can we do to try to address that? There isn’t a master playbook that we can get from a consultant or off a shelf somewhere,” said Helena Barbour, head of the company’s sportswear division.

Those working for the company will be the first to admit that even with its profits going to fighting climate change, it still has more to figure out. Like its carbon footprint, most of which comes from the mills that make its materials. Patagonia is also looking at regenerative agriculture, specifically organic cotton, and growing its used products and repair programs, which aim to lengthen the life of its materials.

“I want us … taking responsibility for [our] product and ultimately create as closed of a loop as possible for the materials that we use,” Gellert said. “In doing that, there is a point where we’re probably starting to cannibalize new product sales with second-hand [sales], and that’s a problem I embrace.”

Perhaps one of the biggest problems Gellert is still trying to figure out as Patagonia reaches 50 years in business is how to collaborate with other companies, competitors even, on initiatives that would decrease the environmental footprint of the industry, particularly when it comes to carbon emissions.

“I’ve got two young kids, and I’d be foolish to tell you that I thought my kids are going to enjoy a planet that is in remotely the same shape as the one I’ve enjoyed in my life. It’s incredibly sobering,” Gellert said. “I think we have lost the right to be pessimistic and just sit around and say, ‘I guess this isn’t going to work out.’ We just don’t have the right to do that given what’s at stake.”",['Lauren Aratani'],2023-03-12 00:00:00

Patagonia’s designers know the best gear lasts long enough to collect a few scars – and a whole lot of stories. From the kids’ fleece that’s kept two generations cozy to the duffle that sports a few scrapes from years of use, they make gear built for the long run.

Pushing boundaries for sustainability

Famously willing to take bold stands and stubbornly stick to its ideals, Patagonia aims to create functional, durable clothing and gear with minimal environmental impact.

That means retooling classic designs with 100% organic cotton, 100% responsibly sourced down, and as many recycled materials as possible. Donating to groups working to address the climate crisis. And most recently, converting the business to a trust with the goal of saving our home planet.

You may be questioning why an outdoor apparel and gear company would get into book publishing. To answer that, you’d have to know about Patagonia’s ethos. Founder, Yvon Chouinard, learned how to rappel in 1953 due to his love of falconry, which lead to rock climbing, followed by an interest in blacksmithing to create and sell climbing hardware. Adventure garb came next. Patagonia, since 1985, has been committed to the environment, donating 1% of sales to grassroots environmental groups. Brand devotees buy new and used clothing from this company to power their nature quests skiing, snowshoeing, fly fishing, surfing, kitesurfing, mountain biking, trail running, and, of course, climbing. So, why book publishing? The retort: why not?

Inspiration to move our bodies in the outdoors, under tree canopies, on the water, or through the desert, has long come from the written word. Adventure books have the incendiary ability to shake us off the couch, away from our sedentary lives, and encourage us to try something new or practice what is already well-loved in wide open spaces. Reading stories about self-sufficiency, overcoming hardship, environmental activism, outdoor sports, and time spent in wild spaces awakens something inside of us all. If we play in the outdoors and are grateful for what our earth naturally provides, then we’re more likely to want to protect our planet for future generations.

The following books, published by Patagonia Books, will leave you changed, more informed, and inspired to go outside, recreate, learn new proficiencies, and then make moves to become environmental stewards.

‘Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman,’ By Yvon Chouinard (2006, $22)

Yvon Chouinard, Patagonia Publishing Patagonia

Founder, inventor, adventurer and businessman, Yvon Chouinard, delves into the history of his company as well as how Patagonia operates. Design, production, distribution, marketing, management, and environmental practices are all covered in this photograph-heavy deep dive into cultural consumerism where clothing goes through a five-part cycle, encouraging buyers to reduce, repair, reuse, recycle, and reimagine their garments.





‘Still Sideways: Riding the Edge Again After Losing My Sight,’ By Devon Raney (2019, $27.95)

Devon Raney, Patagonia Patagonia

Author, Devon, has lost his central vision, leaving only his peripheral. Due to a genetic disorder brought on by a surfing head trauma, Devon lost 85% of his eye site. “My value system developed over time,” Devon writes. “Work, consistency, and overcoming fear were part of my everyday process.” Even after losing his ability to see, Devon continued to surf, skateboard, and snowboard, inspiring those around him, including his family.

‘The Voyage of the Cormorant,’ By Christian Beamish (2012, $24.95)

Christian Beamish, Patagonia Patagonia

This is a memoir, full of illustrations, that you’re going to want to read to your children to inspire them to dream big (and unplug from their tech devices). Beamish, a surfer and former associate editor at The Surfer’s Journal, spent two years building an open wooden-hulled boat named Cormorant, followed by two more years learning how to sail. Not everything went as planned in this adventure story, sailing along the coast of California and Baja and surfing along the way, but lessons were learned, and life was lived. “How great it was to be anchored way down in Baja with the side of the boat tent rolled up to let the morning sun warm my body but keep my face and book in shadow, and to read good, sustaining words,” Beamish writes.

‘Closer to the Ground: An Outdoor Family’s Year on the Water, in the Woods and at the Table,’ By Dylan Tomine (2012, $17.95)

Dylan Tomine, Patagonia Patagonia

Tomine is a father first, writer, conservation advocate, recipe developer, and fisherman next. His book challenges readers to think deeper about the world and our place in it, focusing on a simpler way of living in tune with the environment’s seasons. With the Puget Sound as the backdrop, we get a behind-the-scenes look at what life is like for a family living off of the land, foraging and hunting for food, and enjoying a life well lived. “Across the Sound, I can see whitecaps building and a dark wall of rain closing in,” Tomine writes. “The storm is bearing down fast. As we make the turn into the calm waters of the harbor, I look at the kids leaping and laughing in the bow and wonder, Will something of this day become a part of their future selves?”

A beautiful add for any coffee table, Hope’s book on the beloved history of the Hawaiian shirt is one you’ll want to spend time with, flipping through the pages full of photography and stunning illustrations. If you haven’t been to the Hawaiian islands, you’ll want to explore after seeing these images and learning about the spirit of aloha. And, if you have, you’ll want to make plans to return to the land of perpetual summer as soon as possible.

Liz Clark, Patagonia Patagonia

If you’ve ever dreamed of a life aquatic, or if reading about one inspires you, then pick up Clark’s book on her adventures living out her passions on a sailboat and on a surfboard. The seed was planted when she sailed down Mexico’s Pacific coast for seven months with her family when she was nine years-old. Clark takes us through peaks and valleys on this big adventure, with a thread of environmental stewardship smartly sewn through, and then leaves us thinking about our own desires and life’s wants. “I’m ready for big skies, open horizons, and wild islands,” Clark writes. “It’s time to put some miles under the hull.”

‘Salmon: A Fish, the Earth, and the History of Their Common Fate,’ By Mark Kurlansky (2020, $30)

Mark Kurlansky, Patagonia Patagonia

“For the salmon lives life hard, courageously faces countless dangers, sets it chin against all obstacles, and is relentless and unstoppable in its will to carry out its mission,” Kurlansky writes. Salmon spawn in the summer or fall, laying their eggs in a gravel nest at the bottom of a freshwater river. The eggs are fertilized and once the frys are mobile, they swim to the sea to grow bigger, fatter, and stronger for their arduous return to the river of their birth, fighting predators along the way. They swim upstream, against the current, and when home, they spawn and then die. Kurlansky writes about the species’ future, the environmental and human problems that threaten them, and how the survival of salmon is linked to the survival of our planet.

https://www.scu.edu/mcae/publications/iie/v8n1/synchilla.html?assetid=2047,Patagonia and Corporate Responsibility,"From Synchilla to School Support Outdoor Clothing Maufacturer Patagonia Recognized for Corporate Responsibility By Lisa Gardiner More than 20 years ago, Yvon Chouinard, founder of outdoor clothing company Patagonia, began realizing that pitons, the metal spikes used by mountain climbers, were damaging Yosemite National Park's El Capitan peak. In 1972, his company's catalog became a soapbox for ""clean"" climbing gear. Twenty-four years later, Patagonia is still making the preservation of resources  natural and human  a priority. The company was recently praised by President Clinton as an ""impressive"" example of corporate responsibility, both for its family benefits program and its policy of donating 10 percent of pretax profits to environmental organizations  more than $1.1 million in 1995. In addition to its corporate tithing, Patagonia protects the environment through its clothing designs, which are simple, versatile, and designed to last a long time. Many garments are made from Synchilla, a fabric woven from recycled soda bottles. This spring, the company converted to organic cotton. ""We're concerned about the quality of the product,"" says Chief Operating Officer Ed Schmults. ""Environmental aspects are part of that."" In the same vein, the company has reduced packaging. And in the competitive catalog business where everyone ships by air, Patagonia will do so only on request. As the company reminds customers, air transportation uses a lot more fuel and energy than surface transportation. Human resources also get attention at Patagonia, which has been recognized as being particularly family friendly. New mothers and fathers get two months of paid child-care leave, and an on-site child-care program lets employees slip in to see their children during the day. Child-care subsidies are provided, company buses transport children from local elementary schools to the company's Ventura offices, and a school support program allows employees five days off to participate in their children's classroom activities. Parent education seminars are often given during lunch. ""Many companies have programs [like these] in place, but most people think it will impact them negatively if they take advantage of them,"" says Terri Wolfe, director of human resources. But, at Patagonia, taking care of children is a welcomed part of the corporate culture, she adds. Patagonia's family benefits and environmental concerns reflect a willingness to take financial risks, although the company  which grossed $154 million in 1995  is consistently profitable. ""It's a balancing act,"" says Schmults. To fulfill its environmental commitments, for example, Patagonia may invest in a small dye house in Portugal that is unable to afford less toxic dyes without the added capital or switch to organic cotton despite possible problems. ""In order to make this conversion [to organic cotton], we had to lower our profit margin,"" says company spokesperson Lu Setnicka. ""There are significant new risks of supply and performance with organic cotton. All the chemicals  there's a purpose why they're there. We're still moving through that,"" adds COO Schmults. The company can take these risks because it does not strive to grow as fast as it can. ""We sort of look at growth in this company the way we look at a life cycle. If any one component grows too much or too fast, it throws the system out of balance,"" says Setnicka. Sometimes the risks produce failures. Replacing plastic buttons with rain forest tagua nut buttons, as Patagonia once tried, supported an indigenous industry, but the nuts could not survive washers and dryers. The company was swamped with returns. But in other cases, the responsible path also turns out to be cost effective. So far, the move to organic cotton looks like a good business decision. ""Consumer response has been wonderful,"" according to Setnicka. ""Some don't even know we use organic cotton. They're buying it because it's a great product."" Family-friendly policies have also benefited Patagonia, reducing absenteeism and helping the company keep workers, especially women. A cost-benefit analysis found it was more expensive to recruit new employees than to pay for the on-site child-care center  a significant factor in retaining women in the workplace. Women now comprise 65 percent of the corporate staff and 55 percent of the company, and the turnover rate is only 3 percent. Many benefits of the family policies are intangible. Company employees know one another's children, employee morale is higher, and children have a good idea of what their parents do at work, Setnicka says. ""The children are a visual, verbal, and vocal reminder to balance our lives,"" Wolfe observes. Says Setnicka, ""Basically, our mission is to make the best-quality product with the least amount of harm. It's very hard to produce a high-quality product without high-quality employees.""

The challenging, multi-day trek is the southernmost hike in the world.

Run your finger down a map to the far end of the Americas, and the final town you’ll encounter is Puerto Williams, a remote Chilean outpost on the Beagle Channel. Home to just 3,000 people—including scientists, naval officers, and Indigenous Yahgan fishermen—avid hikers know this place as the start of the southernmost trekking route on Earth.

© Photograph by Austin Trigg The lights of Ushuaia, the capital of Argentina’s part of the Tierra del Fuego archipelago, are seen from the Beagle channel during a 36-hour ferry ride to Isla Navarino in Chilean Patagonia. Trekkers reach the remote island—and the Dientes Circuit hike—by both water and air.

The five-day Dientes Circuit around Navarino Island begins and ends in Puerto Williams, where feral horses and wayward cows roam windswept streets that hold a small collection of shops (mostly outdoor outfitters), lodgings (hostels and hotels), and restaurants serving king crab, the local specialty.

Of course, the real allure is above in the jagged pinnacles of the Dientes de Navarino mountain range. Here, intrepid hikers find dense forests of Nothofagus trees which lead, over the course of 33 miles, to peat bogs, lakes, and rugged alpine passes with views south toward Cape Horn, the last dot of land before Antarctica.

“Ten or 15 years ago you wouldn’t find anyone walking up there,” says Maurice van de Maele, president of the local tourism board. “This February there was a new record: 48 people departing in one day.” Of course, that’s a far cry from popular Patagonian hikes such as the W Trek, in Chile’s nearby Torres del Paine National Park, which has become so overcrowded you have to reserve campsites well in advance. For now, fewer than 2,000 people tackle the Dientes Circuit each year. Yet, even in this final frontier, tourism numbers are climbing.

© Photograph by Austin Trigg A trekker doing the Dientes de Navarino route examines her map while camping for the night. The circuit takes five days and thru hikers must pitch tents along the way, since no services are available.

In the next year, Puerto Williams will welcome a new multipurpose pier for Antarctica-bound expedition ships, as well as a passenger terminal at its small airport, making access easier than ever before.

Meanwhile, high-speed Wi-Fi and a shiny new research center have opened the town up to the wider world. Although the hostile climate at this latitude (the 55th parallel south) may keep numbers at bay, the Dientes Circuit seems primed for a larger audience.

© Photograph by Austin Trigg Hikers along the Dientes de Navarino route camp for the night. The weather in the region can be extreme, so trekkers must be prepared for both challenging cold and blazing heat, sometimes in the same day.

‘It’s totally wild’

The Dientes Circuit dates back to the late 1990s when Australian adventurer Clem Lindenmayer developed the route for a Lonely Planet trekking guide. Little used in the ensuing years, it nevertheless developed a cult following that’s grown incrementally alongside Patagonia as a destination.

“I remember my first time doing this circuit and the freedom I felt,” recalls Jorge Barbero, founder of Explora Isla Navarino, which leads guided expeditions. “It’s like you’re the first person walking in these mountains because you don’t see a trail for much of the way—it’s totally wild.”

(Chile’s new national park offers a glimpse of life in the cosmos.)

The circuit begins with a rapid two-mile ascent to Cerro Bandera, a popular day hike among cruise passengers which provides sweeping views over the Beagle Channel. Then, through-hikers follow the Robalo Valley to Laguna del Salto, camping on the first night near a sinewy waterfall. Days two and three involve scrambling over rocky mountain passes, then sinking into wet beech forests to sleep alongside alpine lagoons. Magellanic bog moss makes the path here feel like walking atop a wet sponge, testing the limits of waterproof boots.

Day four is largely uphill, crossing the rocky and wind-battered Paso Virginia back to the north side of Dientes de Navarino to sleep in a sheltered forest below. Day five, by contrast, is mostly downhill toward Puerto Williams through a forest that buzzes with the tip-tapping of Magellanic woodpeckers.

“If the weather cooperates, this is a trip that’s actually quite modest,” Barbero says, noting that the milage and altitude gains aren’t terribly challenging. “But if it doesn’t, it can be much more complicated.” In Patagonia, it’s common to experience all four seasons in a single day. On Navarino Island, locals joke that you can have them all in an hour.

During the short hiking season (November to March), temperatures typically max out around 50 degrees Fahrenheit in Puerto Williams and drop well below freezing on mountain passes. Outside of peak austral summer (January and February), it’s not uncommon to wake up to a tent covered in snow, followed by an afternoon of blazing sun. By mid-March, those brave enough to endure snowstorms enjoy spectacular fall foliage.

A beaver problem

Much of the Dientes Circuit lies above the tree line where there’s no defined path. Yet, signposts every half-mile or so keep hikers on track. Forested areas pose different obstacles, including rambling roots, thick bogs, and prickly calafate bushes. The biggest challenge, though, is the beavers, whose dams reroute the trek each year.

Twenty Canadian beavers arrived on the Argentinian side of Tierra del Fuego, just across the Beagle Channel, back in 1946 to “enrich” the local economy with new industries in fur and castoreum (a gland used to make tinctures for perfume). With no natural predators, the population exploded.

There are now an estimated 60,000 beavers on Navarino Island alone, according to Miguel Gallardo of Navarino Beaver, who takes visitors on tours to see how beavers have destroyed the island’s otherwise pristine forests.

Gallardo is one of just a few people actively working to control the population, eliminating about 60 beavers each year for artisan crafts and culinary experiences. “The properties of beaver meat are actually quite good for humans,” he says, noting that it’s high in fiber and protein (though it does need a good sauce “to cut the bitterness”).

(The best way to combat invasive species? Eat them.)

Beavers create an ideal habitat for other introduced species, namely minks and muskrats, which Gallardo calls “a trilogy of destruction.” The former park ranger hopes an increase in tourism might finally prompt the government to pay more attention to the problem.

The promise and perils of tourism

A strategy to control the beavers remains elusive, but there are plans to make the trek itself more orderly. Currently, there are zero facilities beyond Puerto Williams. Yet, Cristina Altamirano, who heads the municipal tourism office, says there are funds to improve signage, construct dry toilets, and create emergency shelters by the end of 2024.

The infrastructure for tourism in Puerto Williams is growing, too. A new multipurpose pier will open in stages over the next three years with the aim of making this small town a major gateway for trips to Antarctica (companies like Silversea Cruises have already relocated ships here).

(Hunting for the world’s southernmost tree in Patagonia.)

Meanwhile, a passenger terminal will open this year at Guardia Marina Zañartu Airport, which receives six weekly flights (December to March) on Aerovías DAP from the regional Chilean capital of Punta Arenas. Visitors can also travel by boat from Punta Arenas in a spectacular 32-hour journey through the fjords of Alberto de Agostini National Park.

New cafés (Campero), craft breweries (Subantartica Beer House), and hotels (Fío Fío) have opened in recent years to cater to the growth, as has a striking new research institution, Centro Subantártico Cabo de Hornos, for the study of sub-Antarctic ecology. Yet, the town lacks lodgings and restaurants to accommodate more visitors.

David Alday, former president of the local Yahgan community, fears the island may be growing too fast. “The Yahgan community has been present here for thousands of years, and in that time, even when we were large in number, we never produced a great imbalance in the environment,” he says, adding that “the impact on the land is greater today.”

Alday isn’t against tourism; he owns the kayaking company Tánana, which offers excursions in the Beagle Channel showing visitors the seafaring legacy of the Yahgan, who, for nearly 7,000 years, lived further south than any other human population. He just wants tourism’s growth to be sustainable and in line with Yahgan principles of harmony and environmental preservation. “We have to be able to find some balance,” he says, “so that this town doesn’t overflow.”",[],
https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/medical-staff-have-heard-this-anti-union-rhetoric-before/ar-AA19QoSE,Medical staff have heard this anti-union rhetoric before,"© Lane Turner/Globe Staff The corporate offices of Massachusetts General Brigham hospitals in Assembly Square in Somerville.

In his op-ed, “Unionization at Mass General Brigham puts doctor training at risk” (Opinion, April 3), Dr. William Curry wrote that the resident was his “only partner” in the operating room, but it’s David and Goliath at the negotiation table when residents and fellows bargain with the Commonwealth’s largest private employer. Once upon a time, the attending, resident, and patient gathered in a room, but the hospital is no longer just the room itself. Rather, “the hospital” is in the room with us — a corporate entity whose “flexibility” can work residents like laborers but tally them as students. Residents are tired of being fleeced, whether in gifted Patagonia or promised Shangri-la by our “only partners.” I’d rather they secured a bathroom break.

Community doctors’ practices and partnerships have shrunk, but hospital-owned physician organizations like the kind Curry’s hospital uses have grown. These help human resources keep account of their employed doctors but do not help them hold accountable institutions. If I understand senior faculty as spent forces and academic figureheads as impotent totems, then I see no champions and feel no partners. Just sympathizers. Collective bargaining is a natural consequence of a perceived moral threat and professional perversity. Unionization of young doctors is part of a larger generational trend that increasingly values systemic accountability over personal authority.

Michael P.H. Stanley, MD

Fellow, Neurology

Brigham & Women’s Hospital

Boston

As a staff physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, I was disappointed to read the op-ed penned by the chief medical officer of MGH in opposition to the house staff’s unionization drive. The anti-union rhetoric is redolent of that used by large corporations such as Starbucks and Amazon.

Along with Senators Ed Markey and Bernie Sanders, I support their efforts to unionize in order to achieve adequate compensation as well as safe and healthy working conditions.

Mark Eisenberg, MD

Cambridge

In 2014, I started my infectious diseases fellowship at Mass General Brigham. Within a few weeks I felt overwhelmed and anxious, and needed a brief medical leave of absence. I was able to return and complete the fellowship, but it was difficult, and I could have received more support from the institution.

Years later, I am no longer employed by MGB, but I fully support the efforts of residents to unionize. I still am a Mass General patient, and I am certain that if the residents were unionized, the quality of patient care and house staff education would improve.

Philip A. Lederer, MD

Jamaica Plain

William Curry’s op-ed opposing unionization for resident physicians at Mass General Brigham essentially says, “Trust me.” Alas, if residents and patients like me had been able to trust MGB all along, there would be no need for a union.

A union for resident physicians won’t solve all of medicine’s problems, but it will at least give young doctors a voice to try to fix the mistakes the older generation has made.

Sue Bass

Belmont

Dr. Curry’s reaction to the current organizing drive by doctors at Mass General is well meaning but lacks a critical understanding of why they want a union. The residents and interns at the Brigham want a direct role in improving the overall care of their patients, since our health care system in the United States is broken. In addition to receiving excellent clinical training, these doctors are fighting for a role in decision-making to improve the health of their patients, not just a specific procedure. These doctors are not forming a union simply for better wages and benefits, they have a much larger agenda.

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed how the challenging working conditions of nurses, doctors, and other front-line health care staff had a direct impact on patient care in troubling ways. These circumstances helped crystallize for many residents and interns, in numerous hospitals in the United States, that increased collective actions are needed by them, and other health care staff, to improve access and quality of care. They view these activities complement — in important ways — their clinical education.

Having a union for doctors doesn’t take away from the clinical training of doctors but provides them opportunities to have a broader impact on the health of patients and our communities.

While the number of people working in cybersecurity is at record levels, there's a need for more, especially women. But where will they be found? Some might say middle school.

The need for cybersecurity professionals is expected to grow by almost 3.5 million jobs this year when compared to 2021 numbers, but the available workforce isn't keeping pace.

Many in the industry say the gap is largely because of a lack of interest from young people entering the cybersecurity job market, particularly women who only account for 25% of the jobs.

""There is an underserved community of women engineers in technology,"" said Scott Reed, a senior account executive at ePlus Technology.

DeAnza Academy of Technology and the Arts in Ventura now has GRIT: Girls Re-Imagining Tomorrow. Founded on the East coast in 2017 by ePlus Technology, GRIT shows middle school girls the possibilities available to them with a career in technology.

Middle school is an important age to start because a recent survey of women who work in the field showed 78% developed an interest in science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, in middle or high school.

""Being able to work with Patagonia, ePlus and other community partners has provided all our girls a networking system to figure out for themselves, 'Hey, I can realize this dream that I have,' and because of what we do here at the school, it really makes the learning relevant. It brings the learning to life,"" said Carlos Cohen, the principal of DeAnza Academy of Technology and the Arts.

The program has grown to seven schools across the nation, introducing girls to online safety, public speaking and business etiquette, while inspiring curiosity in various areas of STEM through field trips similar to a trip to NOAA in Oxnard where other young women explained their path to success to the girls from DATA.

""A bunch of the ladies we have met so far are engineers who work on boats and solve problems and that is something I might want to do in the future and seeing how they do it and what resources they use really helped me,"" said GRIT participant Gwen Anderson.

""When I think of jobs, I think like, firefighters or like, police or doctors. But, now I can see there's people who help the environment or people who make software or even like, make clothes,"" said Flor Arroyo, who is also a participant in GRIT.

GRIT was so popular in year one, there was a wait list to get involved for year two. So the DATA team created a GRIT club that includes any girls who want to get involved.

Reed explained what he hopes GRIT can accomplish over time.

""I want them to dream and I want them to imagine, and if we arm them with the confidence and the mentorship and a lot of the core curriculum that we're doing, they can say, 'I can see myself doing this,' and I think it provides a lot of hope and encouragement about the future,"" said Reed.",[],

It’s not a surprise that UNESCO proclaimed the Dolomites Italy as one of the world’s most attractive mountain landscapes.

The Dolomites in Italy known for their dramatic peaks, picturesque villages, and world-class skiing. The air is clean and crisp, and there is a sense of peace and stillness here that can’t be found in a city.

So Why Are The Dolomites Italy Often Overlooked?

First is the difficulty. People think these mountains are too difficult to hike. And to be fair, if you look at the google pictures to judge, it is easy to see why. The second is world geography.

People don’t know where they are and therefore have a misguided perception that they are challenging to get to. The third is awareness. They’re not as famous as the Swiss Alps or other equally impressive mountain ranges that have traditionally received more press or marketed to tourists as a vacation destination.

10 Things I Learned from my Summer in The Dolomites, Italy

© Provided by Planner at Heart Courtesy Deposit Photos

I have always loved being in the mountains, and the Dolomites have won my heart this summer. I spent a month exploring most of the valleys and learned a few things. Bottom line, when I am in the Dolomites, I feel like I can breathe more deeply and live more slowly. And that makes it my favorite place in all of Italy to visit!

1. Hiking Difficulty: Easy & Medium!

The Dolomites are a popular destination for hikers and nature lovers from Europe, but not so much Americans. The Dolomites offer some of Europe’s most scenic hiking trails, so why are Americans staying away?

Many people don’t realize that these majestic mountains are pretty easy to hike. Unlike other mountainous regions, the Dolomites have a few well-marked trails of varying difficulty levels, so it’s easy to find one that fits your ability. My favorite easy/medium hikes are:

Adolf Munkel Hike to Geisler Alm Hike (Medium )

Cadini di Misurina Ridge Hike (Easy)

Seceda Ridgeline Hike (Easy)

So whether you’re a seasoned hiker or a first-time visitor, the Dolomites in Italy are an ideal destination for a hiking adventure. Just be sure to bring your camera. The views from around these towering peaks are breathtaking.

2. Instagram Ain’t Got Nothing on These Views

The other day, I was scrolling through Instagram and saw a stunning photo of the Italian Dolomites. It looked so perfect like it had been Photoshopped. And the truth is, even the most stunning images don’t do justice.

In reality, the mountains take over your entire view. Everything surrounds you; the peaks, the trees, the wildflowers, and even the mountain cows lend to the experience. There’s just no way to capture that feeling on camera. No filter or app comes close to the natural beauty of these mountains.

3. Bang for Your Buck Compared to the Swiss Alps

Budget is my favorite b-word. If you compare hiking and staying in and around the top mountain destinations in Europe, the Italian Dolomites are comparatively cheap!

I’m talking about comparisons like the French Vosges, Spanish Pyrenees, the Swiss Alps, the Austrian Alps, Norwegian Mountains, and even the hikes in Iceland. While all of those are beautiful in their own right, so are the Italian Dolomites. And the Dolomites, have pizza!

It is possible to spend two weeks in Italy and Switzerland on a road trip for under $4,000, just like we did.

4. Planning is Absolutely Essential

Any trip with mountains needs to be planned out because things always take longer than you think, are more sold out than you think, or the weather messes with you more than you think. I learned that booking a month ahead is best in the Dolomites, even in the peak summer season.

There are so many Hidden Gems in Northern Italy around the Dolomites if you have time to check out a few of the surrounding valleys.

5. Hut to Hut & Via Ferratas for the Brave

When it comes to hiking, I prioritize scenic views and adventure. However, the Italian Dolomites have plenty of easy, medium, and hard-rated hikes and Via Ferratas. This mountain range has hikes for all skill and comfort levels.

Hut to Hut hiking is a multi-day hiking adventure with a pack. You are effectively walking from peak to peak, lodging overnight at the different mountain huts where most day hikers have dinner and beer before returning to the parking lot. The huts are super cute and worth a night’s stay even if you don’t choose Hut to Hut.

For those who love a good adventure, a Via Ferrata is the perfect way to get your heart pumping while enjoying some stunning scenery. Via Ferratas, “iron ways” in Italian, are routes outfitted with metal cables and ladders to help climbers make their way up cliffs and cliffsides.

While they originated in the Italian Dolomites during WWI, today, there are via ferratas all over the world, ranging from easy to highly challenging. My favorite medium-level Via Ferrata was Tridentina al Pisciadu.

6. It’s Both Italian and German

There is nowhere else in the world where the seemingly clashing cultures of German and Italian come together better than with pizza and beer! The region of Sud Tyrol where the Dolomites are located in this exact intersection.

People here speak both Italian and German, or a dialect of both. But, of course, they also speak English, so you’ll be able to communicate. German and Italian cuisine is served readily – pizza and pasta, bangers and beer, and a special little German dessert called Kaisersmarn! It was all delicious.

7. Choose Your Airport Carefully

The Dolomites and Sud Tyrol, my favorite region to stay in, have three international airport options. : Munich, Germany (3 hours away), Innsbruck, Austria (2 hours away), and Venice, Italy (2 hours away). We opted for Munich airport simply because it offered the best connections from the United States, and the rental cost of the car was cheaper than the other options. Make sure to compare and contrast all the options as they can vary.

8. You’ll Want to Rent a Car

While there is an extensive network of busses around the mountain to do things at your leisure generally, you’ll want to rent a car. Add to that the Italian version of schedules and time, and relying on the bus schedule can potentially be a frustrating endeavor for Americans.

We rented a small automatic car from the nearby airport in Munich for two weeks at just about $500, and we were okay. Make sure to read the fine print for all the required documentation needed to rent a car. Driving in Europe as an American can be a bit wonky, especially in Italy, but if you go in with expectations understood and a good stomach for winding mountain roads, you will be fine!

9. Visit in the Summer

The Dolomites are known for great skiing, excellent summer hiking, and wildflowers. Of course, they are pretty every season, but gondolas and funiculars to get to some of the hikes are not open till early summer.

Additionally, restaurants and towns are primarily active during summer or winter but less so in the Spring and Fall. The fall season is beautiful, but it’s also peak season for European tourists and will be more packed than usual.

10. Don’t Fully Trust the Weather Apps

Mountain weather has a mind of its own. Clouds or the sun move in and out quickly, no matter where you are. We did our best following our iPhone weather app, but it was unreliable. Every day showed rain, but it rained hard for 30 minutes and then back to stunning July sunshine.

The main lesson here is to go to the hike you’ve planned for the day and make a call from there. If the weather conditions are poor, you shouldn’t go on the hike but instead hit up a local wine and cheese restaurant. Instead, you can enjoy a slow day and the smell of rain in the mountains.

If your whole trip looks rained out in the mountains, consider re-routing to the Italian Coastal Towns nearby for a bit of sunshine!

Adventure jars began as a simple way for two women to find a work-life balance but ended up being so much more than that.

Working as two corporate employees for a tech company in California, Kaysie Nielson and Tosh Swain found it hard living in a new place and separating their work from their free time, especially during the pandemic.

“Kaysie made this adventure jar that had a whole bunch of ideas for us to explore Orange County because we were new to the area and wanted to try new things,” Swain told the Deseret News. “When we first started thinking about how we could balance our time with work in a more meaningful way, we contemplated making adventure jars for different cities for people to get out of their own comfort zone.”

As Nielson and Swain realized how this idea helped them achieve a work-life balance, they eventually decided to quit their corporate jobs and turn their adventure jars into the Utah business and marketplace called Exploring Not Boring, where creators and adventurers can collaborate and explore the world around them.

“Crazy doesn’t even begin to describe the journey that we’ve been on but now it feels genuinely rewarding to be where we are and it’s exciting to be building this marketplace,” Swain said.

But Nielson and Swain aren’t the only Utah entrepreneurs that started their business seeking this balance in their lives.

What motivates Utah entrepreneurs?

In fact, most Utah entrepreneurs have started their businesses because they desire a better work-life balance, according to recent findings.

OnDeck analyzed recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s latest Annual Business Survey on why people across the U.S. start their own businesses and found Utah to be the leading state for entrepreneurs who start businesses to find a better balance between “work and family” and also for those seeking “flexible hours.”

© OnDeck

James Barnes, creative and research team lead of NeoMam Studios, told the Deseret News, “A method similar to the location quotient was used in the study to determine which reason for starting a business was deemed much more important in a particular state or metro compared to the country’s overall average.”

Barnes continued, “For example, 65.4% of business owners in Utah said ‘balance work and family’ was very important to them as a reason for starting their business. This was 1.13 times higher than 57.6% of business owners who said it was very important to them in the United States overall. This means its location quotient was 1.13, and it was the highest of all reasons in Utah, which is why it was deemed Utah’s most distinct reason for starting a business.”

The Deseret News previously reported that many tech workers have come back to Utah to enjoy the outdoors in their off time from working.

“Now we have real evidence that ... this has been an important piece of the growth we’ve had here,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said. “I was especially amazed at some of the numbers, including that 85% of tech sector workers who chose to stay in Utah despite a higher salary offer elsewhere, said that outdoor recreation was the reason they chose to stay here.”

The difference between East Coast and West Coast motivations

Related

Jim Granat, co-president of OnDeck, told the Deseret News, “The regional differences likely come down to a range of factors. Culture, business environment and a family history of small business ownership can all play a role.”

The Deseret News reported that especially after the pandemic, some people in Utah wanted to be home with their families and working more flexibly to enjoy a balance between their responsibilities and living a present life.

Nielson told the Deseret News, “We were just working a ton and weren’t able to explore much at the time, especially with the pandemic stopping the world.”

For many during quarantine, the days would repeat themselves: wake up, work remotely, stay inside and find a way to not be bored till you woke up the next day.

“We weren’t happy giving all of our time to this company. ... We’re very passionate, driven people and we kind of look at life as if you have this one life to live, you should do so meaningfully and you should put your time into things that matter and people who matter,” Nielson said.

While Utah seems to be home for entrepreneurs like Nielson and Swain, who want to create a better work-life balance, the state didn’t rank as high in other categories, according to OnDeck.

When asked why Utah isn’t one of the top states for the “best avenue for ideas” category, Granat said, “A potential reason is that employers in Utah are creating space for their employees to explore their ideas so they don’t feel the need to go solo to do it.”

Where Utah ranked low in some areas, different states would fill the top spots. OnDeck reported that:

East Coast entrepreneurs were motivated by “family connections such as a family business or role model.”

West Coast entrepreneurs were more motivated by “family responsibilities” and “freedom to work.”

New York and Delaware were the only two states that had “couldn’t find a job” as a main reason for owning a business.

Analysts found that people were “reluctant to take a new job on a lower rung” after losing their positions prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Bigger implications of entrepreneurs in the U.S.

Related

Entrepreneurs throughout the U.S. have started businesses for different reasons and come out with different effects on the country as a whole.

For some companies in the West, entrepreneurs have been able to take their company from a one shop wonder to a national chain.

The Deseret News reported that one of the most popular Utah-based cookie companies, Crumbl, has expanded all across the nation, saying, “Fans of the brand may not realize that before Crumbl could take over suburban strip malls nationwide, it first had to conquer the cookie landscape of its home state, Utah.”

Crumbl expanded as a business from one shop to 786 shops across the U.S. in less than six years.

Other companies such as the popular outdoor brand Patagonia began in California but have expanded to Utah and other parts of the nation as it has trended in outdoor fashion.

For Exploring Not Boring, Swain and Nielson have visions to take their Utah-based business and expand to the rest of the globe.

“The goal is to be global, but of course we’ve got to start smaller and build our reputation up, because we are both from Utah and we already had a lot of connections here,” Swain said. “We already have partners throughout the world from Japan, Australia, India, Peru, Columbia and even partners in different parts of the U.S. like Florida and Orlando.”

The importance of knowing what motivates entrepreneurs

The Commerce Institute reported that on average, there are 4.4 million businesses that are started every year. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau showed that 5,044,748 new businesses began in 2022.

“Finding the reasons why people start businesses and the location where they do are useful statistics in learning the characteristics of business owners,” Barnes said.

Barnes continued, “Along with the other data included in the Census Bureau’s survey, these can be used by different government and private sectors for various purposes such as assessing business assistance needs, determining programs that could help promote activities of disadvantaged groups, and allocating program resources.”

Granat also said that these findings could be useful for future entrepreneurs to see what areas may align with their vision for business goals.

“Small business owners are some of the most passionate people you’ll meet. We wanted to better understand the drive that got them started and keeps them going,” Granat said.",[],
https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/the-10-people-you-meet-at-kids-sporting-events/ar-AA19RqAE,The 10 people you meet at kids’ sporting events,"© pongsakorn_jun26 - stock.adobe.c Is that a coach or a parent? Sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference.

Spring sports season is here, so it’s prime time to conduct a socio-anthropological study of the mating dance that occurs among parents on the sidelines. After a winter of hibernation (except maybe in hockey rinks), an array of characters surface, chrysalis-like, with tumblers filled with mysterious beverages, monogrammed blankets, and, in some cases, dreams of securing their child a Division I soccer placement at age 7.

I asked readers to weigh in with their sideline observations, petty grievances, and humorous asides — and you did not disappoint.

First, there are the cliques.

“I feel like I stick out as a sore thumb at lacrosse games because I don’t wear leggings and Pom Pom hats. The moms all seem to know one another,” griped one leggings-less woman who asked to remain anonymous since her child still plays lacrosse.

There are also the clique-busters.

“Inclusive social director here. I think I have a hard time turning off my inner business owner/hairstylist, and I get anxious if I think someone around me feels excluded,” says Melrose’s Kerry Zirpolo.

“My entire social life basically revolves around my child’s sports. It took a bit of time, but I talk to pretty much all the parents,” adds Medford’s Rebecca Schrot.

Then there are the parents who think their child is auditioning for a scholarship in third grade.

“There was one guy on the opposite side of the field who yelled at our players and the ref the entire game. It was not a close game. He was just brutal to the ref. I felt so badly: The ref was a teenager,” says Douglas Neu, a coach with the Arlington Soccer Club. “Before you yell, remind yourself that you’re yelling at someone else’s kid. It could be your kid someday.”

Of course, we mustn’t forget the parents who never yell at their kids — even when they’re lighting squirrels on fire during drills.

Ahead, here are the 10 people you’re likely to encounter on the springtime sidelines, ranked from least to most nefarious. Did I miss someone? Tell me. I’m sure you will!

The social director. This dynamic spectator rolls in with a mimosa cart and a full breakfast buffet at 7 a.m. Inclusive, gregarious, and with a seemingly bottomless budget, this person should and will become your new best friend (at least, until your team is eliminated).

The small-talk expert. This loquacious gem, now on their fifth child, is the glue who holds sideline chatter together, finding commonalities among a motley crew of parents where there is none: Can hold forth on Disney hotels, suspicious science teachers, traffic patterns, field maintenance plans, zoning by-laws, and school committee gossip with ease while somehow remembering everyone’s name, everyone’s child’s name, and their carpool needs.

The mayor. This proud parent shows up three beers in prepared to rally the crowds, having made the rounds at six other fields earlier in the day. Still dreaming fondly of a 1998 championship, they are now reliving their glory days with abandon. Harmless until the ref makes a bad call; happy to fit 12 kids into his backseat after the game; usually has a cooler full of White Claw. May or may not have a child on the team. Basically a Bruce Springsteen song in a fleece vest. Generally lovable.

The fashion maven. Of-the-moment leisure-wear, flattering sunglasses, bedazzled drink receptacle, a Patagonia for all seasons: This stylish spectator makes you wonder why you were even born.

The sad shepherd. This beleaguered individual arrives at games with a straggling multi-generational posse, 10 chairs, a picnic table, a blanket the size of Monaco, board games, a mesh tent, and a small portable toilet, quickly forming a delicate ecosystem without regard for others’ personal space. Will order DoorDash midway through the game or else produce a multi-course meal from variously sized Tupperware containers at odd intervals. May spend the night.

The lone wolf. This person barricades him or herself with a laptop, mosquito net, and wide-brimmed hat on the outskirts of the field. Do not approach. Best not to even try.

The wall. This hapless observer — often a dad, but not always, per my spies — drapes himself over the fence at baseball games, blocking everyone’s view. Occasionally, this species will call out a halfhearted and perhaps misdirected instruction, leading actual coaches to intervene and offer this lost soul a token role on the team, such as vice assistant interim manager.

The budding Olympian. This parent believes that their 9-year-old is on the brink of a full college scholarship. Do not even attempt small talk; they’re busy making a reel to share with … whom, exactly? Usually spotted hovering anxiously on the sidelines; forming strategic alliances with coaches; speaking in intense whispers to their progeny in the parking lot after the game. Child frequently has several social media accounts with sports highlights and chosen numbers by age 3.

The climber. Is your child a fantastic goalie? Her child is too and actually belongs to four other elite teams in towns you’ve never heard of — she’ll text their info. But start planning a year in advance because tryouts are intense. Have you signed up for the clinic yet? Oh, you don’t know about the clinic? She’ll text you about that, too. Maybe.

The oblivious parent of a destructor. This parent yaps cluelessly as their child eats twigs, digs ditches, climbs a tree, impales himself on a chain link fence, and splays himself across the third base line singing show tunes. When approached by a volunteer coach desperate for support, this parent might halfheartedly say, “C’mon, buddy, focus” — and then return to talking about “Succession” with a neighbor while their child leaves the premises to shoplift at CVS.

All that said, the sidelines can be a wonderful community gathering space and a life-affirming means to connect.

“Mine is not the kid scoring winning goals or even knowing what to do with the ball at times, and I have been met with nothing but kindness and friendliness. I don’t know if it is like this for the more advanced teams, but my experience has been only sunshine,” says Medford’s Shira Cohen-Goldberg. “Isn’t parenting all about small talk with the other folks who have the kids that yours are playing with? I actually think that these are the micro steps that build community.”

Indeed. See you out there!",[],

© Provided by GearJunkie My Hips Don't Lie: The Problem (And Some Solutions) With Women's Wetsuits

It was midday afternoon at Trestles, just south of San Clemente, Calif. - the whole world and then some had come to claim a peak or two, but not before beating their chests wildly to assert dominance.

A wave comes straight to me. As I crane my neck from scanning the horizon back down to face my board, the Velcro latch from my wetsuit makes its own claim from the back of my head, yanking out a few inches of locks.

And somehow, underneath that Velcro, the zipper snuck down the tracks, fully exposing my back. Suddenly, the entire Pacific Ocean flushes into my wetsuit, rendering my feverish paddling for that coveted wave completely pointless.

It was a true flounder, in the most annoying sense, thanks to my wetsuit.

Over the past decade, women's gear in the surf industry has primarily been focused on the user-friendliness of swimwear. And while many women brave the waves in warmer tropical waters that give way for cute bikinis, the majority of female surfers are soaking themselves in anything that's 65 degrees Fahrenheit and below.

Enter - the elusive women's wetsuit.

The Problem With Women’s Wetsuits

Made from a variety of materials, but the most prevalent being neoprene, surf wetsuits have been around since the 1950s. They were commercialized for surfers by Jack O'Neill in the ’60s. For decades, these rubber suits have been on the market, though they have also undergone much evolution.

Wetsuits can range in materials and thicknesses, from a thinner 2mm spring suit that cuts that summer breeze to a very thick 6mm suit that prevents frostbite in Norway.

Yes, ""wetties"" have evolved much to the surf crowd's benefit. And yet, a majority of women still can't find that perfect suit. Though women have always been an integral part of the surf scene, the industry (still male-dominated to this day) caters to men.

Some women have carved their own paths by building brands dedicated to women's unique needs. Others suffer in silence, as yet another lock of hair succumbs to a good Velcro scalping.

Historically, most surf wetsuits are designed by men with a man's body in mind: broader shoulders, narrower hips, and not much room for curves. Oftentimes, women lack the same inventory options as men.

Not Seeing a Particular Wetsuit to Meet Your Needs? Here’s Why

“Buy the boy’s version” is what many women have been told, according to a galley of my closest surfer girls.

As an avid surfer about to enter her 20th year of catching waves, I’ve seen women's wetsuits making significant changes in more recent years. This is thanks to brands both big and small giving way to more female designers, though the industry still has more ground to cover.

""I think the category is naturally a bit of a boys club, and I don't mean that in a derogatory way … it just was,"" said Allison Roberts, Women's Creative Director at Billabong. ""It was mostly men designing suits for a mostly male surfing market with male surf shop buyers.""

When Roberts joined Billabong 18 years ago, she saw a gap between the way the company approached the fashion end of the brand and the technical wetsuit category.

""As a surfer who loves both things, I felt like there was a way we could blend those worlds; have surf and wetsuits be a seamless extension of the way we approach our line,"" Roberts said.

More industry experts can agree that as more women started surfing, the need for a specifically female-designed wetsuit increased. Demand finally justified supply, and the industry responded with a shaky start by allowing men leeway to design wetsuits specifically for women.

""When I was at Billabong, I worked on the first Surf Capsule [wetsuit] along with my wife, Allison,” said Hub Hubbard, now wetsuit product developer at Patagonia. ""She came up with the concept of the Surf Capsule, and it ended up being the number one wetsuit collection at Billabong globally. That was probably 2008 or 2009. At that time, the women's range became an actual focus, rather than an afterthought.""

After moving to work for Patagonia, Hubbard and the rest of Patagonia's surf team held a roundtable discussion in 2017 that included ambassadors, designers, and product testers - all of whom provided the team with unfiltered feedback about the company's wetsuits.

""Women are a variety of shapes and sizes; we are fundamentally built differently than men,"" said Ariel Bishop, Patagonia senior designer. ""We get colder, run warmer and we're softer in certain spots.""

With designers like Bishop, Patagonia made significant updates to their 2020-2024 women's wetsuit lines, in addition to completely replacing neoprene with Yulex, an all-natural rubber and petroleum-neoprene alternative.

Women-Founded Wetsuit Brands

Despite great strides made in part by surf brands across the industry, women are still after variety, color, and stretchiness. So, some have struck out on their own path to creating the perfect suit for women.

In 2012, the surf scene exploded with women-owned brands developing swimwear specifically for women surfers. Brands like Seea, based in San Clemente, Calif., entered the market adding flattering spring suits with colorful designs using a newer, stretchier Yulex material.

""I started Seea because I struggled [surfing] a lot in what was out there, so for me tailoring a wetsuit and swimsuit is always key,"" said Amanda Chinchelli, founder. ""The biggest problem we incur is definitely [in] the shoulders, and the gapping in the back and the chest, mostly anywhere with curves.""

But once again - women still needed more wetsuit options. Angela Horacek also answered this call in 2020 by launching San Diego-based Mamala Surf.

""It was during COVID … basically, I couldn't find a 2mm full suit to fit me, yet every guy could buy one. I was surfing in a suit that was supposed to be really nice,"" said Horacek. ""And it didn't last me more than two months. I thought ‘how hard can it be to make a great wetsuit?'""

Improvements Still Needed

If you’re getting hair caught in Velcro wetsuit locks or zippers, or are struggling with torso length or curvature, a custom suit might be the way to go. Still, I noticed a pattern in my friend's gripes - namely, the fit in the hips, shoulders, and curvier areas, as well as gripes with the type of models used to design the actual wetsuits.

""A lot of wetsuits have seams in the shoulder/armpit region that rub when you paddle and cause a rash. And I know newer wetsuits have those seam coverings, but those crack, and then you still end up chafing."" - Collette Gallo, Manhattan Beach, Los Angeles, Calif., surfing for 23 years

""There's no room for boobs. If I could add another complaint - there are no maternity wetsuits at all. I would have surfed more while pregnant if I had one."" - Devyn Hartnett, Newport Beach, Calif., surfing for 26 years

“Seems like they use young females only and the wetsuit lacks better sizing on hips, surfer shoulders, etc. My top-of-the-line suit is either equivalent to last year's top-of-the-line men's suit or this year's second-best suit."" - Natalie Nevins, Newport Beach, Calif., surfing for 25 years

""My biggest complaint about women's wetsuits is getting in and out of them. I struggle from one leg to another, going back and forth and trying to take it off. It’s [even] harder when your hands and feet are almost feeling numb."" - Kama Keohokapu, Oahu, Hawaii, surfing for 30 years

While most common complaints still center on a lack of functional design for women’s bodies and issues with fit, there are some other issues that could benefit from improvements (more options for sizing, like maternity fits!). In an ideal surf world, women will have just as good-fitting, long-lasting, body-forming, technical wetsuits - just like their male counterparts.

There may not be a lot of room for curves in wetsuits right now, but there's certainly room to grow.

The surf industry has made - and continues to make - great strides in improving the user experience for women. Over the last 15 years, that evolution has led to great innovations, including women-led companies. California-born women’s wetsuit brands like Seea, Mamala Surf, and Kassia Surf are great starts. Nothing can be perfect, but we know the industry is working hard to design the wetsuit that every woman wants - and that many still need.

Keep going, surf industry folks!

Increasingly, people are looking for meaning at work. That’s not to say a competitive compensation package no longer matters, but this alone isn’t enough to hold people’s interest. Employees and jobseekers want to feel an affinity with their employer, with nine in ten people surveyed by Tiger Recruitment agreeing they couldn’t work for an organization that didn’t share their values. A recent study goes further, finding that around half of U.S. employees would consider quitting if they didn’t agree with their company’s values, especially around issues such as the environment and social equality.

Organizations that ignore this trend are compromising their ability to attract top talent, while those who embrace it stand to reap plentiful rewards. According to experts, when an employer and employee’s values are aligned, benefits include higher job satisfaction, lower turnover, better teamwork, and more effective communication.

So, just as jobseekers look beyond hard benefits when weighing up a prospective employer, employers should consider more than core competencies in their hiring decisions for a successful match.

From Culture-Fit to Culture-Add

How often have you rejected a job candidate because they weren’t “the right fit”? What you’re really saying is, “I didn’t warm to this individual; they’re not like us”. This reaction is personal and subjective. And if a business only hires for the right cultural fit, it risks building a homogeneous team, impacting any diversity, equity, and inclusion goals it might have. Reframing the recruitment process around values reduces bias, leading to a fairer, more inclusive approach – and a better long-term hire.

So, what do we mean by values? Simply put, they’re the guiding principles that define an organization, what it cares about, and how it operates.

Values can be rooted in morals and relate to behavior – such as sincerity (Nintendo), selflessness (Netflix), or boldness (Forbes). They can be more aspirational, capturing a company’s ethos – such as Google’s Fast is better or Airbnb’s Embrace the adventure.

ESG Focus

Values can also convey environmental or social purpose – such as Patagonia’s pledge to protect our home planet or Ben and Jerry’s desire to support social and economic justice for marginalized communities.

And ESG values like these are what today’s employees and jobseekers care about most. In Tiger Recruitment’s latest Salary and Benefits Review, over a quarter of professionals said an employer’s sustainability commitment will be a top priority in their next job search. Meanwhile, Patagonia’s CEO attributes the company’s hiring success to its focus on doing good. It attracts around 9,000 applications for every open internship and full-time position, and people who join the company rarely leave.

Define, Articulate, And Illustrate

So, how can an employer appeal to values-driven candidates and find the right match? Identifying its core values is the first step. These should be authentic, not empty words it thinks people want to hear. Jobseekers can see through value washing when a firm makes claims it can’t back up or will leave if a company doesn’t deliver on its promises.

A company’s website is often the first port of call for candidates looking for insights into its values and culture. However, candidates will also consult review sites and social media for a more objective view. With Glassdoor’s advanced filters, for instance, jobseekers can quickly ascertain if a company is as committed to diversity and inclusion or work/ life balance as it alleges.

Having defined its values, an organization’s next priority is articulating them – publishing them on its website or including them in job adverts isn’t enough. Hiring managers should demonstrate these values at every stage of the candidate journey and be able to provide examples of what they mean in practice. For instance, one of Tiger Recruitment’s values is excellence. We pride ourselves on offering employers and jobseekers a highly personalized service and going the extra mile. Case in point: when a client approached our private division for two butlers willing to ‘shelter in place’ at their summer residence, we scoured our network to identify the perfect candidates: twin brothers who had previously worked in a similar role at a luxury resort.

Adapt Your Interview Process

So, once an organization has defined its values and can demonstrate them, how can it assess if a candidate is in sync?

The interview process is key. This means speaking openly about the company values so that candidates are in no doubt about what the organization is about and asking values-based interview questions alongside the usual complement of competence questions to find out what makes a candidate tick. The questions should link to the company values, for example:

“Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond for a client.”

“Describe a situation where you found a creative way to overcome a problem.”

“In your opinion, what are the most challenging aspects of working in a diverse environment?”

Behavioral questions such as this help build up a picture of how customer-oriented, innovative, or inclusive a candidate is.

Values-add

Ultimately, making company values an integral part of the hiring process is not only the best way to attract talent that will thrive. It is also the best way to access a wider candidate pool – not just the ones that tick the skills and experience boxes, but those that might bring new skills or perspectives. Ability and experience do matter, but these can be developed in a way values cannot. You can’t teach someone to buy into a company and what it stands for.

With the rise of hybrid working, the values piece is more important than ever. People may not share location, but if they share the same values, they are more likely to connect with the company and be engaged and productive – wherever they are.","['David Morel', 'Amy Danise']",2023-04-11 00:00:00

https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/wild-life-conservationists-in-love/ar-AA19JfK3,‘Wild Life’: Conservationists in love,"Kris Tompkins in the documentary ""Wild Life."" (Jimmy Chin/National Geographic Documentary Films)

Since winning the best documentary Oscar for “Free Solo,” the awe-inspiring 2018 account of rock climber Alex Honnold’s rope-free scaling of El Capitan, husband-and wife filmmakers Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi have continued to capture triumphs of the human spirit. “The Rescue,” their 2021 film about the British cave divers who helped extricate a Thai boys’ soccer team from a flooded cave, was another exquisite white-knuckle chronicle. But last year’s “Return to Space,” a portrait of Elon Musk and SpaceX, treated its subject with all-too-forgiving reverence.

Vasarhelyi and Chin split the difference between the highs and lows of their filmography with their latest documentary, “Wild Life.” In this National Geographic production, the filmmakers tenderly cover conservationists Kris and Doug Tompkins’s decades-long love story, Doug’s death in 2015, and Kris’s quest to fulfill her late husband’s dream of preserving the South American wilderness. If you keep an eye on environmental news, you’ll know how this ends: In 2018, Kris gave away a million acres to the Chilean government, marking the largest private land donation in history and facilitating the creation or expansion of eight national parks across the country.

“Wild Life” lacks the pulse-pounding suspense of “Free Solo” and “The Rescue,” but its depiction of selfless philanthropy is galvanizing all the same. As two Americans who made their fortunes in outdoor attire — Doug founded the North Face; Kris is a former CEO of Patagonia — the Tompkinses faced plenty of pushback when they settled in rural Chile in the 1990s and amassed vast swaths of land. Unpacking the scale of the accomplishment, Vasarhelyi and Chin examine the anti-American skepticism, far-right conspiracy theories and economic counterarguments that hindered the couple’s ecological ambitions.

As with “Return to Space,” Vasarhelyi and Chin could have cast more scrutiny on their subjects. Doug’s younger days, as an apparent womanizer living a life of excess, are barely dwelt on. The same goes for Kris’s admission that she broke off her engagement to another man after becoming romantically involved with Doug. The film also could have grappled more with the notion of privilege, and the optics of a wealthy White couple throwing their financial weight around Latin America.

Kris Tompkins hikes up a mountain range in Patagonia, Chile, in a scene from ""Wild Life."" (Jimmy Chin/National Geographic Documentary Films)

But it’s also hard to see the aspirations of the film’s subjects as anything other than altruistic. That much becomes evident with the help of talking heads such as former Chilean president Michelle Bachelet; Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard, whose own rags-to-riches tale and philanthropic efforts get their due; and Chin himself, an accomplished mountaineer, as shown in “Meru,” the first film he co-directed with Vasarhelyi.

“On any scorecard, nature is losing,” Kris says during one of her interviews, filmed both at her home and during a 2018 expedition to a Chilean peak her spouse once summited. “Wild Life” also deploys extensive archival footage of Doug, including remarkable images from a 1968 trip to the Patagonia region that sparked his passion for South American landscapes. In the film’s most wrenching moment, Doug reflects on his mortality and the realization that he may not live long enough to see his life’s work completed.

When it comes time to address his death at age 72, from hypothermia during a kayaking accident in southern Chile, Vasarhelyi and Chin gracefully re-create the harrowing incident through impressionistic animation. It’s not the only artistic flourish in a film that uses stark graphics to depict the accelerating rate of global deforestation and sets sweeping vistas of the Chilean mountains to a soaring score from composers Gustavo Santaolalla and Juan Luqui, whose work can be heard in “The Last of Us.”

Although Kris doesn’t seem as comfortable in the limelight as Honnold in “Free Solo,” the divers in “The Rescue” or Musk in “Return to Earth,” you can expect to be shattered by her grief following her husband’s death — and uplifted by her strength as she carries on his legacy. In fact, “Wild Life” is at its best when it focuses on Kris’s path toward renewed purpose after an unspeakable loss. By committing that journey to film, Vasarhelyi and Chin show off an invaluable skill: knowing when a story is worthy of preservation.

One of the most inspiring initiatives for us at TIME over the past few years has been convening TIME100 honorees from around the globe. What began nearly two decades ago as an annual list of the world’s most influential people has become a community of leaders from across fields, who join together in venues from Singapore and New York City to Dubai and Los Angeles, to spotlight solutions toward a better future. At this year’s first gathering of TIME100s, in Davos, Switzerland , the overarching theme was the confluence of interconnected challenges, from climate and public health to democracy and equality. That is also the central theme running through the 2023 TIME100 list—starting with the most existential of challenges: climate change. This year’s list features a record 16 people defending the environment, including the new leaders of Australia Colombia , and Brazil , all recently elected on a wave of pro-climate sentiment. Also counted among that group are scientists like Andrea Kritcher , whose experiments brought controlled fusion power closer to reality than ever before; Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard , who donated his company to the fight; and environmental-justice advocate Catherine Coleman Flowers. We also include cultural titans like Angela Bassett , whom singer Tina Turner praises for always having “strength, determination, and big, big dreams,” and pioneers like Sam Altman , whose company released the generative artificial intelligence platform ChatGPT, advancing what Airbnb founder Brian Chesky calls in this issue “the most powerful tool ever created.” Recognized here too are Ozlem Tureci and Ugur Sahin , mRNA-vaccine trailblazers who led the way on COVID-19 jabs and are now turning to cancer vaccines with exciting results. And we may all someday owe a debt to physicist Edward Reynolds , who oversaw a successful mission to collide a small spacecraft with an asteroid in order to knock the latter off course. A passionate group of activists are also on this list, including Shannon Watts , the founder of Moms Demand Action, whose work continues to gain resonance as gun violence remains a tragically daily threat in America’s communities. Central to confronting the world’s shared challenges is the pursuit of truth, an endeavor increasingly under attack. We recognize three journalists who have taken great risks in the course of that duty. Elaheh Mohammadi and Niloofar Hamedi , courageous Iranian reporters, have been jailed over their crucial coverage of the protests against the regime. And the work of Evan Gershkovich , areporter facing bogus espionage charges for reporting on Russia, has galvanized supporters of press freedom around the world. We celebrate Evan’s commitment to our profession and join in calling for his immediate release.

In the wake of the recent kidnapping and murder of U.S. citizens in Matamoros, Mexico, several prominent politicians have called for the designation of Mexican cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) and the subsequent deployment of U.S. military forces to fight those FTOs. Those are two very different things: one is rational and may be helpful and the other is reckless and certainly unhelpful.

Many well-meaning people refer to these organized crime networks as ""drug cartels,"" but that is too simple. These complex organizations exist solely to make as much money as possible and will do anything to get it: kidnapping, extortion, torture, murder, and stealing fuel are all common tactics, as well as moving drugs, people, weapons, and money across our borders. The better label is the government's own—transnational criminal organizations, or TCOs. According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, they may be based in Mexico, but these TCOs operate in every major U.S. city and all 50 of our states, including Alaska and Hawaii. In addition to fentanyl, they move huge quantities of heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine across our borders. The TCOs also tax and control the vast majority of undocumented aliens and asylum-seekers who come through Mexico and end up on U.S. soil.

Are these TCOs terrorists? Hanging a bunch of headless bodies off a bridge or dissolving victims in barrels of acid certainly look like the work of terrorists to me. Terrorists use violence or the threat of violence to influence others, primarily for political aims. One could argue that Mexican TCOs do not have political aims in the United States, but they certainly do in Mexico: they fight the security forces to gain room to operate and they fight other TCOs to eliminate competition.

Innocent Mexicans and Americans are caught up in the violence. The State Department's three requirements for an FTO designation are the organization be foreign, terrorist in nature, and harmful to U.S. citizens. The Mexican FCOs meet those criteria. In addition to the Matamoros and countless other murders, one could easily attribute the majority of U.S. fentanyl deaths (107,375 in 2022 alone) to Mexican TCOs. Mexican TCOs should be designated as FTOs. The biggest benefit of such a designation would better enable us to go after and interdict what the TCOs really care about, which is the flow of money.

This comes with a caveat. Any labeling of the Mexican TCOs as terrorists must not trigger the uninvited deployment of U.S. troops to Mexico or attacks on Mexican soil. Whether it is through a specious reading of the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force against terrorists that was enacted after the attacks of 9/11, or any new war authorization, the uninvited use of military force in Mexico must be thoroughly rejected.

We may see use of force in Mexico as a means of protecting our own citizens, but most Mexicans would view it as an invasion. Mexico is a sovereign country and if we send our troops across the border without Mexican consent or launch attacks from afar, it could be an act of war. In addition to problems for our border states and commerce (Mexico is our largest trading partner, followed by Canada, and China), we would cause incredible problems for the 1.6 million US citizens who currently live in Mexico. Even talking about such a deployment is reckless and does significant harm to our relationship. Our military, law enforcement agencies, and intelligence organizations have deep and important relationships with their counterparts in Mexico, and frankly, we are their partner of choice. Doubt that? The Mexican Army drives HMMWVs and flies Blackhawk helicopters.

A host of three and four-letter agencies operate in close concert with their Mexican counterparts throughout that country. It is in our mutual interests to do so. Stability is essential to trade and the general security of the hemisphere. But rash talk about sending our military into Mexico only causes problems. It drives a wedge into deep, vibrant, largely behind-the-scenes relationships, and it reinforces Mexican stereotypes about their gringo neighbors that have been prevalent since the War of 1846 and the punitive expedition of 1916.

We desperately need immigration reform, and we have real problems with border security. I see those problems every day. Mexican TCOs cause many of those problems and there could be benefits to designating them as FTOs. Grandstanding politicians should refrain, however, from reckless calls to send our military uninvited into Mexico. Such talk will only hurt us and our partners. It's time to build bridges rather than blow them up.

Lieutenant General Jeffrey Buchanan retired after a 37-year Army career in 2019. In addition to commanding the 6,000 troops on the southwest border, he led the military operation in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria and had four tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. He is a senior advisor for the Vet Voice Foundation and he and his wife live on a small ranch outside of Patagonia, Arizona, about 13 miles from the Mexican border.

The waters between California’s Channel Islands and the coast are treacherous and complicated to navigate. So, when the Chumash Native Americans would cross that 20-mile stretch of water, they’d do so in heavy wooden “canoe tomols” made from thick planks of wood.

These boats were sacred to the Chumash, who used them for fishing and trading, and sustaining their own lives and livelihoods. The tomols were functional works of art. People have been making plank canoes like them for close to 3,000 years. Modern canoes take cues from the same design.

But over centuries, after California was colonized, the craft of building these vessels was lost to history. Until one man, a descendant of those people, and Native American activist Alan Salazar picked it back up and started to rekindle the flame. In 1997, he built the first modern canoe tomol in history - and made the epic journey across that channel for the first time.

This Patagonia short profiles Salazar, who’s been recreating the Tomol Route between Ventura and Santa Cruz Island for 26 years. He hand-builds the tomols and paddles himself using the same techniques his ancestors did hundreds of years prior. Then, every year, he and his team load up and hop aboard, prepared to make the 20-mile journey west.

“The very first crossing, my Chumash DNA was asleep,” Salazar says. “Getting on the water in the open ocean in a 24-foot canoe tomol, that DNA kicked in.”

https://www.scu.edu/mcae/publications/iie/v8n1/synchilla.html,Patagonia and Corporate Responsibility,"From Synchilla to School Support Outdoor Clothing Maufacturer Patagonia Recognized for Corporate Responsibility By Lisa Gardiner More than 20 years ago, Yvon Chouinard, founder of outdoor clothing company Patagonia, began realizing that pitons, the metal spikes used by mountain climbers, were damaging Yosemite National Park's El Capitan peak. In 1972, his company's catalog became a soapbox for ""clean"" climbing gear. Twenty-four years later, Patagonia is still making the preservation of resources  natural and human  a priority. The company was recently praised by President Clinton as an ""impressive"" example of corporate responsibility, both for its family benefits program and its policy of donating 10 percent of pretax profits to environmental organizations  more than $1.1 million in 1995. In addition to its corporate tithing, Patagonia protects the environment through its clothing designs, which are simple, versatile, and designed to last a long time. Many garments are made from Synchilla, a fabric woven from recycled soda bottles. This spring, the company converted to organic cotton. ""We're concerned about the quality of the product,"" says Chief Operating Officer Ed Schmults. ""Environmental aspects are part of that."" In the same vein, the company has reduced packaging. And in the competitive catalog business where everyone ships by air, Patagonia will do so only on request. As the company reminds customers, air transportation uses a lot more fuel and energy than surface transportation. Human resources also get attention at Patagonia, which has been recognized as being particularly family friendly. New mothers and fathers get two months of paid child-care leave, and an on-site child-care program lets employees slip in to see their children during the day. Child-care subsidies are provided, company buses transport children from local elementary schools to the company's Ventura offices, and a school support program allows employees five days off to participate in their children's classroom activities. Parent education seminars are often given during lunch. ""Many companies have programs [like these] in place, but most people think it will impact them negatively if they take advantage of them,"" says Terri Wolfe, director of human resources. But, at Patagonia, taking care of children is a welcomed part of the corporate culture, she adds. Patagonia's family benefits and environmental concerns reflect a willingness to take financial risks, although the company  which grossed $154 million in 1995  is consistently profitable. ""It's a balancing act,"" says Schmults. To fulfill its environmental commitments, for example, Patagonia may invest in a small dye house in Portugal that is unable to afford less toxic dyes without the added capital or switch to organic cotton despite possible problems. ""In order to make this conversion [to organic cotton], we had to lower our profit margin,"" says company spokesperson Lu Setnicka. ""There are significant new risks of supply and performance with organic cotton. All the chemicals  there's a purpose why they're there. We're still moving through that,"" adds COO Schmults. The company can take these risks because it does not strive to grow as fast as it can. ""We sort of look at growth in this company the way we look at a life cycle. If any one component grows too much or too fast, it throws the system out of balance,"" says Setnicka. Sometimes the risks produce failures. Replacing plastic buttons with rain forest tagua nut buttons, as Patagonia once tried, supported an indigenous industry, but the nuts could not survive washers and dryers. The company was swamped with returns. But in other cases, the responsible path also turns out to be cost effective. So far, the move to organic cotton looks like a good business decision. ""Consumer response has been wonderful,"" according to Setnicka. ""Some don't even know we use organic cotton. They're buying it because it's a great product."" Family-friendly policies have also benefited Patagonia, reducing absenteeism and helping the company keep workers, especially women. A cost-benefit analysis found it was more expensive to recruit new employees than to pay for the on-site child-care center  a significant factor in retaining women in the workplace. Women now comprise 65 percent of the corporate staff and 55 percent of the company, and the turnover rate is only 3 percent. Many benefits of the family policies are intangible. Company employees know one another's children, employee morale is higher, and children have a good idea of what their parents do at work, Setnicka says. ""The children are a visual, verbal, and vocal reminder to balance our lives,"" Wolfe observes. Says Setnicka, ""Basically, our mission is to make the best-quality product with the least amount of harm. It's very hard to produce a high-quality product without high-quality employees.""

Creating a good hotel, Mark Twain wrote, ""is an art apart,"" and we all have our favorites, of course. This list represents Town & Country's selection of the best, most ""artful"" new places: hotels, resorts, and lodges that opened mostly in the last two years (with adjustments for Covid closures and delays). To compile it, we first consulted a roundtable of trusted, globetrotting travel advisers. Sixty-eight of them nominated 160 hotels they loved (and why), based on their recent experiences and knowledge. We at T&C then culled, added, and culled again. Et voila—46 sensational places to stay.



The list is divided into seven sections: Urban Hotels, Farm Hotels, Historic Mansion Hotels, Beach Hotels, Design Hotels, Wilderness Hotels, and Wine Hotels. You can browse by category, or simply scroll through all of it—it's a revelatory snapshot of the diverse world of travel now, and the perfect place to start making some plans. See you there?—K.G.

Urban Hotels



Cities are bustling again. These new hotels give you a piece of the action—and a retreat from it.

Welcome to your jewelry shopping enabler.

BHARAT AGGARWAL

The Johri at Lal Haveli, Jaipur This transformed 19th-century ­upper-crust house is the creation of Siddharth Kasliwal, ninth-­generation co-owner of India’s famed and oldest jewelry store, the Gem Palace. Conveniently, it is steps from the Johri Bazaar, aka the jewelry market, and its five large suites (there’s also a courtyard restaurant and bar) are a serene blend of heritage and modernity, in shades of their namesake treasures. We love the Neelam (sapphire). But why not book all of them and have a shopping party?

Two top spots in one of the world’s alpha capitals.

Casa Polanco and the Ritz-Carlton, Mexico City It’s a toss-up. The intimate new 19-room Casa Polanco sits on Lincoln Park, close to much of the best shopping in its eponymous neighborhood (think of Polanco as MC’s Beverly Hills).

Ritz-Carlton Mexico City

At the other extreme, the 153-room Ritz-Carlton soars over the city’s grand boulevard, Reforma, and overlooks Chapultepec Park. While other luxury brands got here before it, the R-C has found the formula that appeals to both foreign visitors and local patrons. Even if you don’t stay here, have a sunset cocktail at the hotel’s Carlotta Reforma Sky Bar, for the views and the scene. (Afterward, fly to the Ritz-Carlton in NYC’s Nomad neighborhood; the rooftop bar has become the place to be at the top of the world.)

A clubby place for your Anglophilic fantasies.

Beaverbrook Town House

Beaverbrook Town House, London Several new London hotels are opting for a clubby feel. We love this 14-room place for its great location, off Sloane Square, near where Kensington and Chelsea meet. It’s the sister property of the country house hotel Beaverbrook (former residence of the press baron and social fixture), in the Surrey Hills outside London, and it also has polished service, cozy atmos­phere, and interiors by Nicola Harding: bright colors, eclectic design ­choices, and tons of flair. Lord Beaverbrook would approve.

No location in Istanbul is more eye-popping.

The Peninsula Hotels

Peninsula, Istanbul Few sites take advantage of this city’s magical setting as well as the new Peninsula. On the Karakoy waterfront, it looks out at the ancient peninsula, the Bosphorus, and the Golden Horn. (The hotel is part of the Galataport project, which includes, among many other things, a waterfront promenade and a new home for the Istanbul Museum of Modern Art, designed by Renzo Piano, to open later this year.) While some Istanbul hotels turn to the Ottomans for inspiration, the Peninsula celebrates a different side of the city, with 80 works by contemporary Turkish artists on display. It also enlisted Turkish talent, from celebrated interior designer Zeynep Fadillioglu to landscape architect Enzo Enea.

Italian style in grande-dame France? Mais oui.

Bulgari Hotels

Bulgari, Paris It’s not easy to break into the club of centuries-old ­Paris hotels, especially if you’re an Italian with modern sensibilities. But Bulgari Hotels accepted the challenge in late 2021, moving into the city’s Golden Triangle neighborhood to hold its aesthetic own in a sea of Haussmann and Beaux-Arts. It’s just across the street from the George V yet seemingly in a different universe, all textured neutrals and sleek lines, with just the subtlest hint of its host country—­other than a staggering view of the Eiffel Tower from some of its suites.

The hotel worth leaving the old medina for.

Alan Keohane

Oberoi, Marrakech It’s a trick for a hotel in such a historic city to be both traditional and contemporary, grand and simple. But the Oberoi, 10 years in the making, ­succeeds wildly. (Watch out, Royal Mansour and La Mamounia.) Its setting, on a 28-acre former citrus and olive farm six miles outside town, gives you a front row view of the snowcapped Atlas Mountains. Its soaring public spaces are a knockout, alternating intricate zellige tiles and nejjarine woodwork with swaths of monochrome. The spa, which “floats” on its own pond, has serious modern fitness classes. And the service? It’s an unshakable Oberoi tradition.

Your home in the heart of the fashion district.

Gaetano Ragona



Portrait Milano, Milan This just opened hotel is on the site of a former seminary, to which it owes its grand, light-filled piazza. And it is owned by the Ferragamo family, to which it owes its sleek style and well-appointed leather touches. The location is excellent—the center of everything—but it was built as a place of study, which means you can still retreat from the hustle and bustle of Via Spiga. But if hustle and bustle are what you’re after, there’s a Beefbar downstairs.

Not your grandfather’s grand Spanish hotel.

Edition, Madrid Among the city major recent openings, this one, designed by a triumvirate including John Pawson and Ian ­Schrager, stands out for its all-white, ­retro-glam color scheme (except for where it’s a riot of colors), for the city’s longest hotel rooftop pool, and for its feeling of tranquility, even here, near busy Puerta del Sol. The Jerónimo restaurant, led by Mexico’s celebrated Enrique Olvera, has Madrileños vying for tables.

The premier place in Panama City’s glorious old quarter.

Sofitel Legend Casco Viejo

Sofitel Legend Casco Viejo, Panama City Perhaps the clearest sign of Panama’s revival is the opening, in Panama City’s still somewhat crumbly old quarter, of only the sixth Sofitel Legend in the world. Behind the renovated 1917 waterfront facade (this was once a social club which hosted Queen Elizabeth and Albert Einstein), is an interior with all the contemporary fixings, including spa, infinity pool, and private terraces with views of downtown’s skyline across the bay. The service was excellent from day one, and the Caleta restaurant and rooftop bar Ammi were drawing both visitors (business-suited and kaftan-clad) and locals.

Because one Gleneagles deserves another.

Gleneagles Townhouse

Gleneagles Townhouse, Edinburgh The city's it hotel has managed to achieve its status while never opting for airs of exclusivity or attitude. Minutes on foot from the Old Town, it’s located in a former bank on St. Andrew Square: The grand banking hall now houses a brasserie, and a wellness center is located in the vaults. Rooms reflect a mix of Georgian and contemporary inspirations. (Yes, the townhouse is related to that other Gleneagles in the country, but each has its own identity.)

The perfect spot on the Petersplatz.

Rosewood Vienna

Rosewood,Vienna Vienna’s luxury hotel scene has long been dominated by some very old-school players. So when this new player appeared in August 2022, it introduced itself in an understated way and got every detail right, from the linens to leather remote control covers. At the same time, it provides some fresh energy to a city that can have a hard time relaxing. Case in point, the rooftop bar combines an inviting speakeasy atmosphere with city views. (Most of the major sites of the Old Town are nearby; you are in Vienna's so-called 1st district.)

Farm Hotels

The life bucolic is all the rage (call it ""Green Acres"" redux). Welcome to the new crop of farm retreats, pitchforks not required.

Want to wind down in the winelands? Here you go.

Elsa Young

Sterrekopje Farm, South Africa This 125-acre working farm, minutes from Franschhoek, signals something entirely new in this famed wine country: wellness. The 11 “sanctuaries” (or suites) are geared to highly personalized restorative healing. You choose linen or cotton sheets, AC or not, and the amenities, from soaking tubs to meditation ­areas, are tied to each suite’s health objectives. There are alternative treatments galore, from sound baths to breathwork to (soon) equine therapy, and the gardens that supply the kitchen are just beyond—wild, biodiverse, and abuzz with butterflies, bees, and other insects.



You can now decompress at Deneuve’s rural retreat.

Benoit-Linero

Domaine de Primard, France Imagine a renovated country house owned by an effortlessly elegant French friend—someone like, say, Catherine Deneuve—and you’ll start to get an idea of this 40-room hotel 75 minutes from Paris (30 from Giverny, 60 from Chartres). While the property can’t mention that Deneuve once lived here, we can speak freely—and we think she’d appreciate its refined yet casual atmosphere. Eric Frechon, of the three-star Epicure in Paris, started the restaurant (presumably during time off from Le Bristol Hotel), and there are vegetable and herb gardens, horses, donkeys, and lots of ducks.

New York’s the Well comes to Costa Rica.

Hacienda AltaGracia

Hearst Owned

Hacienda AltaGracia, Costa Rica Arrival at this remote retreat from Auberge Resorts, with coffee farm, stables, and organic gardens, is typically via prop plane over the Talamanca range. After which you are encouraged to begin with a swim and purifying full-body mud mask in a fern-filled, glass-walled hydrotherapy room created by New York health haven the Well. This divine dip sets the tone for anything that follows: a riverside massage, a forest hike, or a fireside nap in your plunge pool–equipped casita. Proof, if it were needed, that nothing enhances nature’s restorative powers more than pitch-perfect, understated luxury.



Play farmer the easy way near Nashville.

Heather Durham Photography

Southall Farm and Inn, Tennessee Forest bathing, apple-picking, falconry, gardening classes, honey tastings… These and other outdoor activities are the draw at this 325-acre working farm a half hour south of Nashville. At dinner, thanks to a seed-saving program, you can eat heirloom and Southern varieties of vegetables that you’ll find almost nowhere else. The rooms and cottages are farmhouse-­inspired (outdoor living spaces, fireplaces), and a 15,000-square-foot spa rounds out the farm-life-the-easy-way vibe.

A cutting-edge lodge in an extraordinary landscape.

Bary Tobin

Flockhill Homestead, New Zealand This 36,000-acre property has been a working cattle and sheep farm since the mid-19th century, a pedigree similar to some of New Zealand’s latest crop of amazing places to stay. (The Lindis, which opened in 2018, is another.) Flockhill’s accommodations, however (one four-bedroom villa for now, 14 more opening in November), by Christchurch architects Warren and Mahoney, are strikingly new, both contemporary and cozy, employing materials like concrete, limestone flooring, and timber to frame the views. The Craigieburn Valley setting, overlooking Lake Pearson, is breathtaking, and the lodge offers premier guided hiking, bouldering, kayaking, and ­other exploratory experiences.

Historic Mansion Hotels

This old thing? Not quite. At these hotels in beautifully reborn historic structures, history adds stardust to the hedonism.

Barefoot luxury on a storied lake.

Stefan-Giftthaler

Passalacqua, Lake Como The property’s name means ferryman, and it’s a fitting one for this former private villa built on erstwhile papal property, which the De ­Santis family, of Grand Hotel Tremezzo fame, recently transformed. To arrive is to be transported into a sanctuary of reflection and barefoot luxury. The 24 suites are palatial; the 12 in the main house feature Baroque frescoes. It is said that Bellini composed some of his operas here, including Norma. The grandeur is leavened by bright interiors and an unpretentious approach to service—you can, for ­instance, ­observe chef de casa Mauro ­Verza in ­action in the kitchen.



A fortress of wellness.

Six Senses Fort Barwara, India It took Six Senses 10 years to sensitively rebuild this 14th-century ruin, with two palaces and two temples on a walled hilltop in a village southeast of Jaipur. It was worth it: The 48 suites are smart Rajasthani modern, the 30,000-square-foot spa has treatments and activities for both the sporty and the spiritually inclined (including sophisticated ayurvedic programs), the pool is gigantic, and the views of the Ara­vali Hills are magical. If you can pull yourself away, Ranthambore National Park and its royal Bengal tigers are 30 minutes away.

A château of your own in the 16th.

MR.TRIPPER

Saint James, Paris The city’s only château hotel, surrounded by its own garden in the chichi 16th Arrondissement, was redesigned last spring by the hot French designer Laura Gonzalez, gaining an indoor pool, a Michelin-starred restaurant, outdoor dining, and new landscaping. The pièce de ­résistance: A nearby villa was turned into five suites with kitchens and private outdoor spaces—homes away from home.

A mansion for horse lovers.

Naoise Culhane

Cashel Palace, Ireland Most of Ireland’s celebrated castle hotels are out in the countryside. This is an interesting exception, located in a Palladian manor in the small town of Cashel, with rooms that look up at the famous medieval Rock of Cashel. It is owned by the billionaire Magnier family, who dominate the Irish stud industry (Queen Elizabeth once visited their nearby breeding operation, Coolmore Stud), and equine activities predominate at the property. It is also near many sites in Tipperary related to turbulent chapters in Irish history; you can trot on over to them.

Beach Hotels

Benguerra? Trancoso? The Fari Islands? Just when you thought beach resorts were been there, done that...

Think Crusoe with infinity pools and Mini Mokes.

Elsa Young/Bureaux

Kisawa Sanctuary, Mozambique Remote Benguerra Island, in the Bazaruto Archipelago, has long been a magnet in the Indian Ocean—the ultimate rarefied dropout. This 740-acre hotel, on its southern tip, with 17 artful thatch-roofed bungalows scattered among the dunes, is its new star. Each bungalow sits on its own beachfront acre, with a private infinity pool and a Mini Moke available for exploring the area. The spa has a ­doctor in residence (plus visiting practitioners), and land-based and marine activities abound. Kisawa partners with the Bazaruto Center for Scientific Studies, a permanent staffed ocean observatory, where Kisawa guests are welcome.

The star of The White Lotus.

Martino Dini

San Domenico Palace, Taormina It may have only recently begun surfacing on everyone’s radar—thanks to a certain hit HBO show—but San Domenico, which was renovated as a Four Seasons in 2021, dates back to the 14th century, when it began life as the home of a Sicilian baron, who donated it to the Dominican order to be used as a convent after he died. It opened as a hotel in 1896 and soon became a glamorous stop on the Grand Tour, hosting the likes of J.P. Morgan, the second Baron Rothschild, Greta Garbo, and Sophia Loren. What’s it like now? Well, we’ll assume you’re caught up on The White Lotus, so need we really say more?

Something cool under the Cayman sun.

Palm Heights

Palm Heights, Grand Cayman Some hotels transcend their surroundings. You remember the property, not what lies beyond. Palm Heights is perched on Seven Mile Beach, and its chic 52 suites all overlook a beachfront of ­Starburst-yellow umbrellas and the dining spots, which include Yashinoki (exquisite Japanese cuisine) and Tillies (a menu derived from the Greater Antilles). A cool-kid crew has made the hotel its own recently (the place found its groove post-pandemic), but families and retirees mingle easily alongside the Emily Ratajkowskis and Evan Mocks. That’s attributable to a staff that sweats the small stuff without losing its cool under the island sun, including curating the books in every suite for each guest.

A perfect oasis in the ultimate party place.

Kalesma

Hearst Owned

Kalesma, Mykonos If you avoid Mykonos because it’s too crowded—too everything—you’re about to change your mind. Kalesma is elegant and private, with food so delicious you don’t have to go out (you’ll want to—that’s the point of being here—but not having to is a blessing on this reservations-only island). Each of the 27 bungalows has a pool and private outdoor space, and the surroundings, landscaped with olive trees, bougainvillea vines, and herbs, are quiet. Close your eyes and you’re in the Mykonos of years ago—but with fresh pineapple juice in the morning.

A real resort on Brazil’s most recherché beach.

Fasano Trancoso

Fasano Trancoso, Bahia Trancoso long ago made the transition from insider’s secret to Brazil’s most exclusive beach destination. This opening marks a new phase in its history. The 40-bungalow hotel stands out as a full resort compared with the town’s older, ­boutique-style places. Architect Isay Weinfeld, who was responsible for the original Fasano, in São Paulo, designed this, as well. The rooms are spacious, with an understated palette of neutrals. Life here, however, unfolds by the pool and on the beach, where the restaurant serves excellent Bahian and Italian fare and you’ll find that lunch seamlessly transitions, ­Trancoso-style, into drinks and then dinner.

The Caribbean with big nature and a bit of Bali.

Nayara Bocas del Toro

Nayara Bocas del Toro, Panama The country’s wild side is one of its big draws, and this solar-powered hotel in the astoundingly biodiverse Bocas del Toro Archipelago has 16 overwater villas fringed by three miles of Caribbean beach, amid coral reefs and mangroves, and two chic new treehouses (with three more to come) designed by “queen of green” Elora Hardy, daughter of jewelry designer John Hardy, and her Balinese firm, Ibuku. Swim, snorkel, kayak, paddleboard, explore—or just exhale.

A magnificent coast gets a hotel to match.

1 Hotel

1 Hotel Hanalei Bay, Kauai It seems perverse that the north shore of Kauai, one of the most dramatic, mystical landscapes in the world (it appeared in Jurassic Park, South Pacific, and The Descendants), has not had a premier hotel until now. The 1 Hotel, of course, is not just a hotel but a philosophy, and all its comforts are enhanced by a core commitment to wellness and sustainability. The interiors­ are in Zen earthtones; the activities, fitness, and spa programming are deep; nearly all the produce and protein served in its four restaurants comes from the islands; and the whole is LEED certified. Which must make Hawaii’s old spirits happy.

Not a Mexican megaresort. Hallelujah.

Etereo/Auberge

Etéreo, Riviera Maya This new 75-room hotel from Auberge, north of Playa del Carmen, is masterfully designed to be respectful of its natural surroundings, and it gives you a beach resort vacation that’s refreshingly chic, sexy, and intimate. One of its restaurants, the casual seaside El Changarro, is a charmer that serves impossibly fresh ceviche, fish tacos, and other seafood. In the rooms, local textiles, carved wooden walls by artist Manuel Felguérez, and floor-to-ceiling sliding doors that open onto the Caribbean remind you you’ve arrived in Mexico’s paradise.

A modern take on the ­Maldives.

GEORG ROSKE

Patina Maldives, Fari Islands In a place where most resorts emphasize solitude and silence, Patina (from Capella Hotels Group) has shaken things up by hitting social notes, too. Its lively Fari Marina Village, which is also open to guests of the Ritz-Carlton and the upcoming Capella Maldives, has a beach club, boutiques, and restaurants. Studio MK27’s Marcio Kogan designed the resort in his signature spare modernist style, which lets the blue skies and sea steal the show.

It will make your friends clamor for your itinerary.

Cosme Paros

Cosme, Paros This Greek island is hardly a secret, though it has long taken a back seat to its flashier luxury resort–laden sisters, Santorini and Mykonos, preferring instead to preserve its fishing village charms. The recent arrival of the chic Cosme—by hoteliers Antonis Eliopoulos and Kalia Konstantinidou, the husband-and-wife duo credited with introducing five-star hospitality to Santorini back in the ’90s—may signal a new era. The hotel checks all the boxes: on the sand, private plunge pools, walking distance to Naousa, fabulous sunsets. We’re going.

You can now “camp” in Punta Mita.

Four Seaspmns

Naviva, Punta Mita Want an alternative to a big-box hotel ? Glamping meets beach life at this Four Seasons collection of 15 tents on 48 acres of land on a peninsula overlooking the Pacific. Naviva’s division between indoor and outdoor couldn’t be more seamless, with tents open to ocean breezes. Each has its own plunge pool and is features decor by local artisans. We applaud one aspect of Naviva’s service in particular: You are contacted by personal guides in advance of your stay, to construct a customized itinerary.

A new beauty in the Balearics.

Six Senses

Six Senses, Ibiza From the moment it opened last year on the Spanish island's remote northernmost coast, the property transformed Ibiza's long-standing reputation as the party central of the Med. An earth-toned vision of terraced buildings tumbling down the hillside to beautiful Xarraca bay, it is equal parts local hideaway, approached via a dirt track amid pine trees, and elegant international resort, combining ""authenticity"" and ""rawness"" with a five-star place to stay. If you still pine for clubbing and all-night ravers on the beach, they're just a half-hour away. But we bet you won't—occupied as you'll be with Six Senses' menu of outdoor activities, classes, and physical and spiritual tune-ups. Or just with swanning around its pools in your kaftan.



A reason to venture beyond Dubrovnik and Zagreb.

Ralf Juergens

Grand Hotel Brioni, Pula Croatia’s rich landscape cradles some hidden gems. In historic Pula—once a major maritime center that was in turn ruled by the Venetians, the Hapsburgs (the royal family vacationed here), and Napoleon—the restored Grand Hotel Brioni (from Radisson) offers respite from the hubbub across the Adriatic in Venice—boat rides between ports are available in the summer—and from the more crowded cities of Dubrovnik and Zagreb. Go hunting for the local delicacy, Istrian white truffles, or enjoy them in-house at the hotel’s three restaurants. A peerless beachfront invites floating in the bracing waters of this quiet archipelago like one of its 14 islets.

Design Hotels

All red? All glass? All circa 1930s? Your statement stay are here.

This oasis of hip is Jaipur’s latest hot spot.

Villa Palladio

Villa Palladio, Jaipur The city’s two expat design darlings, Barbara Miolini and Marie-Anne Oudejans (of Bar Palladio and Caffé Palladio), paired up with Rajasthani ­painter Vikas Soni to create this fever dream of a hotel in a 1980s structure in an enclosed garden slightly outside town that once belonged to a member of the local nobility. The nine rooms vary, but all are many shades of scarlet and shockingly beautiful (the public spaces too), with hand-painted depictions of flora, fauna, and ­other motifs reflecting Mughal and Italian aesthetics. The restaurant is wonderful. Tip: It’s takeover ­heaven.

A paean to Art Deco is the new place in Oslo.

Sommero Hotel

Sommerro Hotel, Oslo The city’s original electrical company (“Light power heat,” proclaims the 1930s façade) has been transformed into its new hot spot and apparently largest preservation project. The jewel-like rooms have Art Deco accents (sculptural lighting, curved paneling, pink marble), the 15,000-square-foot spa is innovative, and le tout Oslo congregates in its several buzzy bars and restaurants. The rooftop Tak Oslo serves Swedish chef Frida Ronge’s Nordic-­Japanese cuisine and has views of the elegant Frogner district, with its royal palace, parks, museums, and shops.

Want boho chic? This checks all the boxes.

Nomade Holbox

Nômade Holbox, Mexico This 30-room bolthole on Riviera Maya’s carless Holbox Island is as close as you’ll come these days to the barefoot vibe of pre-deluge Tulum. There are artfully shaped dwellings up in trees, on the sand, and amid lush foliage; natural colors and materials reign; the indoor/outdoor restaurant serves Nikkei cuisine; and the daily menu of wellness activities is extensive. Sunset kunda­lini, anyone?

A new way to see Sedona’s red rocks.

Jeff Zaruba

Ambiente, Arizona Way back in the 1920s, the red rocks of Sedona were a fixture of Hollywood films—America’s star landscape. The town’s first new luxury hotel in decades showcases them anew, with 40 cube-shaped “atriums” with floor-to-ceiling glass and rooftop decks with firepits and daybeds for 360-degree views. The furnishings are earth-tone, a trailhead connects you to 300 miles of hiking and biking routes, and—nice detail—there are in-room on-demand chilled wine dispensers, for when that sundowner feeling strikes.

Wilderness Hotels

That fresh longing for wide open spaces? It's our ancestors calling. These places keep things civilized.

A grande dame in the wilderness, reborn.

Johnne Nyborg

Hotel Union Øye, Norway There’s nothing so new, it turns out, about our infatuation with the outdoorsy nordic lifestyle. This hotel, amid the mountains of fantastically scenic Norangsfjorden, first opened to cater to the crème de la crème of European society back in 1891 (the guestlist is long and includes Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany). The property has just been refurbished by the visionary Norwegian travel company 62˚ Nord, and it masterfully walks the line between fresh and traditional, relaxed and opulent. You can bike, kayak, ski, snowshoe, wild swim, and hike (tweeds no longer de rigueur), or just be still in these magnificent surroundings. The King’s Suite has a gin-and-tonic button. Just press.

A modern remake of the western fantasy.

Andrew MacDonald

The Green O, Montana A certain aesthetic comes to mind when one envisions the Montana wilderness­ trip—call it Dutton chic. The Green O sells a different fantasy. Here, just 12 standalone glass-walled houses are scattered deep in the woods, each surrounded by nothing but towering pines. No kids are allowed, and there is just one restaurant in which to take your meals—which are excellent, by the way. This is not to say you have to forsake the quintessential American West experience entirely. The property takes up a sliver of the 37,000-acre Paws Up Ranch, which you’re free to use as your own sprawling playground.

This is Antarctica full frontal.

Andrew MacDonald

Echo Camp, Antarctica An Antarctic cruise is the new safari—everyone’s going. This camp, run by the outfitter White Desert, was founded by polar explorers Patrick and Robyn Woodhead to allow people other than scientists to experience the magic of the seventh continent. It puts you right on it for a week, via a private jet from Cape Town. The six Star Wars–­esque fiber­glass pods, plus bar and dining pods (the meals are surprisingly haute, given you’re on the moon), have floor-to-ceiling windows to better take in the surreal white world. Bespoke activities include: hiking, ice climbing, fat-tire biking, mountaineering, visiting Atka Bay’s 28,000-strong emperor penguin colony, and pushing on to the South Pole (an add-on flight). Extreme, sure, but December 2023 and early January 2024 dates are already mostly booked.

Explora El Chaltén, Argentina ­Finally, the famed Chilean outdoor hospitality brand has arrived in Argentinian Patagonia, with a world class 20-room luxe-­minimalist lodge worthy of the setting. It’s on a bend in the Río Eléctrico in the private Los Huemules Conservation Reserve—no lines of backpackers—and has staggering views of the Marconi Glacier and the jagged peaks of Mount Fitz Roy (familiar from the Patagonia clothing logo). The interiors keep it simple (so as not to clash with the beauty beyond) and what you do is hike, trek, and be continually astonished. There are 30 guided options at all levels of difficulty, a spa with hot tubs for après, and more activities coming soon.

Think of it as a new breed of African lodge.

Lolobezi

Lolebezi, Zambia The walking safari was pioneered in Zambia, which is the safari world’s less touted option—the wildlife numbers are insane, but the camps lean more four-star than five. This new lodge, right on the magnificent Zambezi River—think hippos and elephants everywhere—is a departure, with private plunge pools, a gym, and Cape Town–­level food. Another nice surprise: no ­colonial-era vibe.

Wine Hotels

Wine tourism is booming. Here are the latest stops on the grape trail.

Pace yourself! This new wine hotel means it.

Palácio Ludovice, Lisbon The city’s most important new opening has both historic charm and oenology going for it. A restored early 18th-century mansion, with the original tiles, frescoes, and stucco ceilings, it calls itself a “wine experience hotel” and lets you dive into Portuguese wines before you even get to Porto or the wine regions. The 61 rooms have copies of the wine list with recommendations; dinner at Federico, in the glass-­ceilinged courtyard, comes with wine pairings, of course. There are private curated tastings, and even (why not?) wine-inspired treatments by Caudalie at the spa.

Get your fill of Barolos and Barbarescos here.

Casa di Langa

Casa di Langa, Piedmont In case you haven’t heard, wine and food lovers (i.e., just about everyone on the planet) are increasingly looking at Italy's Piedmont. The truffles! The Barolos! Just in time comes this 39-room quasi-Scandinavian hotel on 104 acres, with vineyards and views all the way to the Alps. There are the requisite pool and spa, but also a cooking school and a wine academy, with classes and tastings several times a day. The staff is wonderfully welcoming, the service is delivered with style, and those famed wine regions are just minutes away by car.

The top stop in Spain’s fine-wine country.

Palacio de Samaniego

Palacio de Samaniego, Rioja The first hospitality project from Edmond de Rothschild Heritage outside France, this 18th-century structure in the heart of Rioja was turned into a nine-room hotel after Ariane de Rothschild fell in love with the empty building in 2016. She committed to a meticulous restoration—though the new interiors opt for an eclectic contemporary mix over period-piece atmos­phere. You’ll feel as if you’ve been invited to the home of a friend—who happens to have a world class collection of art from Indonesia and the Amazon and an enviable wine cellar.

https://electrek.co/2023/04/13/mercedes-eqs-suv-and-amg-eqe-ace-the-family-trip/,Mercedes EQS SUV and AMG EQE ace the family trip test,"During a recent family trip to Southern California, Mercedes lent us two of their flagship electric vehicles. We picked up an EQS SUV at the airport, drove it around Los Angeles and to Big Bear Mountain and back, stress testing that huge battery against elevation and high speeds. Then, to switch it up, I drove the slightly less family-friendly but more fun EQE to destinations around LA for the second half of the week. Yes, $130K cars are so much more decadent than the Hertz vehicles we’d planned for, but here are my big takeaways.

Picking up the EQS SUV from LAX, it is a relatively unassuming car (especially compared to the Red AMG EQE we’ll discuss later) that most people won’t recognize as a six-figure flagship EV. The gorgeous front plastic grille tips the hand a little bit, but otherwise, this is a very unassuming vehicle on the outside other than the Mercedes logos.

Just like the EQS Sedan I reviewed last year, the inside was gorgeous and luxurious, though it lacked the passenger dash third screen. It also lacked the Galaxy tab in the back but had most of the other accouterments, including those light massaging front seats, which would be key after a day of snowboarding. I’ll stick by my previous statements on the interior, though the SUV naturally even has more headroom:

If the inside of the EQS is anything, it is roomy. The sheer enormity of the interior is hard to put into words. Add to that the ginormous “Hyperscreen” which his really 3 screens under the same glass that spans the width of the front of the vehicle…a control screen between the 2 front seats allows those in the rear to individually control their temperature settings. What’s ironic is you don’t even have to look at the three big screens while driving because Mercedes includes one of the best heads up displays in the business. In fact, this is the first car that I preferred the built in mapping software to CarPlay/Google Maps and that’s because of the heads up integration – also it does look amazing on that huge center display.

The kids (11, 14) loved the ability to wireless charge in the armrest and adjust the back seat temperature, something they don’t get in the Chevy Bolt and Tesla Model Y they are used to at home. There’s also a ton more room in the back which almost kept them from fighting.

Probably the biggest difference is the boot, which now goes from a big EQS sedan to an even bigger SUV. That was key when it came to carrying our snowboards and equipment up the mountain.

Although we were four people on this trip, there was a third row, which I found roomy and housed our youngest during a particularly contentious part of the trip.

I climbed in the third row, and at 6 feet, 220 pounds, I felt like claustrophobia would take about 30 minutes to kick in. Even with the third row, there is plenty of room in the back for a row of groceries and even a false floor to store charging apparatus or other items.

No frunk, no hood access

The ample rear space is key here because not only does Mercedes not have a frunk, but they also don’t even allow access to the front hood area. I was curious to see where one would add the wiper fluid – it turns out there is a door on the driver’s side that you can use to do that.

It’s a bold strategy, Cotton. Let’s see if it pays off for them.

The Mercedes EQS SUV drive

Any wonderment about why someone would pay $130K for an SUV is immediately answered once you hit the road. The air suspension makes my sub-$50,000 vehicles at home feel like panel trucks. The cabin is whisper quiet even at 80mph, the turning is relatively tight, and the sub-6 second 0-60 acceleration is strong. Mercedes adds an acceleration soundtrack option which I felt compelled to try and found “not distracting.”

Mercedes, as is often the case, has a ton of varieties of the EQS SUV, and I had a middle-ish trim called 450 4MATIC. In this trim, the EPA mileage is 285 miles from the 108.4kWh battery. It was only tested on our 2.5-hour, 120-mile trip up the mountain to Big Bear. Around town, I’d seen mileage pretty closely pinned to the EPA range, but going 80mph up to 8000 feet? Let’s just say we stopped at a ChargePoint 50kW station (that put out <33kW) at dinner before our trip back.

It turns out that after regenerating most of the way down the mountain, we probably would have made the 240-mile round trip without the need for a charge, but I found myself playing it a lot safer without a garage charger waiting for me at home.

Easy street parking charging

This isn’t Mercedes-specific, but I found that it was really easy to keep these cars topped up with all of the options around town. Our Santa Monica Airbnb had street parking without access to power, but ChargePoint seemed to be everywhere, including about 20 level 2 stations at the beach where my kids surfed and a neighborhood station we topped up at over dinner a few times. Redondo Beach’s library, a few blocks from the beach/pier, also had some level 2 options that were easy and helpful. There was never any range anxiety, and I don’t even know if we lost any time because charging stations were so close to our venues and easy. I realize that Los Angeles is anything but a charging infrastructure desert, but this was the first time I’d gone 10 days without a garage charger, and it was too easy.

Switch to the AMG EQE

About midway through the week, Mercedes swapped out our EQS SUV with the AMG EQE sedan. (Yes, rough life, I know.) My wife and I had opposite reactions to the swap. Hers was, “This is worse in every way. It is smaller, [has] fewer seats, less room, has less range, it’s red, and has sports suspension.” As I’ve grown older, I’ve learned to just nod my head and sigh and save my adulation for the written word here.

At nearly the same price as the EQS SUV, the AMG variant of the EQE is gorgeous, and the “Patagonia Red metallic” color? A show stopper. We had zero people asking about the EQS SUV, whereas the AMG EQE had people visiting us at almost every stop to look and ask questions. Standout design additions are the small spoiler in the back, the pinstripe grille, fake air intakes in the front, and dope 21-inch AMG multispoke turbine wheels. I think a chrome-less version would be off the charts.

While smaller, there is still plenty of room for a family of four, and the trunk, it turns out, was surprisingly adequate at holding our three suitcases, bags, skateboards, and other souvenirs.

Inside, it is just as wild with a racing-inspired steering wheel with paddles with different racing options. When you turn the car on, it sounds like you are about to watch a THX movie and the permanent RGB light colors go from door to door.

This is a family vacation, so I didn’t get to test the 3.2 second 0-60 time, but my kids did get used to the “heads back” command before every green light. The fake motor sound here is louder and more noticeable… and fitting. Otherwise, even with the sports wheels and suspension, it is quiet and drives fantastically.

Those big shoes and 617 horsepower/701 lb-ft torque carry a huge range penalty dropping the range on the AMG EQE’s 90.6 kWH battery down from 305 miles of range in the standard edition down close to 225 miles (EPA not yet available) in the AMG variant according to the dashboard. I realize that might be a deal-breaker for some, but to Mercedes’ credit, their range is conservative.

Electrek’s Take

I wasn’t able to put these EVs through the performance paces and get into the intricate details like I would do on a normal review, but having the family along for the week presented its own nuanced tests. I’d argue that these were more telling for most than the normal speeds and feeds. And unsurprisingly, these two Mercedes vehicles passed with flying colors.

The big caveat is the price. Third-row eSUVs can be found at half the price (heck, Mercedes own EQB starts at $55K), and the slightly slower Tesla’s Model 3P and BMW’s i4 M50 are priced much lower and offer significantly more range than the AMG EQE.

That said, if you’ve got six figures to burn and want the best drives and overall vehicles possible, both of these electric vehicles worked incredibly well with my family of four. I now just have to talk my wife out of trading our Model Y for the EQS SUV.","['Seth Weintraub', 'Jameson Dow', 'Micah Toll', 'Peter Johnson', 'Tesla Model S Or X', 'Supercharging With This Link', 'Aerovironment Turbo Cord']",2023-04-13 00:00:00
https://www.wealthmanagement.com/estate-planning/pet-trusts-are-worth-trouble,Pet Trusts Are Worth the 'Trouble',"National Pet Day was Tuesday, April 12, 2023. For animal lovers, it provides a reminder to consider including pets in our estate plans, especially the use of pet trusts. Specialized pet trust law has developed because of the huge popularity of pets in this country, and the strong desire of pet owners to provide for their pets, even after the owner's death. Many trusts were established after the highly publicized example of Leona Helmsley's several-million-dollar trust for her dog, Trouble. Here is a summary of the pet laws in the various states.

The special feature of a pet trust is the same special feature of the purpose trust used in the Patagonia estate plan; they have no ascertainable beneficiaries; therefore, there's no one to enforce the trust. (Although some animal law advocates see the point differently, a pet is not legally regarded as a beneficiary, as it cannot act on its own or through a legal representative.)

The Legal Status of a Pet

Legally, pets are considered your personal property, like your car, furniture or jewelry. Without any specific plans for your pets, your heirs inherit the ownership of your pet, who may or may not be willing or able to care for your pet. If you own a pet, there are some steps you should take immediately and some longer-term planning you should consider.

Step one: Line up two friends or relatives who agree to serve as emergency and/or long-term caretakers. Provide them with the veterinarian’s name, discuss your wishes of what should happen to your pet and provide contacts for each. Discuss upfront how expenses will be covered. Stay in touch with your potential caretakers because circumstances can change over time. People move and have children, or situations may arise that impact their physical and financial ability to help manage your affairs. Having two caretakers means that you have alternatives when the situation arises.

Step two: Carry a wallet card with emergency contact information related to your animals and give the contact information to your veterinarian and your lawyer.

Planning for Pets

Planning for pets has both legal and financial considerations, in addition to deciding whether to involve the humane society or have strictly private agreements and trusts. Funds will likely be needed to cover temporary or permanent costs for your animals, including board bills and health care. Verbal promises are ambiguous in most cases, so having a trust or power of attorney in place to clarify available resources can help. Here are four options:

A living trust is a popular choice because it can be accessed immediately and is private (without probate court delays). It can be used if you become ill or incapacitated. You set aside money for care, and a named trustee has control. A trust is more flexible than a will, which takes ­effect only at death and can be a slow process.

You set aside money for care, and a named trustee has control. A trust is more flexible than a will, which takes ­effect only at death and can be a slow process. A pet trust may be included in a living trust, or as a stand-alone trust. The named trustee is given funds and guidelines/mandates as to how to administer funds for your pet and how to distribute any remaining funds when your pet dies. A pet trust is now valid in all states.

The named trustee is given funds and guidelines/mandates as to how to administer funds for your pet and how to distribute any remaining funds when your pet dies. A pet trust is now valid in all states. Power of attorney is used in the event of physical or mental incapacity, with provisions outlined for expenses, but terminates when the owner dies, unlike a trust or will. Powers of attorney are chosen when a person is alive and competent and should be part of any comprehensive estate plan. Otherwise, a disability event can result in the need for a guardian to be appointed; a lengthy process with no guarantee your pets will be covered. Name alternates, in case the initial agent is ­unable or unwilling, to serve. A power of attorney can be as broad or as narrow as you desire, so you could grant a power of attorney that has power only for specific funds for the maintenance and support of specific animals, without giving them a broad power over other assets. Also, you can appoint more than one person to hold the POA, but he POA does not go into effect until you actually give the physical paper to the person. The power of attorney can be revoked at any time; you can appoint one person and remove them and replace them with another, if you should so choose.

The power of attorney can be revoked at any time; you can appoint one person and remove them and replace them with another, if you should so choose. Life insurance is useful if you do not have sufficient property to support your animal’s care. Life insurance “creates” property when you die, which can be used to fund your pet trust.

Pet owners also have the option of putting a provision in their will for the care of their pets. Such provisions designate a caretaker and commonly set aside an amount of money with a request for the money to be used by the caretaker in the care of the pets. Pet owners can provide alternative caretakers, if the original is unable or unwilling to accept the animals and can designate temporary guardians for pets while estate issues are being settled.

Unlike a trust arrangement for the care of a pet, there is no continuing obligation for the executor under a will to see to the well-being of the pet once the administration of an estate is complete. The integrity and moral commitment of the caregiver will be your only assurance that the pet’s care will continue. Therefore, choose your primary caregiver and alternate caregiver wisely.

Consider making arrangements with a humane society, animal rescue group or animal “rest home” to take possession and care of your pet. You should review the type of care offered by each organization, its facility and staff, as well as the costs associated with that care.

Pet Protection Agreement

The Hirschfeld Pet Protection Agreement, created by Rachel Hirschfeld, is a check-the-box, fill in the blanks, legally enforceable contract between a minimum of two individuals or entities—the pet parent and the pet guardian. No attorney is required, and it is valid in every state. (Currently available through Legalzoom.com)

To care for their pets, clients should take action immediately ”just in case,” to have someone to care for them, if the client is not able to. Additionally, they should consider the alternative ways to provide for their pets, and fund that care, after the client's death.",[],2023-04-14 16:24:26+00:00
https://www.yahoo.com/news/behind-the-brand-pura-aventura-uk-pioneers-of-sustainable-travel-111450393.html,'We want to be small giants of travel',"CEO and co-founder Thomas Power floating in a lagoon near Copiapó, Chile. Photo: Pura Aventura

It was while perusing postcards in Santiago nearly 30 years ago that Thomas Power came across one of Chile’s awe-inspiring Torres del Paine National Park. “I thought, ‘Blimey, what’s that?’” says Pura Aventura’s CEO and co-founder.

Power is now fronting a business — the UK's first specialist tour operator to achieve B Corp certification — which harbours aspirations of building towards a £20m business and recruiting staff five times its current levels after the pandemic curtailed the travel industry.

Brighton-based Pura Aventura designs family, walking and nature holidays to Latin America, Spain, Portugal, and Antarctica, all with a sustainable slant stemming from Power’s time as a tour guide for US companies in the mid 90s taking high school children on educational tours across Europe.

With a “pocketful of dollars”, the now 52-year-old would spend winters in South America and even set up a cafe in Mexico. However it was Chilean Patagonia’s national park that changed his life. “I thought ‘why didn’t I know more about this place?’ It was utterly beautiful,” Power adds.

Back in the UK, Power felt he was unemployable. “I was at a low and had an unsympathetic partner. She asked what I wanted to do. I told her I wanted to take people to Chile. She said, ‘Well, do it.’”

A chance meeting and five-hour chat with a park guide, fellow co-founder Diego Martin, after missing his boat across a lake subsequently sparked Pura’s journey. “I can’t stress how ignorant I was at running a business,” admits Power. “But there is evangelical passion for Chile, Spain and Costa Rica and as you get to know the countries you have to want to share the love. That’s never shifted.

“You need a lot of resilience, ignore the no’s and push on. That’s been the secret to longevity, the energy, passion and persistence. It's much more important than me. The mission is the priority.”

Story continues

It’s a philosophy Power adapted to when he was accepted on Goldman Sachs’ 10,000 Small Businesses programme five years ago. “It was a phenomenal experience in terms of upskilling and a turbo boost for running a business,” he says. ""Many of us had been through versions of a business. Today, we are just starting Pura version four.”

The travel specialist's first version was, he admits, well intentioned. “A hobby with three guides and a similar outlook, lack of skills and bumbling along for the best part of ten years,” is Power’s recollection of the company's early years. “V2 was about concentrating on margin. V3 came after Goldman Sachs and we grew phenomenally fast.”

Then came Covid and an industry effectively banned from trading for 18 months.

“Through it all was our direct relationship to the places,” recalls Power, as the company took stock. “Yet we were always really good at producing extraordinary holidays that nobody else could copy as we were militant not to follow a path and a classic tour operator model. We weren’t a reseller of somebody’s else's product. We would never do that.

“We knew exactly how we wanted to share the places we wanted to share. It was a desire to have true control of product and experience and cut out the middle people that created complexity. Once you master that, you’re left with something unique and a reason to be in the market.

“You have to keep learning, understanding that you know sod all, keep being a sponge and absorbing it.”

This has all come amid the pound falling to a 37-year low against the dollar last September, when Pura’s margins took a 20% hit just as they opened their South America itineraries.

Despite the barriers over the last three years, Pura know that they offer unique and genuine trips, one with deep-rooted local connections and few departures every week to avoid unguarded interactions with other travellers.

In an age where travel plays a major part on social media with paid influencers, Pura rely on press, word of mouth and clients being advocates of their mission.

“You start by being consistently exceptional,” says Power. “Once people have been on our trips, they go, ‘I get it now’ and understand why it’s different.”

With the travel economy back up and running, Pura's 'scale of challenge' is growing to 30% beyond where the company was placed in 2019. Power cites Pura version four shifting from current staffing of 12 to 60 in the next few years, coupled with 40% year-on-year growth and building towards a £15-20m business.

The awe-inspiring Torres del Paine National Park

“That’s on the back of three versions of mistakes and keeping on learning. Version 4 is learning enough lessons and how much more we need to learn. That’s the exciting thing.""

As one of the first UK travel outfits to become B Corps certified, the growing membership has now rallied to a combined tune of £100m revenues within that group. “That’s impact,” says Power.

“We want to be small giants. Where we operate we go deep, rather than broad. Where we operate we have real impact.”

Business courses

“The Goldman Sachs programme was a four-month course with 30 businesses across the UK and no competing verticals. We were put through the mincer and it was effectively a condensed MBA. The resource thrown at it is unbelievable, plus you’re in a room with other business owners.

“The imposter syndrome is the one thing that connects you all. It makes you realise that I am good at marketing or abysmal at people and culture or finance. You just shine a light on it and it’s all building towards a business growth plan. It was intensely practical.

Five years later my network is still going strong and the impact and ramifications are phenomenal. I am still in a WhatsApp group and I was recently thanking them for help on a recent project.”

https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/two-centuries-of-business-leaders-who-took-a-stand-on-social-issues,Two Centuries of Business Leaders Who Took a Stand on Social Issues,"

While shareholders still reign supreme at many companies, a widespread shift toward more responsible business practices is driving more leaders to take a stand on social and environmental issues today, says Harvard Business School Professor Geoffrey Jones.



Jones predicts the recent rise of “deeply responsible businesses” will reach beyond the lens of current environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards by putting the welfare of communities ahead of maximizing profits.



“The last 10 years have seen a change in societal expectations of how business behaves.”

“A younger generation of entrepreneurs really institutionalized a deep responsibility within the [economic] system,” Jones says. “The last 10 years have seen a change in societal expectations of how business behaves. Think of the pressure on companies to pull out of Russia after the Ukraine invasion. That didn't happen a generation ago.”

Jones, the Isidor Straus Professor of Business History, explores two centuries of such ventures—and looks ahead to the future—in his new book Deeply Responsible Business: A Global History of Values-Driven Leadership. The book emerges as business executives feel increasing pressure to commit to addressing social concerns while continuing to meet investors’ profit expectations.

Two centuries of ethical capitalism

Jones chronicles two centuries of enterprises that have acted responsibly, from the 19th century British chocolate magnate George Cadbury, who helped educate and house residents of the factory town, to the 21st-century emergence of “B Corp” startups, businesses that are intended to be better for employees, communities, and the environment. Jones says the countercultural ethos associated with brands like Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and Patagonia clothing, which both advocate for the environment, has motivated business leaders to take socially responsible steps for many years.



The pioneers chronicled in his comprehensive narrative include Boston department store owner Edward Filene, who promoted credit unions and led a 1930s campaign against Nazi-era anti-Semitism; Robert Bosch, who sheltered Nazi resisters; and computer company founder An Wang, who helped revive Lowell, a small Massachusetts mill town. Jones writes that while all had their flaws, “the principles of honesty and fairness guided their actions. They perceived that there was more to life than making money and accumulating possessions.”



The rise of modern industry in 18th-century Great Britain featured what Jones calls “breathtaking examples of skullduggery and moral failure.” But he says those conditions also led to “a push for greater benevolence.” Much of it came from Cadbury and other devout 19th-century Quakers, who provided worker housing, education, and other benefits.



Repelled by England’s Dickensian poverty and inequality, Cadbury attended to his employees’ well-being. He paid their hospital bills, and built a housing development, soccer and cricket fields, a gymnasium, and an outdoor pool. (Jones grew up in Birmingham, not far from Cadbury’s factory.)



Around the same time, colonial India textile manufacturer J. N. Tata brought his Parsi and Zoroastrian spirituality to the development of what Jones describes as a 19th-century version of stakeholder capitalism. Along with an independence-minded industry, Tata envisioned a hydroelectric plant, tree plantings, and a wildlife sanctuary to improve life in the city. His son completed the project after Tata’s death. Today, the Tata Group is one of the largest and most respected corporations in India.



Three practices of responsibility

Jones says all deeply responsible ventures exemplify three practices:



They create and sell genuinely useful products and services;

They work with stakeholders with “respect and humility,” as companies that operate “within a society and not apart from it”;

And they believe in the importance of community and the role a business has in contributing to its vitality.

For many deeply responsible founders, “their religion was a huge asset,” Jones says, because it kept them from cutting financial corners. “They were in a different [ethical] game.”

Even so, not all were successful or enduring. After World War II, for example, American Motor Company CEO and future Michigan Governor George Romney tried to sell small cars to Americans as part of his belief in “modest consumerism.” But then, as now, Americans wanted big cars. When Romney left to become Governor of Michigan in 1962, the management turned to larger cars. After 1979, AMC passed successively through the hands of Renault and Chrysler and had disappeared entirely by 1990.

Plus, a smaller company’s initial social purpose can get lost when it’s acquired by large corporations that may not embody the same mission. Cadbury is now owned by the Kraft spinoff Mondelez. Consumer giant Unilever bought Ben & Jerry’s, Colgate-Palmolive bought Tom’s of Maine, and Jeff Bezos’s Amazon bought Whole Foods, which founder John Mackey had marketed as “conscious capitalism.”

‘Cool brands,’ but what about their values?

As Jones writes, such acquisitions are often made by “conventional behemoths interested in cool brands but not their associated values.” Patagonia is one of the few to escape this fate, he notes. Founder Yvon Chouinard put the company into a “purpose trust” and created a nonprofit to preserve its values. All profits go to the trust and are used to fund climate change programs and protect wildlands.



“Endless companies go to Patagonia to explore what it’s doing, whether or not they actually execute it, because it’s all very costly. ”

In an economy dominated by publicly traded companies, business leaders often find it challenging to follow Patagonia’s ambitious example, yet many still flirt with the possibility of adopting the company’s formula for purpose-driven success, Jones says.



“Endless companies go to Patagonia to explore what it’s doing, whether or not they actually execute it, because it’s all very costly,” Jones says. “But Patagonia shows that you can do it. They make quite expensive products, but high quality, so they last. And that’s clearly a way to go compared to fast fashion.”

Like earlier entrepreneurs, Jones says Chouinard thought he could inspire others to follow him on a different path “because it was the right thing to do.” But he grew disappointed at the lack of a wider impact, and a trust looked like the surest way to preserve Patagonia’s purpose.

Jones expects to see more companies creating similar trusts, partly because the pressure on conventional firms to produce short-term profits is so intense that companies may need a formal structure in place to avoid straying from their social missions.

‘It costs a lot, but it matters’

B corporation certification, or “B Corp,” is also emerging as a way to make a company’s social and environmental performance part of its legal charter and protect those values if the company is sold.

Jay Coen Gilbert, Bart Houlahan, and Andrew Kassoy—classmates at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business—launched a campaign to expand B Corp certification in 2006. That was a year after they sold AND1, a popular streetball-oriented basketball shoe and clothing brand that Gilbert had founded in 1993. (Boston Celtics player Kevin Garnett was the creative director, and numerous NBA players endorsed the brand.)

“ESG investing is based on the premise that you could get wonderful returns if companies check the boxes. ”

Based on a US Supreme Court ruling, they felt obligated to sell AND1 to the highest bidder, even though they knew the buyer would discard their social responsibility values. Rather than start another company, Gilbert and his friends started the B Lab program to get their values written into state statutes.

As of 2022, 37 states had such laws, and 5,000 B Corps were operating worldwide, including Patagonia, as well as Warby Parker, which sells eyewear.

Jones says trusts and B Corp laws reflect a little-discussed reality of deeply responsible business: “It’s expensive.” For that reason, Jones is skeptical of the popularity of ESG funds, since ESG standards are “all over the place,” with companies largely setting their own amid regulations that differ by industry and geographic area.

“ESG investing is based on the premise that you could get wonderful returns if companies check the boxes,” he says.

More important than checking boxes, Jones says, companies need to be honest and tell investors, “You know, it costs a lot, but it matters.”

The global impact of traditional tattooing and the need to end its stigma is explored in upcoming feature-documentary “Treasure of the Rice Terraces,” directed by Filipino-Canadian Kent Donguines.

The film sees Donguines embark on a journey of self-discovery and record the oral history recounted by 106-year-old Indigenous tattoo artist Apo Whang-Od, who was recently an unlikely cover star of Vogue Philippines.

The film explores how the old practises in the Kalinga region, once banned and despised in Philippine society, have now evolved into a chic and in-demand type of body art that has become a source of pride and belonging for many Filipinos. It also delves into the issues of stolen mummified bodies, cultural appropriation, stigmatization, and discrimination faced by tattooed individuals.

Now shooting in Manila and the mountainous Kalinga region, the film is directed by Donguines (“Paco,” “Kalinga”) and written by Donguines and Zlatina Pacheva (“Run the Burbs,” “Kim’s Convenience”).

“Treasure” is produced by Jacob Crawford and Bailey Wood, co-produced by Patti Lapus (“Triangle of Sadness”), Bianca Balbuena (“Singing in Graveyards”) and Grace Palicas. It is executive produced by Lars Krutak, (“Tattoo Hunter,” “Ta Stekia: Istories Agoraiou Politismou”). Cinematography is by John Fleming (“Kalinga,” “Brown Enough”) with Oswaldo Lopez Dantes (“Crescendo,” “Wallpaper,” “Petty Crimes”) as editor.

Credited production companies are Aimer Films and Crawford Filmworks. In its early stages, Treasure of the Rice Terraces was developed through HotDocs Doc Accelerator program and received development support from Rogers Group of Funds, Creative BC and Canada’s Indigenous Screen Office. Later, Knowledge Network and Canada Media Fund came on board.

“As a first-generation Filipino-Canadian, I understand the importance of identity and belonging, and the desire to reconnect with one’s roots. Growing up, tattoos were discouraged in my family, but as I became independent, I found a love for the art form and discovered deeper personal meaning behind each tattoo. I now feel secure in my identity as a Filipino because I get to carry my culture with me wherever I go,” said Donguines.

“I’ve always been fascinated by tattoos. The concept seems so simple, yet they are some of the most complex forms of artistry, with meaning and culture that goes back centuries,” said Crawford.

“The current Philippine administration is poised to let China take over the country. Never has the time been riper to interrogate our national identity,” said Lapus. “At this juncture in our history, [the rediscovery of cultural identity and national pride] has become more than a mere personal exploration, but an overt and proactive political act.”

When compiling outdoor gear guides at T3, we always try to include at least one more pocket-friendly product within the line-up of models featured. Because, let’s face it, not everyone can afford to drop £500 on a pair of boots or a waterproof jacket (especially at the moment), and not being loaded should never be a barrier to getting outside. Far from it. The countryside is free, and there’s plenty of perfectly decent and affordable kit out there, which is capable of keeping you warm and dry enough to enjoy it.

But surely, as the old cliché goes, you get what you pay for…right? Well, not necessarily. Because I have tested some truly excellent cheaper items over the years, and I’ve had very expensive kit completely fail on me. Of course it doesn’t always go that way – I’ve come across plenty of seriously sub-standard stuff at the lower end of the market too, but I have learned not judge a book/boot/whatever by its price tag alone. Budget does not automatically equal bad. And neither does cut-price necessarily mean corners have been cut.

And, here at T3, we do genuinely test all products featured on the site before reviewing them, warts and all. That means we can slice through all the marketing gumpf to see for ourselves how products really perform in a wild setting, and surprisingly regularly the more affordable options box well above their price point.

Very often, the kind of products I’m talking about here are made by one of the many homebrands produced by Decathlon. The French company manufactures a dizzyingly diverse range of sporting gear under more than 30 different category names, with the outdoor-adventure ones including Forclaz (trekking), Itiwit (paddle sports), Kalenji (running), Quechua (hiking and camping), B'Twin (cycling), Rockrider (mountain biking), Simond (climbing and mountaineering), Subea (snorkelling and diving), Inovik (cross-country skiing) and Olaian (swimming and surfing).

Without exception, equipment bearing these names will retail at a fraction of the price asked for similar garments or gear with more fashionable logos, such as Arc’teryx, Salewa, TNF or Patagonia. And yet, on test, we sometimes struggle to see much difference in the performance levels.

That said, when I’m looking at the label or webpage of a Decathlon product I’m trail testing, and I see the words ‘Designed, developed and tested in the Alps’, often accompanied by a little anecdote about the people who put the gear through its paces, I do hear my inner cynic exclaiming ‘Yeah, right…’

So, when I was offered the chance to actually go and see the company’s mountain headquarters – which, it transpires, really is in the French Alps – I leapt at it.

Decathlon’s alpine base is incorporated into one the company’s superstores – but instead of being located in some soulless suburban retail park, as we’d expect here in the UK, it’s located in Plassy, on the banks of the River Arve, in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes.

Even without looking through one of the telescopes mounted on the terrace of the roof-top restaurant and bar (yes, really), the snow-capped summit of Mont Blanc is visible among the plethora of peaks that surround the company’s mountain headquarters. Suffice to say, it’s impressive – if this setting doesn’t inspire you to get outside and do something, then you’re a lost cause.

Meeting the employees was the next revelation. Frankly, I was expecting the sort of service you get in a Sports Direct store. You know what I mean. But instead I found staff who were knowledgeable, engaged and genuinely enthusiastic about the outdoors. It helps that company policy is to give everyone a two-hour lunch, so they can get out and go for a run, ride, walk or ski in daylight hours during their break.

Keen to explore more, I was given a tour of the store and the wider building. Beneath and to the side of the enormous shop floor are the design spaces, open-plan offices and testing areas where everything from waterproof jackets and tents to backpacks, hiking boots, head torches, snowboards, climbing gear and cross-country skis are conceived, conceptualized, brought to life and then stress tested.

Intrigued, I wanted to know more about the technical tests, and soon let myself in for more than I’d bargained for. A product specialist for Forclaz told me that, while the fabrics and materials used in Decathlon’s tents and technical apparel are subjected to hydrostatic head tests, such assessments can be misleading, since they don’t reflect the waterproof performance of the seams, zips and other parts of the build. So, Decathlon also put all their gear through a bespoke testing process, which more accurately assesses a shelter or garment’s protective properties.

For tents, this happens in a special room in a nearby building, where each product is pitched and then subjected to a simulated torrential downpour for long periods of time. I was taken to see this process in action, and then invited to experience the whole thing at very close quarters – from inside the tents being tested.

And that’s how I ended up spending my time in the gorgeous Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, sat inside a minimalist MT900 Forclaz backpacking tent that was being relentlessly pounded by industrial sprinklers. (For all Decathlon-brand products, the higher the MT number, the more technical the product is.)

Also in the testing room was a Quechua 2-second pop-up tent, a brilliant design (recently given a 5-star review on T3) that allows you to pitch the tent instantly by opening the whole thing up like an umbrella. It was invented by one of Decathlon’s product designers right here in the mountain HQ, after he’d returned from a camping trip with his young son, who had suggested the idea. Obviously, I had to give that a test from the inside too. And, happily, not a drop of water got through the flysheets of either tent, so I stayed nice and dry.

After the first round of technical testing, Decathlon get the prototype gear out to an army of volunteer field testers, who take it camping, hiking, trekking, skiing and so on, for several weeks. Once they report back, tweaks and more extensive alterations are made to the design according to the testers’ comments, before products go into production proper.

Impressively, it’s not just the tent itself that’s subjected to testing. In the basement of the building, I met another team who look after the packaging and paperwork. They took me to an area where my mission was to pitch a 2-person dome tent using the instructions that had been drawn up to accompany the product.

I was instructed to make notes if anything was unclear or confusing. This is a process all Quechua and Forclaz tents go through, too, in order to make sure people can easily use the products in the field.

Next I got to meet the individual brand managers and design gurus for each category, who explained the lengths they go to in order to reduce the environmental impact of the gear they make. This includes pioneering a whole range of backpacking and camping kit – including tents and sleeping bags – where no dye has been used whatsoever. (Watch this space for a UK-product test of these items.)

A big emphasis is placed on getting the most out of existing kit. Decathlon offer a repair and part-replacement service in their stores, so just because an item is relatively cheap, you shouldn’t simply bin it if its performance drops – take it in and get it rejuvenated. Somewhat surprisingly (given the low price of many products in the first place), they also offer (and honour) a two-year warrantee on almost everything, so if kit legitimately fails within that time frame, you can just get it replaced.

One last tip for the real bargain hunters out there – it’s worth perusing Decathlon’s website for ‘Secondlife’ items, which have either been tested by media or returned by customer very quickly, and can’t be sold as new – you can pick good gear for a great price here.

So, the gear truly is designed and tested in the Alps. I’ve seen it happen, and joined in with the process. And the design teams are genuinely passionate about both improving the longevity of the equipment and making the manufacturing process as eco-friendly as possible. But what about the working conditions in the overseas factories?

At the risk of raising eyebrows, I had to ask – there are so many horror stories out there about sweatshops, especially associated with cheaper-priced products. I’m happy to report, there was no attempt to dodge my question. Two brand managers sought me out and spoke at length about how they have people permanently on site in all the manufacturing hubs – found in various locations, including China and Bangladesh – to ensure ethical production policies are in place. (For the record, I can’t verify this personally, having not visited the factories, but the issue was certainly taken seriously and addressed well, and it should also be noted that most, if not all, premium-priced outdoor brands such as Arc’teryx, TNF, Salewa and so on, also manufacture their gear in locations across Asia.)

Suffice to say, by the end of the day, my inner cynic had been fairly well silenced and put in his place. I already knew the gear performed well – I’ve tested plenty of Decathlon products in the past – but now I know exactly where it originates from, how the creative process works, and what rigours it’s put through before it hits shelves – and frankly it’s impressive.",[],

The Impact of Covid-19 and Russia-Ukraine War on Community Health Systems EHR Market

The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Covid-19 pandemic have significantly impacted the Community Health Systems EHR market.

How We Test Checked Luggage

Every luggage test we do follows a consistent and rigorous methodology. We start by interviewing relevant experts in the industry — manufacturers, products designers, brand reps, and even pilots and flight attendants — to get their take on what to look for in luggage. Using those expert tips, we then do extensive internet research to find the top rated luggage items on the market, taking into consideration a variety of brands and price points, and we purchase those for our tests.

During testing, we start by noting any initial observations we like or don't like about it, such as any useful features that stand out, the style and aesthetic, and more. Then, we weigh and measure each bag — every ounce counts when it could save you money in overweight baggage fees, especially with checked luggage! Next, we pack the suitcases with clothing, shoes, toiletries, cosmetics, and a few breakable souvenirs to evaluate the capacity and organizational features of the suitcase. Then, to test how well they maneuver, we roll them across various surfaces, such as concrete floors, carpet, and cobblestone streets. Lastly, we test their durability by throwing them off of high surfaces and striking them with baseball bats to mimic the damage a bag might receive once it leaves your hands and is thrust from conveyer belt to cargo hold and more.

At the end, we analyze all insights and data to recommend the best products for your trip. Only when we decide we really love a product (and that it offers value for your money) do we recommend it to you.

Music, videos, presentations and discussions will fill two and a half days of learning about climate change. Events are free, open to the public and in-person, with a virtual streaming option available.

Hannah Wood is the interim associate director of operations and programs at CU Boulder and helped organize the conference. She said 88 speakers, local and national, will highlight different aspects and perspectives on climate change.

""There's no more urgent local issue right now than climate change, and we felt that that was really important to highlight this year,"" Wood said.

She said this year's CWA will cover climate change through many lenses, including the arts, business, science and technology. She also said it will focus on many different perspectives, including discussions on climate anxiety, positive topics and solutions.

The event will feature two keynote speakers, environmental photographer, videographer and CU Alum James Balog and former Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario.

Balog, who is known for his work documenting the human impact on nature, will talk about the environmental damage he has captured and how people can help from 3 to 4:30 pm Wednesday, at Macky Auditorium.

Balog said attendees will see excerpts from films and more than 100 still life photos, including images of endangered wildlife, America's oldest trees, wildfires and work done on retreating glaciers and sea level rise.

""It's going to frame the entire conference,"" Balog said. ""It provides the broad context that the rest of the conference will dig into, it provides context in a captivating visual way.""

The second keynote speaker is former Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario, who will discuss the impact corporations have on the planet. Chancellor Philip DiStefano will join Marcario to facilitate a discussion from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. Thursday, also at Macky.

The conversation is on leadership in the age of climate change, and the two will discuss a range of topics about the role of businesses in climate policy, the need for action and practical examples of action businesses can take.

""Though the situation we face is complex and dire, there is much good work to do to reverse and mitigate the damage caused by the climate crisis and business has an important role to play,"" Marcario said. ""I hope people we walk away inspired to act.""

Balog said he hopes those who attend find ""inspiration"" and ""a new way of thinking about their lives and the world.""

Two thousand people are registered for the conference and expected to attend in person, Wood said. To register, see the full schedule of events and for more information, visit colorado.edu/cwa/.

Sheri Tingey told her story to producer Sarah Vitak for an episode of The Daily Rally podcast. It has been edited for length and clarity.

Then I got really sick. I couldn’t crawl across the floor. And I just kept thinking, Is this my life? I will never design again. All of this life was over.

I am here in Mancos, Colorado. It’s one of those one stoplight towns when you drive through, like, Oh, did I pass this place? It’s a very eclectic mix of people.

I was sewing by five. By about the second grade, I got the hand me downs, and oh my God, I hated them. I would just take scissors and chop it all up, and I’d walk out the door. By about the fifth grade, I was making all of my clothing.

As a young child, I had terrible tourettes. I was dyslexic. I was all of these things. But that also gave me my window that I created through other ways. For me, it was fabrics and the outdoors. That became my lifelong love.

I fell in love with skiing and moved to Jackson Hole. I was a horrible waitress. I couldn’t do any of those things, and I started making ski clothing, just because I wanted something to wear, and I hated what was out there. That really started my first business. It just absolutely lit every candle that mattered to me.

During that time, I had also discovered kayaking. The minute I got it in a boat it was like, You’re home, girl. This, this is you, this is it. It’s everything that I had ever loved about the water. So I would spend the winter skiing and the summers kayaking. I would be on the first tram and would ski until three in the afternoon, and I would sew until midnight. In the summer, it was the same. I was kayaking all day. I ran 24-7. I never knew how to shut off those things.

Jackson Hole in those days was a real hotbed of outdoor design. I was probably the first one out there that was making really practical clothing. Doug Tompkins was there, John Simms from Simms Fishing. Yvon Chouinard lived there; he had the climbing business and then he started the clothing.

Teton Mountaineering was the main mountaineering shop there in Jackson. I remember so distinctly, they had a celebration when this Patagonia catalog came out. I remember, I looked at it and a couple other people that were small little guys like me looked at it, and we went, We’re dead. This is it.

And it did happen that way. All of a sudden Patagonia went, and here came the North Face, and here came the others. And they got bigger and bigger and bolder, and all the little guys disappeared.

Then I got really sick. I’d had this flu, maybe two and a half weeks. I thought, I’m okay. And [my partner] Ralph and I went out to climb a thing called Irene’s Arete in the Tetons.

It’s about a 4,000-foot ascent up to the base of the climb, and then a 13-pitch climb. And that’s when the viral pneumonia came in. The next day, I was down, and I was down for two and a half months. Then the chronic fatigue came in.

I mean, I was on my hands and knees. It also had this component of your brain kind of going out the window. It was just this terrifying, horrifying thing and nobody could help me. I go to doctors and they just say, “Well, go home and take an aspirin, because tests don’t show anything.” Within two months, I had to give up my business and skiing and boating and all these things. It all just left.

[My son] Thor was two at the time. I had nobody to watch him. I’d just lay on the floor, and he’d crawl over me. And I just kept thinking, Is this my life?

The chronic fatigue would ebb and flow and ebb and flow. You’d have years where you do work better and years where you just didn’t function. You wish you were dead, but you’re not gonna die from it.

Then we moved to Alaska. We had this good size dog team, which I could do because I could control the amount of energy I put out. Hop in the sled and the dogs take you.

Clothing was really junky for mushers. I could make something better. But I had to ask, Do I have the energy? When I was first sick, I couldn’t sew for 15 minutes. I would be so exhausted. Anybody that has ever dealt with chronic fatigue, knows if you either overdo yourself physically or mentally, you’ll crash, and you can crash for a day, or weeks, or months. Ten years in, that was probably the hardest thing I ever did, retraining myself how to recreate without exhausting myself, because it went so against everything in my personality. Whether it was skiing or kayaking or working on an art project, it was 24-7 until I crashed.

It was like, No, you’re gonna sew for 15 minutes and then you’re gonna walk away. Now you’re gonna sew for 30 minutes, you’re gonna walk away. You need to put it away at night and pick it up again.

Dr. Denton at Alaska Alternative Medicine Center saved my life. She said, “You were 17 years getting in here, plan on at least 12 getting out, because you can’t go out too fast. You’ll fall down.” She was right. And my energy came back.

Within a year of that, Thor walked through the door with this dead boat from these trips that he’d done. And he asked me, “Can you build me a boat?”

Pack rafts are boats designed to fit into a backpack. Building a pack raft is much closer to making clothing than it is to making boats. It really is a sewing technology.

You talk about times in your life when light bulbs go off. It was like, This is everything that I’ve ever cared about. All that I thought I had lost, and all that I thought was useless, just absolutely came and jumped in the basket. It was like the door just opened and said, “Walk.”

I could never have run or become Alpacka had I not done that. I needed those years to retool myself to do what eventually came out to be that this is what you’re gonna do, girl.

I used to run the whole business, and thankfully now I don’t have to. I just design boats. I’m back in that element that I really care about, that it all comes down to, How good of a boat can you make? Not how beautiful a boat, but what’s the best boat you can come up with? And that’s way more interesting to my soul and to how I work.

I am so blessed to have had that second chance. If that had come ten years earlier, I would have still been too sick to do anything about it. And this time around is so much more enjoyable than the first time.

https://www.bustle.com/wellness/soft-hiking-tiktok,"""Soft Hiking"" Is Taking Off On TikTok","There are two types of people in this world: those who enjoy a 10-mile trek up a steep incline with the goal of getting to the top of a mountain as quickly as possible, and those who prefer something a little more chill. If you fall into the latter category, soft hiking is for you.

Soft hiking was coined by Lucy and Emily of @softgirlswhohike on TikTok. Their mission? To show the world that hiking doesn’t have to be hard. In fact, it can be soft. If you want to stroll through the woods, stop to look at the scenery, pause for snacks — or just take your new Patagonia fleece for a spin in the park — it all counts as hiking, even though it doesn’t involve scrambling or buckets of sweat.

The original post about soft hiking already has over 340,000 views, as well as comments that show just how much the trend strikes a chord. One person wrote “Love this! I’ve wanted to get more into hiking but I prefer going at my own pace” and another said, “No I actually love this as I love a sunny day walk but hate hills.” So real.

While seasoned hikers might look for a challenging trek, soft hiking — a term that now has over 120 million views on TikTok — is all about slowing down, breathing the air, and meandering through nature.

In their video, Emily and Lucy note that they’ve been out on the trails with seasoned hikers in the past, but worried the whole time that they weren’t strong or fast enough to keep up with the expected pace. After going on more traditional hikes, they realized they had different motivations. While one person wanted to crush a sweaty, steep hike on a Saturday morning, they just wanted to go outside and ramble around.

By leaning into soft hiking, they’ve learned that they’re capable hikers, too... just in a different way. They don’t push themselves to the limit or try to reach a certain goal — like hitting a summit or walking a certain amount of miles — while out on a trek. Instead, they revel in nature and enjoy the stroll outdoors. And that’s still super beneficial.

The key to soft hiking is to go slow, take in your surroundings, and stop for regular water and snack breaks. You should feel free to go off trail to look at a cool tree, pull over at an overlook to take photos, explore a historical site — or whatever else strikes your fancy. There’s no need to rush or push or keep up with others. As long as you’re present and having fun, you’re doing it right.

Soft hiking is taking off on TikTok likely because it fits right in with lazy girl workouts, at-home walking workouts, and other trends that allow anyone to exercise and get moving, even if they don’t have a high level of fitness, a ton of gear, or a gym membership. Welcome to the soft workout era, y’all.",[],
https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/young-people-sick-working-hard-053000139.html,Young people are sick of working hard for no money – and are using social media to vent,"‘Gone are the days of being ‘perfect’ on social media. People want to see authenticity; they want creators to keep it real,’ says career coach Sho Dewan (TikTok/iStock)

Pizza Fridays. Bring-your-dog-to-work days. Away days in an escape room. All are well-known ploys the managerial class use to massage a docile workforce despite real-term pay cuts. And yet, we still bite. In fact, you might be reading this after working overtime for the umpteenth day this month, believing – hoping – it warrants more than limited career growth and a Christmas party budget that covers only the first round. Bad news, it might not.

But don’t fret, for no one is fooling today’s young nine-to-fivers, who now find their balm to a bad day at the office or a marathon of aimless Zoom calls in the world of Corporate TikTok. Here, content creators rant, rave and spill the beans on toxic employer habits, offering you hacks and tips for everything from workplace red flags to the real meaning of a performance improvement plan (spoiler: you’re getting sacked). Some creators even go as far as filming their resignation process in videos known as “Quit-Toks”.

Rising from the ashes of a pandemic and the advent of hybrid working, young professionals are rejecting the old guard’s workplace ideology, conscious of the inflation and cost of living crisis looming above our heads regardless. Tackling phenomena like the Great Resignation, “quiet quitting” and “over-employment”, TikTokers are using these buzzwords as cannon fodder, critiquing the faceless monoliths of modern work. Forget collegiate camaraderie; now, the white-collar and Patagonia-gileted worker wants their job to feel valuable for them. Naturally, TikTok, a platform that embraces low-fi, serendipitous videos where users wear their hearts on their sleeves, has become the hub to rock the boss’s boat.

“Gone are the days of being ‘perfect’ on social media,” says Sho Dewan, the career coach behind the @workhap TikTok. “People want to see authenticity; they want creators to keep it real.” Indeed, this former recruiter and HR professional uses his past experience to share quick, consumable corporate cheat codes, helping prospective applicants fill vacancies and employees avoid scrapes with their employers. Titling his clips with clickbait like “Never share this to HR” and “The truth about salary negotiations”, Dewan provides truly insightful advice that many would be afraid to voice.

Story continues

But this is just the tip of the iceberg. Elsewhere, many content creators cater their advice to specific demographics. Stephen Adeoye, a former corporate employee, runs the @corporatesteve TikTok as well as a recruitment agency, Beyond Education, focused on underrepresented talent in the finance and technology sectors. His account uses comedic dubs spliced with earnest commentary, pointing Black candidates to opportunities, one example being an “equality internship”. However, his approach is twofold, criticising the practice of diversity hiring as a back-handed compliment. In one clip, he opens it with the statement, “Guys, being a ‘diversity hire’ ain’t it”, before correcting himself: “Sike, it’s lit.” His position is undeniably a confusing one. His entrenchment in corporate philosophy also betrays itself in one particular clip, in which he uses a McKinsey study to back up the importance of having racially diverse teams to increase EBIT, or earnings before interest and tax.

So, what is the overarching objective? “There is a lack of transparency regarding what occurs in popular corporate industries and how to break into them,” he explains. “Ultimately, TikTok offers a space for people to gain valuable insights and experiences of the corporate world.” It’s laudable, as are his vocal thoughts on internal corporate problems – attending Thursday drinks to get promoted, for example – but overall, his is a less critical view. Indeed, studies on the benefits of a four-day working week don’t convince Adeoye, and while he’s aware of systemic racism in workplaces, he advocates against “playing the victim”.

As young people encounter more needless systematic bureaucracy, they will continue to instinctively share and call out stupid corporate behaviour

Connor Blakley, CEO of YouthLogic

Conversely, some TikTokers want to upend the system wholly, rejecting the Protestant ethic of working hard regardless of the yield – let alone institutional discrimination. In one clip that went viral, Gabrielle Judge (@gabrielle_judge), the self-proclaimed “Anti Work Girlboss”, shares a screenshotted forum thread in which one user shares his experience of being caught using a “mouse jiggler” – this is software that makes it appear as if remote workers are still active and online, all the while they could be travelling the world or working another job. “What’s your thoughts,” she asks her followers. “Should he be fired?” Below the video, her caption reads: “Is his employer overbearing or did he mess up? #techlayoffs #overemployed #programming.” According to Judge, this clip was not intended to encourage such behaviour but rather to start a conversation. “Is there an oversaturation of job types that aren’t needed for a full 40-hour week role, or did people give up on their career?” she says. “That’s just one example of how I use dramatic ideas to challenge what needs to change for the future.”

Judge’s content speaks to a phenomenon the late ethnographer David Graeber wrote about in Bulls*** Jobs (2018), a book centred on the premise that myriad jobs have little to no social value and even their holders cannot justify the profession’s existence. For Graeber, these play a key role in the glut of unnecessary work that prevents economist John Maynard Keynes’ prediction of a 15-hour working week coming true. While most corporate TikTokers rarely adopt such strong views, it’s not uncommon to see them toying with diluted versions, nitpicking the time-wasting bureaucracies endemic to many corporate roles.

Henry Nelson-Case, or @thatcorporatelawyer as he’s known on TikTok, uses his videos as tongue-in-cheek jibes at outdated practice. From the pointless requests to “jump on a call” when it could just be an email, to running errands in work hours, his sketches are not about the redundancy of corporate jobs in themselves, but instead changes that companies could make. “Contrary to a lot of the comments I get on TikTok, I am actually a fully qualified lawyer and work hard,” he tells me. “I’m not always swanning the supermarkets or going on walks at 11am. I think the key point is that there is a real shift in how we work and prioritise our time, especially post-pandemic. The traditional nine-to-six working day is not always the most productive way of working for many.”

To Nelson-Case’s point, salaried jobs can go through quiet periods, when perhaps a kinder manager might let you clock off early, or busy periods, when every second counts and idle small talk falls by the wayside. If working conditions are to match this, that means customising them to the person who would prefer to blitz their work in the first few days of the week and the person who likes to amble along, peppering their day with catch-ups, coffee and cake.

The latter finds its hellish pinnacle in one clip by Abi Clarke (@abiclarkecomedy), where characters Jill and Tracey get trapped in an endless loop of office niceties, going back and forth with “Morning! Good, you?” ad infinitum. It makes funny viewing but does pose the existential question of how many working hours we spend actually grafting and how many involve listening to Carol from marketing divulge every inane detail of her weekend. Private sector? Efficient? Not quite.

And it shows. Hot on the heels of the economic downturn – as well as consistently failed promises that working hard, going to university and biding your time pays off – many young people would rather cut the crap, all too aware that middle-class martyrdom is just that. “By this point, our BS-meter is almost inherent,” says Connor Blakley, CEO of YouthLogic, a Gen-Z-led marketing agency. “As young people encounter more needless systematic bureaucracy, they will continue to instinctively share and call out stupid corporate behaviour.”

‘The traditional nine-to-six working day is not always the most productive way of working for many,’ says lawyer Henry Nelson-Case (iStock)

Some would call them snowflakes, but this desire for work to work for you is admirable. Sara Bimo, a doctoral researcher at York University in Toronto, says she’s observed an exceptional awareness of labour exploitation and its bureaucratic cloaks among millennial and zoomer generations. “[It] can manifest as a mixture of pessimism and absurdism surrounding the infrastructures of daily corporate life,” she says. “[It] allows these workers to deconstruct and, thus, render meaningless structures of corporate control.”

Granted, this particular jostle with corporate culture wasn’t the revolution Karl Marx envisioned, but it’s still a form of worker resistance, one that does the best it can with its native means. As it goes, TikTok users are often aware of its flaws and pay heed to these. For Goldsmiths University doctoral researcher Andreas Schellewald, he recognises that the trend could encourage employees to use hacks to manage the workplace, inadvertently placing the responsibility on themselves rather than encouraging a radical rethink. “But at the same time, if you look at the wider debates, I feel that this is more a phenomenon tied to a growing demand for systemic change of our work culture,” he adds. There you have it. The revolution will not be televised, but it will be TikTok-ed.",['Joseph Bobowicz'],

https://www.chicagobusiness.com/restaurants/chicago-restaurant-group-behind-rose-mary-opening-new-fulton-market-spot,Restaurant group behind Rose Mary to open new Fulton Market spot,"The new spot will be about two blocks west of Rose Mary.

""Things are starting to move west in Fulton Market, and down Fulton Street,"" Callero said. ""Given the projects that are planned or in process on that street, we think there's going to be a lot of activity there.""

Sancerre's upcoming restaurant will occupy the entire first floor of the building, which is being called 1045 On Fulton. Developer Fulton Street Cos. and asset manager Intercontinental Real Estate are developing the building. The 12-story office building is about 30% leased, and Fulton Street CEO Alex Najem said more deals are in the works. The building signed law firm Norton Rose Fulbright as its first tenant last year.

The restaurant will have about 3,000 square feet of outdoor space and 150 feet of frontage along Fulton Street. The building is also surrounded by residential developments, and those tenants will need places to eat.

""If you were to come and look at this site today, there are six cranes up right now and they're all residential buildings,"" Najem said, speaking on the phone from the building. ""It's kind of wild.""

Fulton Street Cos., founded in 2017, focuses on Fulton Market. It previously led the redevelopment of a building at 1100 W. Fulton St. for furniture company Herman Miller.

Najem said apparel companies are also starting to move into the area, with Fjallraven recently signing a lease at 1101 W. Fulton St. — which Fulton Street Cos. also developed — and Patagonia opening at 1115 W. Fulton. Healthy retail corridors usually have a mix of restaurants, where people can refuel on their shopping trips.

""We think it's smart to add a restaurant, specifically a larger restaurant that will have lunch and day and nighttime foot traffic, to help the retail out,"" Najem said. ""We're hoping to fill the gap and provide both high-quality restaurants and retail.""

This is the first time Sancerre Hospitality has worked with Fulton Street Cos. Sancerre's flagship restaurant is BLVD Steakhouse, which opened in the West Loop in 2017. Rose Mary opened in 2021 at 932 W. Fulton St. It serves Adriatic food and has maintained its buzz two years into operation.

Flamm, who is culinary director and partner at Sancerre, was executive chef at now-closed Michelin-starred Spiaggia. He was also a protege of Girl & the Goat's Stephanie Izard, and he won a season of ""Top Chef.""

Intercontinental, which backed the development of an office building at 1045 W. Fulton St., also has been a prominent investor in the neighborhood as it has grown from food wholesalers into a hub of offices and upscale restaurants. The firm paid more than $50 million in 2019 for the seven-story office building at 811 W. Fulton St., which at the time was the priciest purchase of a Chicago office building on a per-square-foot basis.

Sancerre's restaurant will round out 1045 On Fulton's amenities for its office tenants, Joseph Sweeney, Intercontinental's senior director of asset management, said in a news release.",['Ally Marotti'],2023-04-12 08:51:45-05:00
https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/chain-reaction-trove-andy-ruben-120318961.html,Chain Reaction: Trove’s Andy Ruben on How Resale Can Help Improve Supply Chain Logistics,"Click here to read the full article.

Chain Reaction is Sourcing Journal’s discussion series with industry executives to get their take on today’s logistics challenges and learn about ways their company is working to keep the flow of goods moving. Here, Andy Ruben, founder and executive chairman at Trove, discusses how the company is helping brands and retailers looking to expand their offerings into resale with its technology.

Andy Ruben, founder and executive chairman, Trove

Name: Andy Ruben

Title: Founder and Executive Chairman

Company: Trove

What is Trove’s latest initiative?

Trove is the market leader in branded resale for world-class brands like Allbirds, Arc’teryx, Canada Goose, Carhartt, Levi’s, Lululemon, Patagonia, REI and more. Additionally, we power brands with scale, profit and customer experience through our Recommerce Operating System, which unlocks pricing and merchandising for millions of unique items with insights to optimize every part of the circular journey.

Most recently, we launched Trove’s inaugural Brand Resale Index: Defining the Resale Experience. The Index evaluated over 40 brands in four industry verticals—fashion/apparel, outdoor, footwear and luxury—with resale programs across 142 criteria to ID best practices for other brands to emulate. The Index is the first report of its kind and was created as a guide of best practices so that more brands can activate a successful resale program.

What are the main things brands and retailers could do (or stop doing) right now that would immediately improve logistics?

Many retailers have dramatically expanded assortment and returns without the instrumentation in place to understand and correct return on investment (ROI) of items. Resale, which includes returns that cannot be sold new, can be a good starting point for brands with excess inventory. While this isn’t the end goal, it’s a great place to start.

When it comes to creating efficiencies, there are quick wins and longer plays. What is something your company is doing to help its partners succeed on both fronts?

Trove isn’t interested in brands looking for quick-hit marketing programs. We work with brands who understand the strategic nature of resale and staying connected to every product made and sold and, thereby, every brand customer.

Story continues

We build programs that start with small steps but are always in line with the retailer’s longer-term vision. This allows our brand partners to make money now as they are prepared for what we see as inevitable changes in the way we shop.

What is your company doing to make the movement of goods more sustainable?

Fashion is said to be the second-most-polluting industry in the world, right behind the oil industry—and while resale programs can shift from new product revenue to existing product revenue, not all resale programs are sustainable.

After years of leading sustainability at Walmart, I was inspired to start Trove to figure out how brands could grow their business without net new production. We are accelerating the shift toward more sustainable, circular business models, helping to keep goods out of landfills and reduce waste. We processed 1.5 million items in the last year, preventing a huge number of products from needing to be sourced, produced and shipped.

Additionally, in 2022, we saved 1.5 million kilograms of CO 2 through branded resale and trade-in programs powered by our Recommerce Operating System, a system that powers trade-in and resale for fashion brands, delivering sustainable and profitable growth at scale.

When it comes to supply chain logistics challenges, there are things companies can fix, and things that are beyond their control. How can the former help the latter?

Nobody has a crystal ball—beyond “black swans” like Covid-19, it’s very difficult to predict changes in gas prices, interest rates, savings rates, global economic events, etc., affecting customer demand.

What brands can do is be more aware and more dynamic about where inventory is in the supply chain and how to reallocate it given the macro events.

What is the one thing brands and retailers could be doing to make better use of technology to improve logistics?

One thing brands and retailers could be doing is dedicating more technology and intelligence to reverse logistics. Returns and reverse logistics have been under-invested for years, and given shifts in e-commerce and expanded assortment, the inefficiencies are becoming material.

Resale is here, and Trove is leading the resale revolution with scalable branded solutions—like our Recommerce Operating System—that extend the life of millions of products, creating more inclusive, less wasteful business models.",['Andre Claudio'],

© Provided by GearJunkie Deuter Cabezon Series

Deuter is no stranger to making good bags. With a storied lineup of German-engineered hiking backpacks, the company's signature clean lines and no-fuss aesthetic are a common sight on day and thru-hikers alike.

The brand took its first foray into the bikepacking space this spring with the Cabezon series. How do decades of bag-making experience translate across disciplines? I put the bags through 200+ miles of testing, from errand commutes to overnight campouts, on the tarmac, gravel roads, and single track, in order to find out.

In short: The Deuter Cabezon bags are lightweight, spacious, fully waterproof, and elegant in their simplicity. The frame bag and handlebar bag stand out as the top performers. They hit the right blend of minimal features for maximum benefits. The saddlebag, while effective, could benefit from more secure attachment points to reduce sway on single track and high-effort climbs.

Deuter Cabezon Bags Review

The Deuter Cabezon series consists of four pieces: the Cabezon Handlebar Bag 14 ($130), Cabezon Saddle Bag 16 ($140), Cabezon Frame Bag 4 ($105), and the Cabezon Frame Bag 6 ($115).

Each pack is waterproof and built from hard-wearing 220-denier polyamide and 600-denier polyester, and has taped and welded seams, as well as TPU-coated zippers. The handlebar bag and the saddle bag are each two-part systems consisting of a harness and detachable bike dry bag. This makes them handy for unpacking around the campsite but less suited for making adjustments on the bike on the fly.

Each bag comes in two color options, a sleek dark slate blue and a desert-inspired tan.

4L and 6L Frame Bags

The Deuter Cabezon frame bags are no-frills, consisting of one dry-bag-like main compartment, a TPU zipper, and four straps to secure it to the frame. The top of each bag contains modular adjustment points, allowing you to move the straps to better fit the length of your top tube.

The main compartment is essentially a peculiar-shaped drybag, having little substance on its own. It relies on the bike's geometry and the weight of the gear to provide shape. I'll confess that while I installed the bag, I was skeptical of its efficacy. I usually prefer a more structured bag like Revelate Designs Tangle Frame Bag or Oveja Negra's ½ Pack.

But, my initial skepticism disappeared after testing. Simply put, this bag can fit a lot. It's the bikepacking equivalent of Patagonia's favored Black Hole duffel. This is a ludicrously capacious bag, to quote an internet joke I'm certainly weeks too late on.

On long training rides, it easily handled a pump, spare layers, tool roll, and plenty of snacks. It swallowed a hefty hardcover book on an errand ride to the post office. And kept it bone dry in a Michigan spring downpour, no easy feat. And it loaded well with a stove, fuel, and other heavy essentials for the overnight test.

When stuffed to capacity, the frame bag tended to run wide, which didn't bother me on my bike. But when my wife strapped the smaller 4L frame bag onto her Canyon Grizl 54cm frame, she had to adjust her riding to keep her knee from rubbing the pack. Part of this is just the struggle that riders with smaller bikes face across any bag setup, but it's worth noting.

Also, the lack of internal pockets can lead to items sliding around without proper organization.

14L Handlebar Bag

The Handlebar bag was the standout success of the collection for me. In the past, I've used various styles of handlebar bags and found none that hit the sweet spot of fitting onto my drop bars yet having enough capacity to be worth the wind drag and sacrificed hand positioning. The Cabezon stepped right up into that gap.

The 14L drybag has dual roll-top openings and a valve to bleed the air out, ensuring a compact and streamlined pack. It had enough capacity to fit my current bikepacking tent, the Sea to Summit's Telos 2. It fit in its entirety, and there would have been room to add extra gear alongside if needed.

The harness hit an optimal ratio of rigidity and flexibility. I didn't lose an undue amount of balance or have to manhandle my bars around curves, and it handled the Telos' weight with stoic impressiveness.

It barely shifted over a deadly combination of Michigan gravel road potholes and twisty local singletrack. And the harness's bungee strap was impressively tight, holding gloves, energy waffles, and briefly, valued sunglasses.

The installation process was straightforward, though Deuter does have overview videos on the site. The foam spacers are meaty and helpful for those who prefer extra real estate for their hands, as I do. And the simplicity-to-effectiveness ratio of the straps hits the Goldilocks zone. It was a no-fuss Velcro installation that held true despite the terrain and realistic weight inside.

16L Saddle Bag

The saddlebag is also a two-part system consisting of a harness and a dry bag. The harness threads through the saddle rails and closes with a buckle, cinching and adjusting tension through the lower harness. It also has a large Velcro strap that attaches to the seat post, with segments of fabric that overlap or sandwich the seat post.

The harness is the piece I had the most trouble with. While I enjoyed the tool-free installation, it wasn't worth the tradeoff of security. I appreciate the security that comes with systems like Ortlieb's comparable Seat Pack or Revelate's Spinelock.

The (literal) rub was the fixed points on the top of the harness that threaded through the saddle rails. Even with maximum tension from the bottom of the harness, there was wiggle due to the fixed top straps. While we're talking centimeters, not inches, I still would have loved to crank the tension there.

Although I never worried the bag would fall off, it had an uncomfortable sway during standing efforts on big climbs or root-filled single-track. This did not affect performance but made me think about wasted effort counteracting the bag’s motion. And, I was annoyed feeling weight shifts when requiring optimum focus.

The bag’s external bungee also performed well.

Like all saddlebag dry bags, the drybag is tapered in shape to fit the harness. This tapered shape is the unique challenge of all saddlebags or seat post bags. The dry bag has to fit within the prescribed space but still be useful.

I found that the Cabezon's drybag, with its valve for bleeding out air, was as spacious as the rest of the collection. It easily swallowed my current sleep setup - Sea to Summit's Spark II Sleeping Bag and Ether Light Sleeping Pad - with room to spare for extra layers for both on and off the bike.

I underpacked it for my overnight test, not anticipating the subfreezing temperatures and spring frost blanketing the ground come morning. But that was a user error, as a light down jacket and pants would have fit with room to spare.

I did find that packing out the bag fully multiplied the sway encountered from the harness. And a poorly packed bag, one where the smallest part of the tapered end wasn’t precisely filled, drastically increased sway.

Deuter Cabezon Bags: Conclusion

© Provided by GearJunkie (Photo/Matthew Medendorp)

Lightweight and fairly priced, the Deuter Cabezon collection allows for serious performance on gravel rides - especially for riders to go light and fast without spending an extra fortune on exclusively ultralight or aero bags. It's a strong outing from a company with a history of impressive products that stay true to the Deuter DNA.

Its minimalist construction is not ideal for bikepackers who like to constantly take things in and out throughout the ride. But it is well-suited for those who would rather pack well once and get riding.

The Cabezon's tool-free installation and nothing-but-the-essentials design work in its favor. This optimizes space and hauls more gear than they look capable of fitting. There are a few details to iron out, especially around the saddlebag. But there are more successes than failures across the board. I'm looking forward to putting many more miles on mine, Michigan weather be damned.

https://www.kqed.org/arts/13927576/frisco-daze-san-francisco-rap-album,‘Frisco Daze’ Puts on a New Generation of San Francisco Rap,"Frisco Daze is just the latest development in this cresting wave of creative momentum. City kids are tired of their voices being drowned out, and they have something to say.

“It’s my big mission to highlight the art and culture scene in San Francisco because we were very deprived of that, like before COVID and during COVID,” says DJSay. “And that was the push to be collaborative because — knowing what you’re up against, especially in San Francisco, given the price of rent.”

Produced entirely by Adeyemi, Frisco Daze is pure windows-down party music with a signature, Bay Area slap. DJSay, Mix and DeLaCity conceived its 14 tracks as a journey through a perfect San Francisco day. “Rollin’ Up at Bernal,” which samples Otis Redding’s “Sittin’ On (The Dock of the Bay),” shows Professa Gabel, DinaRo, Serg2x, Ozer, Monk HTS and Made.by.Harry trading bars at a smoke spot with a view. “High Speeds N Heem” by OBN Emony and Allmothug is a perfect soundtrack for the corner store run before the house party. “Azul (DemSco)” pays homage to Dominican dembow and San Francisco’s Latin party scene, with verses from JaaayStayTru, Lirico en la Casa and Frisco Baby, whose double-time, bilingual bars sound like they could catch fire.

Frisco Daze’s three executive producers are all in their late 20s and early 30s, and the featured artists range from 18–44 years old. And with samples from San Francisco 1970s Latin soul legends Malo, and the city’s ’90s underground icons like Cold World Hustlers and Paris, “the Black Panther of hip-hop,” the project has an intergenerational appeal.

Frisco Daze might not be conscious rap in terms of lyrical content, but it embodies an activist mission. The album’s three executive producers and many of its artists devote themselves to community work. By day, DeLaCity is a services coordinator at Roadmap to Peace, a Mission-based Latinx violence prevention initiative. DJSay volunteers with Us4Us, an organization with similar goals in Bayview/Hunters Point. And Mix — proudly the first member of his family to go to college — mentors youth at two educational initiatives, the SMART Program and Dev/Mission.

In other words, DeLaCity, DJSay and Mix don’t just make music about their love for their city — they live it. One of their goals is to inspire San Francisco unity across neighborhoods and cultures. After all, that hasn’t always been the case in the Sucka Free City. In the late ’80s, a neighborhood beef between Sunnydale and the Fillmore resulted in violence. A peaceful period followed when Frisco rap rose to national prominence in the early ’90s, following the success of RBL Posse, I.M.P., Messy Marv and JT the Bigga Figga. But too often, tragedy and incarceration derailed the careers of San Francisco’s biggest stars, and Oakland and Vallejo emerged as more prominent powerhouses of Bay Area rap.

“San Francisco’s biggest problem was that we were always competing against each other, competing for the same space,” says Mix. “And, basically, we were our own worst enemy. And I think what we’re seeing today — and not just with us, but different collectives, different artists, different organizations — we are seeing the result of the mindset changing in the City, and different neighborhoods having peace.”

With the guidance of mentors like beloved Us4Us founder and activist Uncle Damien, who blesses Frisco Daze on the intro, the next generation is growing up with a different message. “When we were in high school, we had the gang injunction stuff going on in the City, and the harsh sentencing that was happening with the D.A. [Kamala Harris] at the time — all of these things impacted a generation,” says Mix. “And now that people are coming out of jail, and people have suffered through so much, they don’t want to repeat that cycle. And it’s being expressed through the music.”

That grassroots push for Frisco unity is picking up momentum just in time for 415 Day on April 15. The Frisco Daze crew is getting ready to celebrate the album with 415 Daze Fest, with live performances and vendors at Monarch Gardens, and 415 Nights at ArenaSF, the official release party with a headlining performance from Young Bari.

And, already, the project is resonating. “Me and Antonio go out on random nights and just have a big ol’ speaker playing the music to see the feedback. People bobbing their heads, asking, ‘What song is that?’ is such a great feeling,” says DJSay.

“Some O.G. that rides a chopper came up,” DeLaCity says, “this gangster-ass dude, was like, ‘What’s that song right there?”

415 Daze Fest takes place on April 15, 1-7 p.m., at Monarch Gardens, with food, vendors and performances by Stunnaman02, Allmothug, OBN Emony, Frisco Baby, In tha Moment and more.

Family Not a Group presents It’s a 415 Day Function at El Rio on April 15, 3-8 p.m. with performances by Stunnaman02, Alien Mac Kitty, Grand-O, Sutro, Afterthought and Professa Gabel.",[],

Unfortunately, those two objectives are often diametrically opposed. But there are ways to keep the environment in mind and still see more of your world. Aurora Expeditions, a climate-neutral travel company, is expanding its offerings to warm-weather destinations in 2023.

Sailings include trips to Costa Rica, the Panama Canal, Cape Verde, the Canary Islands, and the Azores. Aurora Expeditions offers an alternative to large-vessel cruises. The ships each hold a little more than 100 passengers, and each is named after famous conservationists. Here are details on these trips, which depart in April of this year.

The Costa Rica and the Panama Canal trip runs from April 20 to May 30. The ship will depart from Costa Rica, stopping in Cartagena, Colombia, with stops in Manuel Antonio National Park and opportunities to see sloths, spiders, and other rare wildlife. Fares started at $11,130.75 for this sailing, which has already sold out for 2023.

The Cape Verde, Canary Islands & Azores trip is between April 16 and 30. The journey will take travelers through volcanic islands, where they can whale watch, hike, bird watch, and visit multiple UNESCO World heritage sites. This sailing departs and ends in Lisbon, Portugal. This trip is already sold out for 2023, but prices for the journey began at just over $9,000.

Other cruising itineraries offered by the company include trips to Iceland, Antartica, the UK, Ireland, Patagonia, Greenland, Norway, and the Arctic. You can choose between taking an expedition or a discovery tour, and on nearly all journeys there will be chances to participate in citizen science.

Traditional large cruise ships release high volumes of harmful pollutants into the ocean, which can cause oxygen depletion, the spread of bacteria and viruses and an increase of nutrient levels within the ecosystem, according to the Ocean Conservancy. Many large cruise companies have announced efforts to reduce their negative impacts on the environment, but it will be a long and slow road for meaningful change.

Aurora Expeditions has already implemented expedition ships with smaller environmental impact in terms of design and efficiency. The company has already reached 100% climate neutrality, which means that their net impact on the environment is not actively harmful. In coming years, the company is aiming to further reduce its impact and phase in more initiatives that will reduce its carbon footprint.

The new discovery voyages Aurora Expeditions is offering will allow you to engage with some of the world's most stunning wildlife without actively causing it harm. While these definitely aren't budget trips, if you're looking for a more unique experience that you haven't already seen 500 times on your Instagram feed, this might be the type of trip to consider this year.

REI Co-op Gen E Electric Bikes: 20% for REI Co-Op Members

© Provided by GearJunkie

During REI’s annual Spring Bike sale, Co-op members save up to $400 on Co-op Cycles Gen E Electric Bikes. Two Gen E models are available: e1.1 and e1.2. Both options come with a practical step-thru X-shaped aluminum frame, and both offer pedal assist modes that can reach an efficient 20 mph.

Of the two models, the e1.2 is slightly more capable in a variety of ways. First, the 1.2 has 672 Wh of battery capacity versus 417 Wh in the e1.1. That translates to roughly 10 extra miles of range per charge, and a slightly longer charge time. The 1.2 also comes with front suspension in case you plan to occasionally ride off the pavement or on rough roads. And the 1.2 comes with a front cargo rack, while the 1.1 does not.

Still, both models are well-equipped for hauling gym bags, yoga mats, shopping bags, and baskets.

Whichever model you choose, these REI Co-op e-bikes are all about utility. They’re sturdy, simple, and affordably priced.

https://www.theinertia.com/gear/patagonia-descensionist-40l-backcountry-ski-backpack-review/,Patagonia Descensionist 40L Backpack Review,"Support our work! The Inertia may earn a small commission from affiliate links in this article. Learn more about our gear review policy here.

A good backcountry touring backpack should accomplish a few key things: Keep your gear safe from the elements, be easy to access when needed, and also allow for a manageable load that won’t be exhausting to carry up a mountain. It’s clear from the design of their Descensionist 40L backpack that Patagonia knows these things, too. In testing, I found the pack to execute very well on what I’d consider the key points for a backcountry backpack, without any added fluff that might weigh you down or get in the way when things get hectic.

By now, very few people are strangers to Patagonia and their efforts to improve our planet through smart consumerism. By building products that can withstand years of abuse while sourced from materials that don’t pollute, it’s hard not to root for this company’s success. But no good intentions can outweigh our practical needs to get products that do what they are supposed to do – especially in the backcountry when you are carrying life saving equipment. So in order to get in the good books here, the pack needs to do what it’s supposed to do – carry gear efficiently and be accessible within seconds of needing it.

Let’s take a deeper look:

Pros Cons Easily expandable main compartment with roll-top No top storage space due to roll-top design Cinch strap on top to pack things down Lack of external loops for clipping on extras Large side access panel No access from back – only top or side Ultra comfortable No dedicated hydration reservoir space Lightweight

Who is the Descensionist 40L Best Suited For?

The Patagonia Descensionist is a trusty, lightweight backcountry touring pack that is a reliable asset on overnight or multi-day touring missions. Even for day trips where a bit of extra cargo space is needed for items such as a rope or extra layers, this backpack does the job. The roll-top on the main compartment can extend when you need more space, or roll down into a tighter unit for days where you don’t need to carry as much.

Notable Features

The greatest asset of this bag is the simplicity of its design. It has everything you would want in a larger touring backpack, but none of the added frills that might weigh you down. As such, it’s a great choice for those looking to assemble a lightweight rig without compromising on pack space or comfort.

With a padded back and body straps, I could carry a 20-pound load without even noticing. The pack had good weight distribution, and for those who know how to properly load a pack, it’ll feel great for hours, whether going up or ripping down.

Loading the pack with gear was easy through the roll-top enclosure and a burly cinch strap helped pack it all in and ensure that, should you take a tumble, your gear won’t turn into an unnecessary yard-sale.

All the safety gear easily fits into the front compartment without feeling too tight or too loose. Goldilocks would be proud. This is important when faced with a rescue situation where every second counts and you don’t want to be caught fumbling for gear.

Drawbacks

It’s hard to be critical of this pack as it does what it claims to do: be a simple, lightweight and effective backcountry touring pack. That said, there is no access from the back of the pack, so if you need something at the bottom of the pack you’ll need to use the side zipper, which could be problematic in deep snow or times where you need to get to it fast. It also only has access for one side, so you’ll need to pack mindfully and keep the stuff you’ll need more often within reach of the side zip.

In Summary

This pack was made with simplicity and efficiency in mind, and that’s where it shines. The Descensionist 40L is a comfortable, lightweight pack for backcountry touring that can also fit enough gear for an overnight mission.

In addition to a well-made pack, you have the brand reputation of Patagonia and their commitment to sustainability and the environment; not the least of which is keeping your gear kicking as long as possible – if your pack does end up getting damaged, you can send it in for repair, helping to extend the life of the pack well beyond the first frayed strap or busted zipper.

If you’re interested in reliability, simplicity, and lightweight comfort, this is the pack for you.

https://gripped.com/video/sean-villanueva-odriscoll-and-pete-whittaker-climbing-in-patagonia/,Sean Villanueva O’Driscoll and Pete Whittaker Climbing in Patagonia,"This past winter, Pete Whittaker and Sean Villanueva O’Driscoll teamed up for a few routes in Patagonia. They managed to make the first free ascent of two routes.

First they made the first free ascent of Yacaré on Rafael Juarez in the Fitz Roy Range, which was just opened by Pedro Odell and Tomás Odell. The 550-metre went free at 5.12 up some wide cracks. “Higher on the route there was an offwidth splitter pitch which hadn’t been fully freed. With Sean loving a good offwidth struggle as well,” said Whittaker. “We got drawn into the idea of giving it ago. Turned out to be quite tricky due to a lot of ice and verglass in the wide section. The pitch turned out to be 60 metres of incredible rock and incredible grovel, with a delicate slab move to connect the cracks.”

Taking advantage of another weather window, Whittaker and Villanueva O’Driscoll made the first free ascent of Anda p’ alla! on the west face of Guillaumet. It was first climbed in July by a team of four. Whittaker said, “The route didn’t disappoint, brilliant rock on perfect flaring splitters… I got stopped by an obvious crux; A thin seam with awkward body positioning and flaring finger jams. They graded Anda p’ alla! 5.13b and managed to climb it in a day and return home.

Villanueva O’Driscoll and Whittaker are two of the best crack climbers going, but Villanueva O’Driscoll has over a decade of experience in Patagonia whereas this was Whittaker’s first trip. Watch this highly entertaining film about their climbs.

https://snowbrains.com/patagonia-gets-involved-in-the-lcc-gondola-debate/,"Patagonia Gets Involved in the Little Cottonwood Canyon, UT, Gondola Debate","Patagonia is an American outdoor clothing retailer well-known for promoting activism concerning environmental issues. The company established “Patagonia Action Works,” which assists individuals to connect with environmental groups enabling them to participate in efforts that directly promote action against environmental issues. Patagonia commits 1% of its total sales to environmental groups, estimated at $209.1m in FY22.

The outdoor clothing retailer recently joined forces with opponents of a proposed gondola connecting Salt Lake Valley with Alta and Snowbird ski resorts. The gondola was one of many proposed solutions to the immense traffic problems on Utah’s State Route 210 due to the high number of skiers visiting the legendary resorts every winter.







By 2021, two solutions remained: an enhanced bus system and an eight-mile-long gondola, which, if completed, would be one of the longest in the world. In August of 2022, the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) chose the gondola option to mitigate the traffic problems, and that is where the debate is today.

Since UDOT chose the gondola option, there has been increased scrutiny and debate rallying environmental organizations and companies like Patagonia, which oppose the construction of the gondola. Both sides of the argument have presented facts supporting their case on why the gondola is either positive or negative for the community and the environment.

The taxpayers of Utah will pay the overall price tag ($500m) and the estimated $7m per year to run and operate the gondola. This has brought much criticism from those who do not support the gondola project stating that there are other more cost-effective and environmentally friendly options. Critics also argue the price of $500m could be utilized in different areas that could help Utah’s residents, like providing meals for the homeless, raising the cost of teachers’ salaries, providing scholarships to students, and assisting local farmers during times of drought.

One criticism of the gondola is that it only provides access to two resorts (Alta and Snowbird) and leaves out other parts of the canyon with points of interest that guests could visit. Solitude Mountain Resort and Brighton Resort are not much farther away in Big Cottonwood Canyon. All four ski resorts face the same problem of only having one access road and the same road for guests to travel out of.







Patagonia has publicly disapproved of the plans for the gondola project and has rallied its grass-root organizations to oppose the construction of the gondola. Patagonia’s website has an “Activism” tab on its home page, which provides information on how individuals can get involved and confront environmental issues.

On Patagonia’s website, they have posted the following:

SAVE LITTLE COTTONWOOD CANYON

This past summer, the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) announced its preferred solution to reducing traffic congestion in Utah’s Little Cottonwood Canyon: the world’s longest, most expensive gondola. Spanning eight miles and costing Utah taxpayers an estimated $1.4 billion, it would only stop at two private ski areas (leaving others to still deal with traffic congestion) and jeopardize climbing areas, trails, and a watershed that supplies nearly 60% of Salt Lake Valley’s drinking water. Bottom line: Instead of solving traffic congestion, the gondola could potentially make it worse for all but the select resort users who can afford a ticket while forever marring a pristine and prized landscape. You can help the fight. We have until April 18th to tell UDOT a gondola has no place in our canyon and should not be exempt from the Roadless Rule. Send this message to UDOT, or use it as inspiration to craft your own.

Patagonia has also prepared a pre-written email on their website for opposers of the gondola who can send an email to UDOT. The only information required by a person is to fill out their: name, zip code, phone number, and email address.

The pre-written email to UDOT on Patagonia’s website reads:

“I oppose the Little Cottonwood Canyon Gondola project and urge you to consider lower cost and more effective alternatives to reducing traffic congestion in the canyon. The gondola will not improve traffic congestion. Instead, it will permanently alter Twin Peaks, Lone Peak, and White Pine Roadless Areas, threaten our critical watershed, destroy popular rock climbing areas, and disrupt running, backcountry skiing, and hiking in the area.

I cannot support a proposal that would reduce acres of land that are classified as “Roadless,” let alone support taxation for a project that would fail to improve canyon access for non-resort users while benefiting a slim few. Claiming that the gondola is exempt from the “Roadless Rule” because it’s not technically a road is a willful misinterpretation of the spirit of the rule.

I support lower-cost solutions that utilize our existing infrastructure, such as carpool incentives (ex. occupancy-based tolling), year-round enhanced bus service with stops at multiple locations and more frequent service at peak times, enforcement of the traction law, and mandatory parking reservations at ski resorts.”

Utah’s Department of Transportation (UDOT), Mitchell Shaw, said that reducing the number of vehicles by the primary users (skiers and recreational visitors) should reduce traffic congestion and improve mobility on S.R. 210. UDOT has been criticized by those who oppose the construction of the gondola, and UDOT’s Mitchell Shaw states, “UDOT is not responsible for increasing use at the trailheads or dispersed recreation sites, but for improving mobility on S.R. 210.” UDOT added that it doesn’t see its role as facilitating canyon transportation outside of cars, which can be driven to and parked at trailhead areas.

On the other side of the debate are the proponents of the gondola project, who also argue why it would benefit the region. Utah’s Department of Transportation has stated that the gondola would be exempt from the “Roadless Rule” because it is not a road, and any timber removal would be incidental. UDOT also states the USDA Forest Administration as the agency that is responsible for handling policies and regulations regarding trailheads and recreational sites. UDOT added, “If the USDA Forest Service identifies a need to increase transit service at the trailheads, it can work with UTA to implement it.”







UDOT began with initially having 124 possible solutions to the traffic issues, hearing all the proposals, and going through the necessary steps to formulate the best course of action. Supporters believe the proposed gondola is the best solution to the traffic nightmares plaguing State Route 210 every winter with skiers heading up to the mountains. Alta and Snowbird Ski Resorts offer free bus shuttle service to their guests from their resorts to help mitigate traffic congestion.

Proponents of the gondola project believe that the answer to the traffic problem is mass transit and the time to mitigate it now. They point to the past when 30 years ago, a similar mass transit solution was presented and voted against. It was a light-rail system that would help stem the traffic congestion in the same manner as the gondola project is designed to do as well. The area’s population has grown dramatically over the past 30 years, and proponents of the gondola project urge voters and lawmakers to plan for the area’s future now.

The Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) extended the public’s comment period, ending on Tuesday, April 18th. The Wasatch Front Regional Council, which comprises county, city, and transportation planners throughout the state, has the final vote after that, which will be in May.",['Gregg Frantz'],2023-04-17 10:06:33+00:00
https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/18/patagonia-ceo-ryan-gellerts-best-career-advice-ask-these-2-questions.html,2 questions that helped Patagonia's CEO go from packing boxes for $6 an hour to leading a $3 billion brand,"Patagonia CEO Ryan Gellert is seen on stage during the ""Earth Is Now Our Only Shareholder"" keynote session during 2023 SXSW Conference and Festival on March 12, 2023 in Austin, Texas.

Patagonia CEO Ryan Gellert is the first to admit that he's ""the last person anybody should ask career advice,"" he said in conversation with Katie Couric at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas, recently. He describes himself growing up as a skateboarder in Cocoa Beach, Fla., surrounded by people focused on their passions: surfing professionally, opening surf businesses, or bartending to cover bills and spending their free time surfing. Gellert didn't share the interest but made it his mission to find his passion and make it his life's work. Over time, Gellert managed to go from being unsure about his future, to packing boxes in a warehouse, to becoming CEO of a $3 billion brand and one of the most prominent businesses fighting climate change.

His best career advice: Ask yourself these 2 questions

Gellert says he wasn't sure what kind of career he wanted for himself but studied finance in college and later earned a business degree at the Florida Institute of Technology. He moved to Salt Lake City and got into skiing, then one day dropped off his resume with Black Diamond, a climbing equipment company based there. When he got a phone call a week later, Gellert was ""convinced"" that as an MBA holder, they'd line him up with a corporate job. ""And they said, 'No, we'd love to offer you $6 an hour to come pack boxes in the warehouse.' And I thought about it long and hard. And in the end I said, 'Yeah, I'll do it.'"" As Gellert sees it, ""the only consistent thing in my career is, I've always asked myself about the next opportunity in front of me: Does this look interesting? Is this tied to what I'm really passionate about?"" He was passionate about the outdoors, particularly rock climbing, and figured that by staying with Black Diamond, he could learn on the job and work his way up the corporate chain. Gellert ended up staying with the company, built its presence in Asia, took it public and was the brand president before he left for Patagonia in 2014.

What he learned from Patagonia's founder

Gellert became Patagonia's CEO in 2020 in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic and racial justice protests erupting around the country. He recalls his first in-person meetings with Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard a few months into his new role. Gellert describes Chouinard as both principled and entrepreneurial, ""which, to be clear, can drive you absolutely mad when you're trying to run a big global, complex organization, but it's so inspiring."" ""If he gets an idea,"" Gellert explains, ""the first thing he does is take a step in that direction. He doesn't necessarily plan the next 10 years. He just takes a step in that direction."" Step by step, Gellert says, Chouinard will ask himself: ""What did I learn? Do I still feel like I'm on the right path? And if he does, he keeps moving and takes another step. If not, he changes course.""

We have created the world's problems, and they're not solvable without businesses taking responsibility. Ryan Gellert CEO, Patagonia

Gellert recalls one informal discussion on Chouinard's back porch that would set the tone for his new job: ""One of the things he said is, 'Hey, we've got to figure out the future ownership of this company.' And I thought, 'That's a great time to do that in the middle of a pandemic when we've got 27 other things flying around,'"" Gellert says. Gellert jokes that he hoped Chouinard might lose focus on transitioning the ownership of the company in the midst of the pandemic. But Chouinard kept raising the issue of finding another owner and committing more of Patagonia's to conservation efforts. Two years later, in September 2022, Chouinard announced a plan to donate the entire company, worth $3 billion, as well as its roughly $100 million annual earnings to fight climate change.

'We've lost the right to be pessimistic'",['Jennifer Liu'],2023-03-18 00:00:00
https://variety.com/2023/film/news/patagonia-yvon-chouinard-wild-life-documentary-donating-his-company-1235580745/,Patagonia Founder Yvon Chouinard on Wild Life and Donating His Company,"At Tuesday’s New York City premiere of Nat Geo’s documentary “Wild Life,” Yvon Chouinard, founder of Patagonia, shed light on his 2022 decision to donate the entire apparel brand, worth $3 billion, to a trust dedicated to fighting the climate crisis.



“I’m kind of pessimistic about the fate of this planet,” Chouinard said. “We’ve been giving one percent of our sales for a long time. We’ve given away $200 or $300 million over the years, but I’m always thinking, ‘What more can I do?”



Directed by Oscar winners Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, “Wild Life” chronicles the decades-long efforts by conservationist Kris Tompkins and her late husband and the North Face founder, Doug Tompkins, to create national parks throughout Chile and Argentina. The couple helped Chouinard, who appears in the doc, create and run Patagonia.



Chouinard, who joined Vasarhelyi, Chin and Tompkins onstage after the MoMA screening, added that his decision to give the planet $3 billion also had to do with his two children, who have “simple lives” and no desire to inherit Patagonia.



“When we found a way to basically make earth our stockholder, it seemed real logical,” he continued. “It’s a way for Patagonia as a company to give a lot more money. We’ve given away $33 million since November. We’re going to give away another $40 or $50 [million] within the next couple months. It’s a pretty good system. I can tell you this: it’s not a burden. It’s really a lot of fun.”

As with their previous films “Free Solo” and “Meru,” Chin and Vasarhelyi’s “Wild Life” explores the world of elite climbers – in which Chin is a leading figure – mixing adventure footage that was shot in Chile’s Patagonia National Park, a former private reserve that Tompkins Conservation donated in 2018, with interviews and archival footage.



Chin, who climbed with both Doug Tompkins and Chouinard, was keen on making “Wild Life.” Tompkins on the other hand was wary.



“Jimmy just started showing up,” she explained. “I’d say what are you doing? And he would say, ‘I’m just going to film this stuff and we will see if something happens to it.’ Finally, it began to take shape and they asked me if I would be interested in something like this. I was reticent at first but then I thought if there was ever going to be a film about our story it would be with Jimmy and Chai. So I just put my life in their hands.



Vasarhelyi was also initially hesitant about the project, which will have a limited theatrical release beginning April 14 and stream on Disney+ May 25.



“He was like, we really should make a film about my mentors, the icons of the outdoor industry,” she recalled of her husband’s passion for the project. “But I don’t climb. I don’t ski. I don’t really go outside. So I was like, no way. Oh, no,” Vasarhelyi said.



Eventually the filmmaker came around and found herself captivated by Kris Tompkins’ life story and how she handled life after the death of her husband.



“It just became so compelling, this idea of Kris finding (her way),” Vasarhelyi said. “We made this film for our kids. Climate change is the existential question of our children’s generation. And this is a story that says very clearly, put one foot in front of the other and just try because trying matters.”",['Addie Morfoot'],2023-04-12 19:25:30+00:00
https://fortune.com/2022/09/14/patagonia-chair-we-are-turning-capitalism-on-its-head-by-making-the-earth-our-only-shareholder-charles-conn/,Patagonia Chair: ‘We are turning capitalism on its head by making the Earth our only shareholder’,"For 50 years there has been an impassioned debate about the appropriate aims and responsibilities of companies. Some side with Milton Friedman’s influential viewpoint, asserting that the only responsibility of business is to generate profits for shareholders. Others believe companies have broader responsibilities to society and the environment. Lately, even state legislatures have weighed in, proposing to ban financial managers who take ESG criteria into account. But while the battle of words continues, investors, customers, employees, and the public have moved forward. The question now is not whether but how far the pendulum has shifted towards responsibility and purpose. Surveys show that most investors believe ESG goals should trump short-term profit, and more than ever, employees and consumers are choosing companies based on what they stand for.

Great companies are loved and respected for their values and commitments to their communities in addition to what they make, not for the creation of shareholder wealth. This year Patagonia was named in the top group of most reputable companies based on criteria such as product quality, trust, citizenship, and ethics. So was Chick-fil-A. You couldn’t find two companies with more divergent values, but both have a clear purpose that extends beyond generating profits. They stand for something that people understand. Our most loved companies are already purpose-led organizations.

As a tech entrepreneur, public company CEO, and investor, I have benefited from shareholder capitalism. It’s a system that has brought us reductions in absolute poverty, longer lives through medical innovation, and many other improvements, as well as great shareholder returns. But let’s be honest: it made its gains at an enormous cost, including increasing inequality and widescale uncompensated environmental damage. We have subsidized buoyant shareholder returns by fraying the fabric of our societies and using up the planet we live on. We all know this is happening—the world is literally on fire.

Even Big Business knows the narrow extractive model of shareholder capitalism does not serve us. Leading institutions like The Business Roundtable and the World Economic Forum have worked to re-brand shareholder capitalism as stakeholder capitalism, adding responsibilities to workers, the environment, and society. Their investors demand this shift. But while this new moniker sounds good, to date actions haven’t caught up to words. The flowery language of annual reports is simply incompatible with standard forms of incorporation that require companies to only maximize shareholder returns.

Recently, a more concrete movement around company responsibility has gained momentum, the Benefit Corporation, which is a form of incorporation that puts people, environmental, and governance aims alongside profit inside company legal charters and requires specific goals and improvement over time. Similar efforts by accounting bodies and think tanks seek to develop general accounting standards for measuring companies’ social and environmental impacts that could be required for future company reporting. These two innovations are much more substantial progress toward making companies responsible players in building sustainable, prosperous societies.

At Patagonia, we signed up as a Benefit Company early on–and it has helped us clarify our responsibilities. For us, this means constantly measuring and managing our environmental footprint, seeking to reduce our use of water, carbon, and dangerous chemicals in our clothing. We invest in regenerative organic agriculture and in the circular economy by using recycled fabrics and repairing and re-selling used clothing. We price our products to reflect their real costs. We unapologetically support climate and environmental activism. And we transparently report our progress to our communities. We have used purpose capitalism to create a successful company that is committed to minimizing environmental impact and being a positive force in society.

A few years ago, we changed our mission to something both simple and hard: We’re in business to save our home planet. This clear definition of purpose is beyond any stretch goal. It has forced us to go much deeper into what it will take to have zero negative environmental impact while still making great products for our outdoor athlete customers.

Now in our 50th year, we’re going further still. Our founder Yvon Chouinard and his family have given all their Patagonia equity to a charitable entity to fund environmental conservation. We are directing all the value created by the company to specific conservation projects and advocacy. Instead of exploiting natural resources to make shareholder returns, we are turning shareholder capitalism on its head by making the Earth our only shareholder.

As a closely held company, this huge change was easier for us than others. But the point is for companies to make transparent purpose commitments that make sense to their business, and to be held to account by their communities.

Companies have responsibilities to their workers, customers, the environment, and yes, their investors. Shareholder capitalism advocates think goals other than profit will confuse investors. Nonsense. Investors already look to many company attributes when allocating capital. Over time, the market will continue to work and responsible purpose-led companies will attract more investment, better employees, and deeper customer loyalty. This is not “woke” capitalism. It’s the future of business if we want to build a better world for our children and all other creatures.

Doug was the best friend and climbing buddy of her boss, Yvon Chouinard, and he was known as a brilliant, arrogant bon vivant. In 1964, Doug had cofounded the North Face with his first wife, Susie Tompkins Buell. Seven years later, the two started another clothing company, Esprit. After cashing out, he moved to Chile to live alone in a small cabin.

Kristine, a free-spirited California girl who had worked her way up the ladder at Patagonia after an entry-level, two-dollar-an-hour “assistant packing” job in her teens, knew Doug’s reputation. So when he tried to convince her to stay in South America with him, she demurred. (She also happened to be engaged to another man at the time.) But he was persistent. Months later, a five-day visit to Chile to see the farm Doug had purchased at the edge of a fjord turned into five weeks. Finally, Kristine returned to the States, “blew up her personal life,” and never looked back—by 1993 she had quit her job, married Doug, and moved into his cabin.

For the next two decades, the pair lived between remote homes in Chile and Argentina, only occasionally returning to California. They had a grand plan: buy and protect as much land threatened by logging and overgrazing as possible. Eventually, through a series of nonprofits run by the Tompkinses, the couple purchased hundreds of thousands of acres from ranchers and absentee landowners. Their fairy-tale life ended in tragedy in 2015, when Doug died in a kayaking accident in Chile at 72. Wracked with grief, Kristine was left alone at the helm of Tompkins Conservation, which was on the cusp of making the largest private land donation in history, to take the form of numerous national parks granted to the governments of Chile and Argentina.

Who better to capture this epic saga of love and loss on film than the Oscar-winning couple of Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin? Their new documentary, Wild Life, follows Kristine Tompkins’s trajectory from barefoot Southern California girl to CEO of one of the most influential outdoor brands in the country to champion of conservation. The film will debut in select theaters starting April 14 and will be available to stream on May 26 on Disney+.

Chin met the Tompkinses through Chouinard and Rick Ridgeway, a climber and former Patagonia vice president. “Doug, Yvon, and Rick have all been heroes to me since I started out as a young dirtbag climber and photographer living in Yosemite,” Chin said in an email. And after spending time with Kristine, he “quickly learned that she is a force of nature, an incredible human being. So of course, taking on this film was something deeply personal to me.”

Before Doug died, Chin had visited the couple in South America and shot footage of them, noodling on the notion of making a film. After the kayaking accident, he and Vasarhelyi approached Kristine about putting together a movie of her life. “It took me a while to think that a film like this should be made,” said Kristine, adding that she only gave her approval because she thought it would be good for encouraging conservation efforts. “I decided if I was going to do it, I would do it only with Jimmy and Chai. They are extraordinary filmmakers and trusted friends.”

Wild Life delves into the Tompkinses’ years of joy and struggle and the aftermath of the tragedy, as told through intimate interviews with Kristine and a close circle of lifelong companions. Chin’s signature stunning photography of Chile and Argentina is intercut with 1960s footage of America’s original climbing, skiing, and surfing dirtbag royalty: Kristine singing the Beach Boys’ “California Girls”; the Grateful Dead playing at the opening of the first North Face store; Chouinard, Doug, and their funhog crew unfurling a flag after their historic ascent of Fitz Roy. The clips add levity and also bring into focus that, even before they were a couple, the Tompkinses were fundamental players in the creation myth of modern American outdoor culture.

It’s clear that Doug and Kristine were soulmates. Yet they were also intense overachievers committed to conservation work in countries that were often suspicious of and hostile toward their efforts—some Chileans, for example, thought that the couple’s real aim was to populate their land with American bison. The pair rarely had time to explore together. In the film, Kristine sets out to climb a 7,500-foot peak in Patagonia’s Chacabuco Valley that her husband and Chouinard first summited in 2009. Doug dubbed the peak Cerro Kristine. Chouinard and Ridgeway—both were on the kayaking expedition that killed Doug—accompany Kristine on her journey to reach the summit, along with Chin and professional rock climber Timmy O’Neill. “Why did we never climb our mountain together?” Kristine asks the clouds as she stands alone, looking out over Patagonia National Park.

The documentary is a testament to fierce love and how its power can serve a greater purpose. “There was a deep, deep union and devotion to each other, and they came together with a common vision,” says friend and filmmaker Edgar Boyle in Wild Life. But the grief that resulted when that union was severed by tragedy is difficult to watch. At one point, Kristine recounts, while flying with Doug’s remains to his final resting place near their home in the Chacabuco Valley, she carved their names in the coffin with a small knife. “Doug’s death was an amputation,” Kristine told me. “I took some long walks by myself and was never sure I’d turn around and walk back.”

The only way forward was to dive even further into her conservation work. With the help of a roughly 300-person staff at Tompkins Conservation, she exceeded her late husband’s dream of creating 12 national parks. The current count: 15, along with two marine parks and a total of 14.8 million protected acres in Chile and Argentina—an area roughly the size of West Virginia. Those numbers keep expanding, along with Kristine’s seemingly endless supply of energy to continue the work she started with her husband. “I carry Doug around in my pocket. If I get really stuck on something, I simply ask: ‘What would you do?’ I am just grateful that we have this marriage,” she said, still speaking of their union in the present tense. “It’s given me unbelievable strength.”

Kristine is still the president of Tompkins Conservation, but she has relinquished day-to-day operations to focus primarily on strategy. In late February, she met with Chilean president Gabriel Boric to move forward with a proposed donation of 230,000 acres on behalf of Tompkins Conservation, with a view toward creating national park number 16 at Cape Froward, on the Brunswick Peninsula, the southernmost point of the continent. The rugged, largely unexplored region is a refuge for endangered species like the huemul deer. The proposal reclassifies state land that, if included, would make the area bigger than Grand Teton National Park. In recent years, two independent local organizations have spun off from Tompkins Conservation. Rewilding Chile and Rewilding Argentina each work in their respective countries to bring back endangered species—from the Andean condor in Patagonia National Park to the jaguar in Argentina’s Iberá National Park.

“I want people to realize that this film is not about Doug and Kristine,” she told me. “It’s the representation of hundreds of Chileans’ and Argentines’ work. Mother Nature is not winning this game. We are all on the losing team, and everybody needs to join the fight.”",[],2023-04-12 11:00:35+00:00
https://sgbonline.com/exec-lululemon-patagonia-lead-activewear-brands-in-resale-popularity/,"EXEC: Lululemon, Patagonia Lead Activewear Brands In Resale Popularity","Lululemon is the second most popular brand in resale, according to ThredUp’s 11th Annual Resale Report. Other activewear brands that made its Top 20 Most Popular Brands In Resale include Patagonia, at No. 6; Vuori, in 10th place; and The North Face, at 18.

Overall, the most popular brand at resale, according to the ThredUp Report, was Torrid, followed in the Top 10 by Lululemon, Madewell, Zara, Free People, Patagonia, Reformation, Urban Outfitters, Overland, and Vuori. Levi’s landed at No. 11 in its Top 20 list, followed by Anthropologie, Abercrombie & Fitch, Modcloth, Lane Bryant, Johnny Was, The North Face, Lillie Pulitzer, and Tory Birch.

ThredUp reported that 30 percent of the Top 20 brands in its report offer dedicated resale programs, including Lululemon Like New, Patagonia’s Worn Wear and The North Face Renewed. Hot items include:

Dr. Martens boots,

Fjallraven Backpack,

Patagonia vests,

SmartWool track jacket,

Vuori casual pants,

Lululemon Belt Bag, and

The North Face raincoat.

Resale Expected To Nearly Triple By 2027

ThredUp’s study, based on research conducted by GlobalData, delivered bullish growth for resale, with the global secondhand market forecasted to nearly double by 2027, reaching $351 billion. Global resale sales are predicted to expand three times faster than new clothing sales.

In 2022, global second-hand sales reached $177 billion, up 28 percent.

In the U.S., the secondhand market is expected to reach $70 billion by 2027, up from $39 billion in 2022. Secondhand sales grew 11 percent in 2022, but growth is expected to accelerate to 26 percent in 2023 and continue its momentum into 2024, growing at 33 percent. Overall, resale in the U.S. is expected to grow nine times faster than the broader retail clothing sector by 2027.

U.S. consumers bought 1.4 million secondhand apparel items in 2022 that they usually would have purchased new, up 40 percent from 2021.

Among channels, online resale is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the U.S. secondhand market, expected to grow 21 percent annually over the next five years, reaching $38 billion by 2027.

Resale includes traditional thrift and donation, resale platforms from brands or retailers and resale platforms, including ThredUp, The RealReal, Depop, and Poshmark.

ThredUp’s findings were based on its December 2022 survey of 3,012 U.S. adults over 18, asking specific questions about their behaviors and preferences for secondhand, and a survey in January 2023 of the Top 50 U.S. fashion retailers and brands.

Among consumers surveyed by ThredUp, value is the number one driver influencing purchasing decisions in resale. The remaining Top 5 resale drivers for respondents were quality, selection, convenience, and transparency. Respondents considered trends to be the weakest spending motivator.

Among Gen-Z respondents, more than half said they are more likely to shop with a brand that offers secondhand apparel alongside new, and 64 percent said they search for an item secondhand before buying it new.

Among retailers surveyed, more than two in three who offer resale said its integral to their company’s long-term growth strategy. Eighty-two percent of retailers who offer resale said they expect resale to generate a positive return on investment.

“Resale is starting to blossom globally, with many of the largest retailers in the world adopting more circular business models; value continues to be a key driver that motivates consumers to think secondhand first; and at the same time, global climate issues have increased awareness of resale’s potential to reduce fashion’s impact on the environment,” said James Reinhart, ThredUP’s CEO. “It’s clear we’re on a promising trajectory, and by working together through collective action, we can alter fashion’s future for the better.”

Globally, the study showed that 52 percent of consumers shopped for secondhand apparel in 2022. One in three apparel items bought in the last 12 months was secondhand, and two in five articles in Gen Z’s closet are secondhand. Among the consumer respondents, 37 percent spent a higher percentage of their apparel budget on secondhand last year. Of those, 63 percent increased their spending in response to inflation.

Younger Generations Driving Resale Demand

Younger generations are expected to account for nearly two-thirds of incremental secondhand spending as their purchasing power increases, according to ThredUp. Among generations, secondhand sales in the U.S. are expected to expand by 33 percent for Millennials through 2027, 28 percent for Gen-Z, 26 percent for Gen-X, and 12 percent for Baby Boomers.

The study found that 58 percent of Gen-Z and Millennials said their closet contributes to climate change, compared to 43 percent of overall consumers. Sixty-three percent of Gen Z and Millennials said they can reduce their footprint, compared to 55 percent of general consumers. Sixty-one percent of Gen Z and Millennials consider themselves sustainability-focused, compared to 51 percent of general consumers.

Retailers Attracted To Resale’s Sustainability Benefits

Among the retailers surveyed by ThredUp, 45 percent who offer resale said they satisfy investor demands around ESG. More than one-third of retailers said if resale proved successful, they would cut production of new products.

Overall, 86 percent of retail executives said their customers are participating in resale, up 8 percent from 2021.

Eighty-eight brands launched dedicated resale programs in 2022, a 244 percent increase from 2021. Fifty-eight percent of retail executives said offering resale options to customers is becoming table stakes, up six percent from 2021.

https://www.asicentral.com/news/newsletters/promogram/march-2023/patagonia-once-again-allows-direct-branding-on-apparel/,Patagonia Once Again Allows Direct Branding on Apparel,"The move comes two years after the company banned co-branding directly on garments, for sustainability reasons. Patagonia will also be expanding its Worn Wear program to accept pre-owned logoed merch for repair and resale.

Patagonia is bringing direct embroidery back – just not on the front of its garments.

The popular clothing brand, available to promotional products distributors through supplier Driving Impressions (asi/50864), will allow co-branding on locations that include the back yoke and the sleeve of its garments, according to an email Driving Impressions sent to customers last week.

Patagonia products like this jacket (83580) available from Driving Impressions (asi/50864) could now have logos embroidered directly on them, thanks to a policy reversal from the outdoor apparel brand.

It’s a reversal of a decision Patagonia made two years ago. In April 2021, the company stopped allowing direct embroidery on its products, citing sustainability concerns. In a blog post at the time, Patagonia said it believed that co-branding on its garments would shorten their lifespans. For example, when someone changes jobs, they don’t necessarily want to continue wearing a branded fleece from their old gig. The thought was that co-branding limits the reusability of apparel, making it more likely to end up in a landfill, rather than entering the reuse market.

“Patagonia is in the outdoor industry. That’s our main focus,” Shaun Willhite, group sales manager for Patagonia, told ASI Media, adding that group sales have always been more of a side project for the brand. “We’ve found some really great partners in the ASI world. … The thing that happened a few years ago was we weren’t feeling good about all this logoed apparel going into landfills or stashed in people’s closets. We said, we’ve got to pause what we’re doing until we figure out next steps.”

Patagonia’s decision to start allowing limited embroidery on its products coincides with an expected expansion of the company’s Worn Wear program, which allows people to trade in used Patagonia gear for store credit – or buy pre-worn Patagonia clothing at a discount. In the past, Patagonia said it couldn’t accept branded apparel in the program. In the near future, however, the Worn Wear program will begin accepting qualified styles that have other company’s logos, though the store credit offered will be different than standard pricing, since the logos will need to be altered, according to the email from Driving Impressions.

“They have developed new solutions to either remove, repair or repurpose embroidered Patagonia products, to better extend their usable lifespan and to keep them out of the landfill,” Driving Impressions noted.

The Worn Wear department is experimenting with solutions like covering up corporate logos with a “really creative patch,” Willhite of Patagonia told ASI Media. Sometimes, however, removing logos requires a more labor-intensive effort, like taking a whole panel off a jacket and replacing it with a new one. “We’re still organizing Worn Wear to take back in a big way all of these logoed items in closets,” Willhite said. “We’re really excited about that.”

Promo distributors expressed enthusiasm at the prospect of working with Patagonia products again.

“Our clients never stopped asking for the Patagonia brand, and we’re excited to be able to offer this purpose-driven retail brand again,” said Mel Hubner, director of social impact and sustainability at Brand Fuel (asi/145025).

Hubner added that Brand Fuel, a Certified B Corp like Patagonia, was especially glad to learn that the Worn Wear program would be accepting branded merch. “This will raise the bar for other suppliers, and it will create a greater collective impact in preventing our industry’s products from ending up in the landfill,” she added.

Thomas Rector, CEO of Screenbroidery (asi/305623), likes that Patagonia’s mission-driven purpose will have a place in the promo industry. “We can talk about why Patagonia products have longer staying power, are produced responsibly and support those in need,” he said. “I do understand Patagonia wanting to be selective on what corporations are branded on their products. Their compromise is perfect, and I’m excited to be able to again offer Patagonia to our customers.”

Even when direct embroidery was off-limits, there were workarounds for distributors and their clients. Removable branding options, like logoed zipper pulls, woven hem tags or patches, were acceptable for decorating Patagonia garments. Distributors could also sell the apparel blank to their customers.

But the addition of direct embroidery options is a game-changer, said Mitch Silver, vice president of marketing and sales at Printable (asi/299458), who noted that his company frequently got requests from financial services clients for Patagonia apparel.

“Our clients are really going to like this alternative sleeve or back-of-neck location option,” Silver said. “Many of them don’t necessarily want left-chest embroidery anyway.”

Driving Impressions noted in its email to customers that the new directive from Patagonia isn’t a free-for-all: “Orders will continue to be approved and accepted on a per-order basis,” the supplier wrote. Driving Impressions encouraged distributors to send them the end-user and its website for preapproval before pitching the Patagonia brand to customers, to avoid issues.

How to handle unwanted and unused logoed apparel and promotional products has been a hot topic as the promo industry focuses on sustainability and creating a more circular economic model. Many charities that accept clothing donations, for example, say they cannot take anything that has a corporate logo on it. But several suppliers – including Everywhere Apparel (asi/53059) and Marine Layer (asi/68730) – accept preowned logoed T-shirts for recycling. And industry programs like SwagCycle will help end-users donate or recycle unwanted or unusable merch.

Patagonia has had a somewhat fraught relationship with branded merch. A few years before its 2021 decision on direct embroidery, the company shifted its corporate sales strategy “to increase the number of Certified B Corporations, 1% for the Planet members and other mission-driven companies that prioritize the planet” that it works with.",['Asi Central'],2023-03-21 00:00:00+00:00

Outdoor gear retailer Patagonia Inc. has long had a reputation as one of the most environmentally and socially conscious companies in the world.

That was never more clear than in September 2020, when founder Yvon Chouinard gave the $3 billion company away to two nonprofits and committed $100 million of its annual profits towards fighting climate change.

The company is transferring 100% of its voting stock to the Patagonia Purpose Trust, created to uphold the activist values of the company. All of its nonvoting stock will go to the Holdfast Collective, a nonprofit Chouinard described as “dedicated to fighting the environmental crisis and defending nature.”

Chouinard founded the Ventura, Calif.-based company in 1973. The company has stores in more than 10 countries, as well as factories in more than 15 countries. It operates one store in Austin at 316 Congress Ave.

Patagonia CEO Ryan Gellert is in charge of carrying out the mission of transitioning the company to its new ownership. During a South by Southwest keynote event moderated by journalist Katie Couric, he talked about the company's future, which includes a push into the food industry.

Here are some key takeaways from the discussion:

The conversation began with Couric asking Gellert about his background and how he landed at Patagonia in 2014, first spending six years as the company's general manager of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He was named CEO in 2020.

His response: ""I always feel like I'm the last person anyone should ask about career advice. I grew up skateboarding. I grew up around people that built their lives around surfing. Some still bartend around it. How do I build a career when I'm someone who doesn't know what I want to do, but I want to feel passionate about it."" He first landed at outdoor gear maker Black Diamond Equipment before joining Patagonia, where he was drawn by the company's commitment to social and environmental issues.

Couric next asked about Patagonia's transition to new nonprofit ownership. His response was that the company is an ""unapologetically for-profit business."" Regarding the company's commitment to fighting climate change, Gellert said, ""It's a threat to everything we value including the natural world. It's going to take every lever we have to solve it. That's government, it's individuals and it's businesses no longer hiding. I am proud to be part of a for-profit business operating in a segment that needs to change.""

He added, ""We have created the world's problems and they're not solvable without businesses taking responsibility.""

Couric next asked about fast-fashion, in which consumers buy clothing, wear it for a season and discard it. Gellert responded that apparel is one of the most polluting segments in economies. ""There is not enough need in the developing world for all of this stuff. Some of the things we're really focused on are first think before you buy, see yourself as an owner not a consumer.""

Patagonia has long focused on doing product repair and stressing quality products that are sustainable, he said. Whether you bought a jacket two weeks ago or 20 years ago and the zipper breaks, the company will fix it at no charge, he said.

Couric's last round of questions focused on Patagonia's future, which includes expanding its role in the food sector. The company recently made news for purchasing Moonshot, a San Francisco-based startup that makes crackers and snacks with a low-carbon footprint. It was Patagonia's first acquisition in more than two decades.

Gellert said that the agriculture sector is ""one of the most broken"" when it comes to the environment.

He said Patagonia wants to model new environmental stewardship. ""I would love to see that happen. I think we could drive the biggest change in that space.""",['Lori Hawkins'],2023-03-13 00:00:00

A study led by The University of Texas at Austin is providing a glimpse into dinosaur and bird diversity in Patagonia during the Late Cretaceous, just before the non-avian dinosaurs went extinct.

The fossils represent the first record of theropods — a dinosaur group that includes both modern birds and their closest non-avian dinosaur relatives — from the Chilean portion of Patagonia. The researchers’ finds include giant megaraptors with large sickle-like claws and birds from the group that also includes today’s modern species.

“The fauna of Patagonia leading up to the mass extinction was really diverse,” said lead author Sarah Davis, who completed this work as part of her doctoral studies with Professor Julia Clarke at the UT Jackson School of Geosciences Department of Geological Sciences. “You’ve got your large theropod carnivores and smaller carnivores as well as these bird groups coexisting alongside other reptiles and small mammals.”

The study was published in the Journal of South American Earth Sciences.

Since 2017, members of the Clarke lab, including graduate and undergraduate students, have joined scientific collaborators from Chile in Patagonia to collect fossils and build a record of ancient life from the region. Over the years, researchers have found abundant plant and animal fossils from before the asteroid strike that killed off the dinosaurs.

The study focuses specifically on theropods, with the fossils dating from 66 to 75 million years ago.

Non-avian theropod dinosaurs were mostly carnivorous, and include the top predators in the food chain. This study shows that in prehistoric Patagonia, these predators included dinosaurs from two groups — megaraptors and unenlagiines.

Reaching over 25 feet long, megaraptors were among the larger theropod dinosaurs in South America during the Late Cretaceous. The unenlagiines — a group with members that ranged from chicken-sized to over 10 feet tall — were probably covered with feathers, just like their close relative the velociraptor. The unenlagiinae fossils described in the study are the southernmost known instance of this dinosaur group.

The bird fossils were also from two groups — enantiornithines and ornithurines. Although now extinct, enantiornithines were the most diverse and abundant birds millions of years ago. These resembled sparrows — but with beaks lined with teeth. The group ornithurae includes all modern birds living today. The ones living in ancient Patagonia may have resembled a goose or duck, though the fossils are too fragmentary to tell for sure.

The researchers identified the theropods from small fossil fragments; the dinosaurs mostly from teeth and toes, the birds from small bone pieces. Davis said that the enamel glinting on the dinosaur teeth helped with spotting them among the rocky terrain.

Some researchers have suggested that the Southern Hemisphere faced less extreme or more gradual climatic changes than the Northern Hemisphere after the asteroid strike. This may have made Patagonia, and other places in the Southern Hemisphere, a refuge for birds and mammals and other life that survived the extinction. Davis said that this study can aid in investigating this theory by building up a record of ancient life before and after the extinction event.

Study co-author Marcelo Leppe, the director of the Antarctic Institute of Chile, said that these past records are key to understanding life as it exists today.

“We still need to know how life made its way in that apocalyptic scenario and gave rise to our southern environments in South America, New Zealand and Australia,” he said. “Here theropods are still present — no longer as dinosaurs as imposing as megaraptorids — but as the diverse array of birds found in the forests, swamps and marshes of Patagonia, and in Antarctica and Australia.”

The research was funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Agency for Research and Development of Chile, and the Jackson School of Geosciences.

The study’s co-authors include Clarke and researchers at the University of Chile, Major University, the University of Concepción and the Chilean National Museum of Natural History.",[],
https://www.irunfar.com/patagonia-apparel-review,Patagonia Apparel Review,"Patagonia is known for creating some of the highest quality technical outdoor gear that consistently performs exceptionally while emphasizing comfort, classic looks, and a very strong commitment to environmental stewardship and social responsibility. While the upfront cost may be a bit higher than some brands, the durability of the pieces and the ability to repair and rewear are exemplary. I have Patagonia running shorts, fleece, lightweight wind jackets, a puffy or two, and casual wear that are nearly 20 years old, and they’re still comfortably functional and pleasing to my eye.

In this article, we review four pieces of Patagonia apparel currently on the market:

I’m pretty consistently between the small and medium sizes with Patagonia, and I tend to order up because I prefer a looser fit. I’ll highlight where perhaps that wasn’t the right decision with the current line.

While I reviewed only the women’s versions, each item comes in a men’s fit as well, with few differences in design.

Patagonia Wind Shield Pants

I’ve had my eye on the Patagonia Wind Shield Pants ($169) for two years because on cold and windy days, I usually need something a bit more than tights but less than two full layers. This lightweight, stretchy softshell bonded to my favorite Capilene Cool fabric is just the ticket. I’m focusing on performance for this review, but if you’re interested in the technical details of the fabrics used — at least 50% recycled content — check out the website. The pants are available in both women’s and men’s fits.

The cut seems a bit more generous this season in the very best way as someone who has, shall we say, well-developed mountain climbing glutes, thighs, and calves. The optimal temperature range for running in these for me is somewhere between 15 and 45 degrees Fahrenheit. At 45 degrees F, they can be warm if it’s a bright, sun-ball kind of day, but add some biting north wind or some clouds, and they regulate optimally due to the wisely placed breathable panels of Patagonia Peak Mission Tights fabric along the lateral legs and behind the knees. Below 15 degrees F, I simply add a pair of tight shorts and taller socks to layer up where I tend to get chilly. I have gone as low as -5 degrees F this season, and I added a down running skirt, which slid on over the smooth face without resistance.

For kicks and giggles, I also wore these for a 90-minute run in 34 degrees F and sideways “snain,” which is that lovely mix of driving rain and snow with perhaps a few icy bits mixed in. They performed admirably, keeping the 25-mile-per-hour wind out and allowing me to be as comfortable as possible in nasty conditions, but they did get a bit heavier due to the significant rain content. That being said, they moved enough moisture out that there wasn’t enough in them to actually ring out by the end. Obviously, that wasn’t exactly the target weather conditions for the pants, but if it were the only option I packed for a trip, I’d totally wear them again. These pants aren’t designed to be super-warm, sub-zero pants, but they do such an amazing job of cutting the wind, sloughing off light moisture, remaining breathable, and allowing full motion — and therefore speed — that somehow they create a little microclimate that is warmer and more protective than their weight would indicate as being possible.

Optimal comfort and technical function are further achieved via the wide, soft, stretchy waistband with the external drawcord, which prevents any friction against the mid-section skin. Side pockets on either side of the hips swallow most phones, snacks, keys, extra gloves, and even a small headlamp. I’d love to see a small zippered pocket for a key in the small of the back like most Patagonia running bottoms have, but with the side thigh pockets, it’s less necessary. The ankles have a tall, gusseted zipper to facilitate easier on/off, and while I can get them over a pair of shoes, I still find it simpler just to be in sock feet. This zipper is helpful with heat management without sacrificing protection from snow and splash-back if the temperatures ramp up during your run. Lastly, the durable water repellent (DWR) finish on the softshell allows most snow to slough off, even if you’re taking regular hits from snowshoe tails or fat bike falls.

I tried both the small and medium Patagonia Wind Shield Pants on in a store, and the small pants fit more like leggings and restrict knee flexion and high step-ups. They’re also tighter than I prefer around the calves, though comfortable through the waist and hips. The side pockets on the small truly are no bounce. The medium fits a little more like running pants, and I have room to layer tall socks and tight shorts beneath. The calves are roomy enough, and there is zero restriction to any steep climbing, scrambly moves, or high leg lifts for fat bike rides where you routinely forget you have a dropper post. Regardless of how far I run, they do not sag, slip, or fall down — rather miraculous overall. I do get a little bounce in the side pockets if carrying the weight of a phone, but without a doubt, the mediums are my preferred size. I’m 5 feet, 5 inches, and they completely cover my ankle bones with a bit left over, but someone on the taller end of the spectrum may appreciate a longer length.

Summary: I. Love. These. Pants.

Patagonia Airshed Pro Pullover

I purchased the first version of the Patagonia Airshed Pro Pullover ($139) a couple of years ago as I searched for that illusive super lightweight wind layer that had magical breathability and protection, didn’t cause overheating, and squished to nothing when stowed. It was so light I found it hard to trust at first. Suffice it to say, many hundreds of miles later, it’s on my must-pack checklist for all mountain adventures in the spring, summer, and fall. The current rendition of the Patagonia Airshed Pro Pullover is available in both a men’s and women’s specific fit, is super light, and can stuff into a long, thin pocket sewn into the hood.

There are no other pockets on the garment at all, which is wise with how light it is. The deep, two-way, unobtrusive zipper (with a thin garage to protect skin) in the front facilitates venting, regardless of whether the hood is snugly on your head or not. This has been a pretty key function up on high, windy ridges. I feel like the thin, Capilene Cool lightweight scuba hood provides a cone of protection for my head and face, while the deep zipper lets me easily regulate internal temperature. It allows for fewer clothing changes as temperatures swing. The forearms and a panel to the underarms are made from the same material, thus facilitating breathability and the sliding of sleeves up and down with ease. The sleeves are wonderfully long — my hands fit completely up inside without any pull across the back for those days when one pair of gloves isn’t quite enough, but you don’t need the second layer for long.

The body of the Patagonia Airshed Pro Pullover has a unique texture and feel — the ultra-lightweight 100% nylon stretch taffeta with durable water repellent allows unhindered movement, but there’s almost a crispness to it that clearly levels up the performance and takes the edge off the wind. Once you have it on and you’re cruising in the elements, it all makes sense. Compared to the former Patagonia Airshed 1/4-Zip Pullover Wind Shirt, which I also have and love, it is a bit less soft but a better technical performer.

So where exactly does the Patagonia Airshed Pro Pullover fit in the grand scheme of things? In Patagonia’s technical high-endurance-output line, it’s part of an integrated system designed specifically for mountain running that minimizes clothing changes and keeps pack weight low. In my personal gear collection, I use this over a short sleeve technical top when light wind protection is favored over warmth. It’s a piece I can wear all day most days when I’m up high because of the venting and breathability, and I love not having to take a less breathable option on and off several times throughout the day. On cooler days, it’s a great light-wind layer in conjunction with insulation, especially thanks to the superb scuba hood. Now, if it’s freezing, blowing a gale, and I’m bashing through willows, there are better and more sturdy protective pieces. So, is this essential? No, but is it incredible if you run on the warm side and just need a bit more than a base layer? Absolutely.

Size-wise, my past season version is a medium, which fits beautifully, stays down around my hips and waist, and accommodates my layering preferences. This new version is also medium and may be a bit roomier in the body, but I wouldn’t change a thing. If you’re in between sizes, you may want to size up based on comments from some users on the website, who found the sizing to be slim through the hips.

We like this jacket so much that we’ve named it the best hybrid jacket for winter running in our Cold Weather Running Gear guide.

Patagonia Ridge Flow Shirt

The Patagonia Ridge Flow Shirt ($59) is made of a highly breathable, moisture-wicking jacquard fabric that is oh, so soft, loosely skims over the body, and dries even before you realize it’s damp. In the women’s shirt, a cap sleeve provides a bit of sun protection with maximum shoulder mobility — a great lifting/spinning/high-intensity workout option. There’s a large keyhole design mid-back to improve venting and provide an aesthetic detail. I may be in the minority, but I can’t imagine why a large hole in the mid-back is desirable under any circumstances, but to its credit, there is no chafing created while wearing any of my hydration packs, so I suppose I’ll accept it … and make sure I never wear it sans pack outside and risk a very odd sunburn. The men’s shirt with standard short sleeves does not have this detail.

I find the sizing difference between the small and medium Patagonia Ridge Flow Shirt to be very similar to the various Capilene Cool running shirts. The small gives me a more tailored fit but still plenty of length, and the medium is roomier and breezier, with more flexibility through the shoulders — I prefer the medium.

Patagonia Micro D 1/4-Zip Fleece

This classic, clean Patagonia Micro D 1/4-Zip Fleece ($69) has been in the Patagonia insulation line in some form for as long as I can remember — in both a men’s and a women’s version. I can attest to the longevity of such a piece, as I have one from the last century that is still cozy and wearable — at under $70, it’s an incredible value piece.

Micro D fabric is a fine pile, 100% recycled microfleece that is ultra soft and feels incredible, whether over a sports bra or casual shirt in an everyday setting. The stand-up double fleece collar keeps the elements out with the zipper up, and the chin stays protected via a subtle zipper garage. The length extends to the hips, which allows for full arm motions without any midriff-exposing surprises. While I prefer lounging and adulting in this fleece, simply because it’s so lovely, it excels as a high warmth-weight ratio insulation layer for lift-served ski days and stop-start activities where warmth is a prime focus. Though it may not be what it was designed for, I survived several years in the wintry rain of western Oregon with an earlier version of this fleece as my frequent choice of outerwear — it retains heat even when wet, breathes well, and dries relatively quickly as long as the rain isn’t too heavy, so it was about perfect for the dark, early morning daily runs. Technical rain gear has come a long way since then, so my Patagonia Micro D 1/4-Zip Fleece is firmly back in the warm, dry insulation category, however.

Based on history and past purchases, I confidently chose the medium and found that the small would have been a better fit. Both have excellent arm mobility and length, such that I can pull my hands up inside and give myself a hug, but the medium has significantly more room through the body and shoulders, such that sizing down is the better option. Will it stop me from wearing this lusciousness? Absolutely not. This is one of the coziest fleece tops in my collection, and it’s refined enough to achieve “Colorado dressy” in almost any non-athletic setting. You simply can’t beat the value of this cozy, long-lasting, classic piece.

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230119005230/en/NEXT-Energy-Technologies-Installs-Energy-Generating-Windows-on-Outdoor-Retailer-Patagonia%E2%80%99s-Headquarters,NEXT Energy Technologies Installs Energy-Generating Windows on Outdoor Retailer Patagonia’s Headquarters,"VENTURA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NEXT Energy Technologies has installed windows that are generating solar power at Patagonia’s corporate headquarters, marking the first time NEXT’s window technology is being demonstrated on a building and furthering Patagonia’s commitment to using business to implement solutions to the environmental crisis.

NEXT developed a proprietary transparent photovoltaic (PV) coating that transforms commercial windows into energy-generating windows. Patagonia, the outdoor apparel company based in Ventura, worked with NEXT to install 22 of the windows on the south-facing facade of the Olive Building on Patagonia’s main campus. The building houses offices, an employee gym and climbing wall. The windows are a production demonstration of how NEXT’s transparent solar technology can be seamlessly integrated into commercial buildings to generate electricity to power the building and alleviate strain on the grid.

NEXT’s windows installed at Patagonia deliver dedicated power to the building for charging phones and other devices while employees use the community spaces. Employees also have access to proprietary metrics with real-time power output and charging information to inform users of the benefits of the windows.

Partners in Creating Better Buildings for Tomorrow

NEXT estimates that its windows are capable of producing 20-30% of the power produced by conventional solar panels alone. However, by leveraging the underutilized surface area of the building facade, as opposed to isolated rooftops, NEXT’s windows have the potential to produce significant onsite renewable power, offsetting anywhere from 10-40% of a typical commercial building’s energy load. The windows also capture and convert infrared light, which reduces the building’s heat load and further alleviates the existing strain on a building’s power infrastructure.

“Deploying this technology with Patagonia, one of the most respected brands in sustainability, is a huge milestone for us. It demonstrates Patagonia’s commitment to leading by example on climate change and shines a light on innovations that can help commercial buildings achieve net-zero energy and sustainability goals,” said Daniel Emmett, CEO and co-founder of NEXT Energy Technologies. “We’re grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with Patagonia to demonstrate our technology in action and share the numerous benefits to building owners, developers and occupants, including reduced operating expenses, increased building value, improved building resilience, relieved pressure and reliance on the grid, and reduced carbon footprint.”

“Global building stock is expected to double by 2060, and if transparent PV windows can be deployed widely on buildings during this timeframe, they have the potential to reduce GHG emissions from the built environment by over 1 gigaton per year, a huge opportunity for climate impact,” Emmett continued.

“We’ve been using solar power at our headquarters in Ventura since 2005 and at our Reno Distribution Center since 1996,” said Corley Kenna, head of Communications and Public Policy at Patagonia. “We rely on 100% renewable electricity for our owned and operated facilities in the United States and 76% globally, achieved through on-site and off-site installations. We have funded more than 1,000 solar arrays on homes across the U.S. and have helped install more than 600 kilowatts of solar power globally to support agriculture. Finding better ways of doing business is something we always strive to do and we’re pleased to partner with NEXT Energy to help us be a more responsible company.”

Printing Photovoltaic Film

Partners on this project include Walters & Wolf, who designed, fabricated, and installed the glazing system integrating NEXT’s energy-harvesting windows. The glass fabricator of the module units was performed by SolarFab, a division of GlassFab Tempering Services. NEXT’s windows are created by printing a transparent photovoltaic coating directly onto architectural glass. The coating is then sealed behind a secondary sheet of glass and subsequently integrated into a traditional glazing system which carries cables that deliver renewable energy to be used onsite in the building.

“We spent years of R&D to design façade systems for Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV). The dream of a seamless plug and play BIPV façade is a reality, we are all very excited for the possibilities,” said Shiloh Kocelj, BIPV Director of Walters & Wolf.

This installation is the first time that NEXT has demonstrated its technology on the facade of a building. This project follows the demonstration of three other freestanding facade units containing the window technology, one each in Santa Barbara, CA, Fremont, CA, and Paris, France.

https://www.modernretail.co/operations/with-patagonia-leading-the-pack-whats-next-for-sustainability-in-apparel/,"With Patagonia leading the pack, what’s next for sustainability in apparel?","Back in 2011, Patagonia placed an ad in the New York Times on Black Friday with a photo of one of its products and a provocative message: “Don’t Buy This Jacket.”

The move, part of a larger poster and PR campaign, was meant to encourage people to think about the environmental impact of their purchases. In a post on its website explaining the ad, Patagonia announced it was “time for us as a company to address the issue of consumerism and do it head on.” “Everything we make takes something from the planet we can’t give back,” it said.

Fast forward 11 years, and Patagonia once again made headlines, this time for its founder saying he would essentially give the company away to aid in the fight against climate change, transferring ownership of the nearly $3 billion business to an environmental trust (the Patagonia Purpose Trust) and a nonprofit (Holdfast Collective). “I never wanted to be a businessman,” Yvon Chouinard wrote in an online letter with the subhead “Earth is now our only shareholder.”

Many critics hailed the move as groundbreaking, especially in the apparel industry, where fast fashion has a tremendous environmental and social cost. Others pointed out that Chouinard’s decision was a “convenient way to avoid taxes,” as Quartz put it. Either way, it’s a big step for Patagonia, a nearly 50-year-old company that has spent years publicly acknowledging the apparel industry’s impact on the environment.

In 1996, Patagonia began using organically grown cotton, and in 2014 it formed a partnership with Fair Trade USA, which Patagonia says has “impacted more than 75,000 workers in 10 countries around the globe.” In 2017, Patagonia launched a permanent version of its resale program “Worn Wear,” and in 2019, it was named a United Nations Champion of the Earth. Now, Patagonia is working towards becoming climate neutral across its entire business, including its supply chain, by 2025.

Today, fashion brands big and small are under mounting pressure to step up their sustainability efforts and practice ethical sourcing. In the European Union, this pressure largely comes from regulators, which have signed into law a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In the U.S., where inflation is high, the number of consumers willing to buy goods like apparel, footwear and accessories is down nearly 16%, compared to 2019. In addition, three-quarters of Gen Z shoppers, the newest coveted customer demographic, say they would spend 10% more on sustainable products. As fashion brands plot ways to overcome softening demand, progressing on sustainability — whether fundamentally changing the structure of the company (in the case of Patagonia) or overhauling the supply chain — could help boost a brand’s image and its sales.

But, while Chouinard’s decision to give away Patagonia will help keep his legacy alive, it’s unlikely that we’ll see other apparel companies take such drastic measures, said Sucharita Kodali, a retail analyst at Forrester.

“This kind of thing happens because of, usually, an individual’s passion,” she said. “Most business people are not passionate in this way, and very few… are successful in this way. I just don’t see it being in the cards. I mean, this is a choice, and given a choice between profit… versus being a missionary CEO, most of them will pick get rich quick or get rich big.”

The key for apparel companies lies in “what they do and what they say,” Kodali said. “Truly sustainable actions are going to be about the reduction in consumption, not the increase in consumption… It’s a challenge for all of these companies, because the only solution is to actually raise your prices and produce less.”

A problem of waste

The apparel industry as a whole generates tremendous waste, especially in the U.S., where 85% of textiles ended up in landfills or were burned in 2018, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. According to the World Bank, the fashion industry was responsible for 10% of annual global carbon emissions in 2019, “more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined.”

“This is not only a waste problem — it’s a resource problem, given the vast amount of energy, water, chemicals, land and labor needed to produce all those garments,” Kelly Pedersen, U.S. retail leader at PwC, said in an email to Modern Retail.

“To address this, leading brands have begun to focus on improving product quality, durability and recyclability, all the while pursuing more circular business models like repair-as-a-service, secondhand and vintage resale,” he explained.

Many apparel and footwear companies have either launched or grown such initiatives in 2022. Rothy’s, which has already converted millions of single-use plastic water bottles into shoes, began a shoe and bag takeback program. Eddie Bauer expanded its (Re)Adventure program to include resale. The North Face, which first launched a resale program in 2018, unveiled its first slate of circular design products. And Wrangler and PacSun both launched lines of secondhand apparel.

For recycling, upcycling and secondhand, “it’s clear that we are in a test phase,” Matteo Capellini, an associate partner at Bain & Co. who advises fashion companies on ESG (environmental, social and governance) strategies, told Modern Retail. “We are also in a phase where it’s very important for brands to say they’re doing something in this regard, but when we look at the big scheme of things, the volumes are clearly not there yet. So, I think that recycling programs are important, but probably what will be the real focus going forward is how you build the product in order to be able to recycle it properly.”

For outerwear companies like Patagonia, this can come back to the question of, “What’s the impact of your product throughout their lifecycle?” he said. “To me, outerwear has a huge question about the real circularity of their products, the kind of raw material used and how the end of life of the product is imagined at the inception of the product.”

Many brands are announcing new, sustainable products — On Running, for example, launched a shoe made from captured carbon emissions — but without proper regulation, it’s difficult to know how effective these types of initiatives would be in the long-term, and to what degree apparel and footwear companies are dabbling in “greenwashing.”

New certifications and regulations

Patagonia is one of many apparel companies establishing carbon-neutrality targets in the wake of the Paris Climate Agreement. Today, 59 fashion brands including Reformation, Vuori and Allbirds are already certified carbon neutral.

More regulations are being introduced across all industries. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission plans to require companies to report climate-related risks to their own operations, like the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in their supply chain, when they submit certain filings. (The process is still months away from being finalized, and companies are currently gathering up emissions data.)

In the meantime, the European Union, a long-time leader in climate policy, voted to finalize the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which would “make businesses more publicly accountable by obliging them to regularly disclose information on their societal and environmental impact,” according to a press release. Non-E.U. companies that do certain levels of business in the E.U. may also be required to produce reports in compliance with E.U. rules.

For companies adapting more sustainable practices, “it’s a balance of being proactive and not getting caught flat-footed, but also realizing that there’s a lot of uncertainty,” Ben Herskowitz, then-managing director and now-senior managing director in FTI Consulting’s ESG & Sustainability section, told Modern Retail. “That’s where I think the challenges have been for a lot of our clients, knowing what the appropriate pace is and how to move forward so that you maintain optionality.”

While also meeting broader targets, each apparel and footwear company has to personalize its sustainability strategy, Pedersen pointed out. A company that makes denim products will need to address water use and dyeing processes, for example, while a footwear company will have to think about the consequences of leather use.

Ultimately, for the apparel industry, “improvements have been made constantly,” Bain’s Capellini said. “But we have to also acknowledge where we stand, and it is not in a very good shape, because this industry is still in a phase where setting goals and ambition has more value than delivering on it… I would say that there is progress, but it’s not definitely enough versus the order of magnitude of change that this industry is looking for.”",['Julia Waldow'],2023-01-04 05:00:17+00:00
https://agfundernews.com/why-patagonia-provisions-bought-moonshot-its-the-best-impact-story-of-a-food-business-ive-ever-come-across,Why Patagonia Provisions bought Moonshot Snacks,"Patagonia Provisions, the food and bev arm of outdoor outfitter Patagonia, has acquired snack brand Moonshot for an undisclosed sum.

This is Patagonia’s first acquisition in more than 20 years.

Moonshot makes crackers using regenerative agriculture practices and shorter supply chains with the goal of giving its products a lower carbon footprint.

Chance encounters

The deal came about rather by chance, Patagonia Provisions’ general manager Paul Lightfoot tells AFN. His company discovered Moonshot while working with the latter’s parent company, PlanetFWD, which makes a software tool brands can use to calculate their carbon footprints and improve the environmental impact of their products.

“We did not set out with an acquisition strategy,” he says, adding that Patagonia Provisions is not currently pursuing one.

“When they [PlanetFWD] showed us what they did for food businesses with regenerative supply chains, they had a showcase company, which was Moonshot.”

The Patagonia Provisions team immediately “fell in love” with Moonshot’s supplier ecosystem, which is built around the concept of shorter supply chains (and therefore lower emissions from transportation) and more traceable ingredients. Moonshot says its wheat is grown on regenerative organic farms just two miles away from the mill where it becomes flour. That mill is about 85 miles from the bakery that turns the flour into Moonshot’s crackers.

The startup also uses growing practices such as no-till, cover cropping and crop rotation, which can improve soil health.

Lightfoot says the other major factor drawing Patagonia Provisions to the company was “the amazing group of women that have built this business,” including PlanetFWD founder Julia Collins.

“I founded Moonshot with the vision of using the power of food to help tackle climate change,” Collins said in a recent statement. “By joining Patagonia Provisions, who recently made Earth their only shareholder, Moonshot now belongs to the planet. I cannot imagine a more spectacular path forward for our mission, our team and our Climatarian community.”

‘Committed to producing food responsibly’

Anyone who’s tried products from Patagonia Provisions and Moonshot knows these foods sell for what’s typically a higher price point than the average American snack. Lightfoot says he thinks about this question of accessibility constantly.

“Access to food that’s good to your health and good to the planet is a fundamental basic right,” he says. “That said, we’re not apologetic about doing things in a way that often costs more because it’s the right thing to do.”

Like Moonshot, Patagonia provisions in organic, regeneratively grown/raised foods that are often more expensive to produce.

At the same time, Lightfoot says the standard American diet is produced in a way “that doesn’t capture the actual cost to society,” including the cost to human health and to the environment.

For now, Patagonia Provisions will “continue to produce foods responsibly” by providing greater long-term value via nutrition and environmentally friendly practices.

Mackerel, for example, is typically caught by trawling, which can impair sea environments and damage ecosystems.

Patagonia Provisions uses a technique involving bait-less hooks that “is more costly but could go on for a thousand years without damaging the ecosystem,” says Lightfoot.

“We don’t have a choice but to pass on the higher cost, but we think it’s worth it when so much of the seafood around the world is really destructive.”

Driving demand for regen ag

He’s hopeful, however, that the issue of accessibility will change over time. Companies like Moonshot, he says, are an important part of the process.

“Flat-screen TVs, electric vehicles, anything done in an innovative way is going to cost more in the beginning,” he says. “As it scales, the costs come down.”

Moonshot currently sells its crackers at retailers in the US like Whole Foods, The Fresh Market, and Bristol Farms. Becoming part of Patagonia Provisions could, of course, widen the company’s geographical reach considerably.

“Moonshot is pretty small scale right now,” says Lightfoot. “My hope is that these [kinds of] companies create such demand for regenerative that there’s a really big market and it will bring costs down.”",[],2023-03-09 17:12:48+00:00
https://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/postcard-from-argentina-my-hiking-trip-to-patagonia-in-photos,Argentina: My hiking trip to Patagonia,"Trail-loving Lonely Planet senior editor Melissa Yeager recently returned from a spectacular hiking trip from a lesser-visited park in Argentine Patagonia. She has a few ideas on why this should be on your radar to escape the crowds.

Shortly after Lonely Planet contributor Evan Ruderman took on the Chilean side of Patagonia, I visited the Argentina side. Lesser known and with fewer visitors, Parque Patagonia Argentina's landscape is starkly different from its Chilean counterparts. At first glance from the road of Hwy 40 that takes visitors through Patagonia, you really can't see what makes this area so special.

But enter the Portal Cañadón Pinturas and hike on the newly marked trails and you'll witness the spectacular beauty of this area and share it with very few others.

Over a five-day visit to the park, I put dozens of miles on my hiking boots and exponentially more pictures of wildlife and nature on my iPhone and DSLR.

Patagonia is a dream for hikers © Melissa Yeager / Lonely Planet

I usually start the day in Parque Patagonia Argentina...

With a hike. Patagonia is a dream for hikers, and Parque Patagonia Argentina has put in 10 new trails ranging from 2-18 km with sweeping views of both landscape and wildlife.

My two favorite trails involved hiking down and up the Cañadón Pinturas as well as checking out the rainbow-colored oxidation seen at Sendero Tierra de Colores.

In Parque Patagonia, Argentina I stayed...

In the park. With the nearest town some 60 kilometers away, the best place to stay is within the park itself. The La Posta de los Toldos Refugio's rooms are rustic yet comfortable, but its charming common area, with hospitality as warm as its hearth, make it feel like a luxurious place to return to after a day hiking. Walking distance from the lodge is a heated observatory. The stone walls will keep out the wind as you stargaze.

If you'd rather camp under the stars, I spent one night experiencing the campsites, surrounded by walls to keep out the near-constant wind.

In Parque Patagonia Argentina, you must try...

Food and drink. The food and wine were as equally spectacular as the Patagonian landscape. You have to experience a traditional Asado, Argentina's take on barbecue. Sample the chorizo and other slow-roasted carne along with sipping the local beer and wine (which likely will come from the nearby Mendoza wine region).

Don't miss...

The archaeological wonders of the area. You can't miss the colorful walls of Cueva de las Manos or ""Cave of the Hands,"" which are a Unesco World Heritage site. Hike down to see handprints and rock paintings of wildlife that experts believe date back more than 9000 years.

You can also book a private tour to hike to an equally impressive site called Alero Charcamata. The paintings are located on private land, but guide Claudio Figuera with Zoyen Tourism has an agreement with the rancher to lead tours on the property. You'll need to be able to hike 2km to get there, but you'll have plenty of time to rest and enjoy lunch once you get there while Figuera tells you about the history of this site.

The park will present you with many excellent photo opportunities © Melissa Yeager / Lonely Planet

As a souvenir, you should bring back...

Photos and memories. You're going to see spectacular wildlife. Guanacos grazing, viscacha sunning themselves on cliffs, perhaps you'll even spot a puma. (You can book a tour with Falcuno Epul, the man who monitors pumas within the park, and learn about how he tracks the species as the park works to grow the predator's population.)

Take lots of pictures but observe the practices of Leave No Trace. Don't leave anything in or take anything from this fragile ecosystem. Leave it so others who come after you can enjoy its beauty.

The items I recommend bringing to Parque Patagonia Argentina are...

Nano-puff jacket and a hat. The locals describe the weather in Patagonia as ""four seasons in one day,"" and I found that enormously true even at the height of summer. At the top of the canyon, I'd have my Patagonia brand nano-puff zipped with the hood firmly around my ears. (Yes, I did feel a bit like I was wearing a concert t-shirt to the concert – but Patagonia and North Face gear are prolific here due to the warmth and durability of the products.)

But make sure you layer as well. By the time we reached the bottom of the canyon, I'd ditched the layers and slathered myself with sunscreen. Returning to the top, with the ever-present wind whipping around us, I was back in my nano-puff.

Finally, the sustainable ecolodge runs on solar energy, which means it can handle hair dryers. Pack a hat to manage your wild locks.

https://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/reason-to-travel-patagonia-argentina,A new national park is a great reason to visit Argentine Patagonia,"Looking for a great reason to start planning your next adventure? Here’s why you should visit Argentine Patagonia this year.

If you tell people you are headed to Patagonia, they may immediately assume you’re headed to Chile. And that’s one of the many reasons you should consider stopping in this under-visited spot in Argentina to see the massive – and exciting – rewilding effort taking place in this part of Patagonia.

Explore the planet’s most surprising adventures with our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.

Outdoors lovers tend to flock to the more popular, established parks in Chile. Meanwhile, my cab driver in Buenos Aires who was shuttling us to the airport was visibly confused, insisting I had confused Perito Moreno, the glacier, with Perito Moreno, the town in Argentina. (You’ll find the name Perito Moreno all over Patagonia, as it pays tribute to Francisco “Perito” Moreno, who donated land and helped spur the formation of the first of Argentina’s national parks.)

Yet what’s clear is the tremendous momentum happening on this part of the Patagonia steppe at the relatively new Parque Patagonia Argentina, which has a landscape vastly different from that of neighboring Chile. The views are equally stunning, and will enchant outdoors enthusiasts for entirely different reasons.

The walls of Cueva de las Manos in Patagonia, Argentina © Melissa Yeager / Lonely Planet

Parque Patagonia Argentina, part of which has been designated a national park since 2014, has included the land that includes the Cañadón Pinturas Portal section in 2019. Visitors have long been drawn to the area’s archaeological sites and this newest portal provides access to one of the most popular: Cueva de las Manos or “Cave of the Hands.” The colorful walls of this part of the Unesco World Heritage Site are covered in handprints and rock paintings of wildlife that experts believe date back more than 9000 years.

The area surrounding Cueva de las Manos was formerly ranchland, a use that drove out a lot of the native species in the area. Today, a massive rewilding effort, led by the Freyja Foundation and Rewilding Argentina, is underway. The project is gradually transforming the land back to its natural state by reestablishing wildlife, such as the area’s top predator: the puma.

The growing Portal Cañadón Pinturas area of the park has exciting new features, such as lodging and outdoor activities to help overnight visitors to enjoy the protected land. Volunteers have put in 10 new trails, including ones that will reward you with a breathtaking view of Tierra de Colores, or another that will have you trekking through the Pinturas canyon.

Other amenities include a lodge and new campgrounds. The Elsa Rosenvasser Feher Planetarium and Interpretation Centre is scheduled to open in November 2023, when the park opens for the summer season. The facility, which will include exhibits and activities for kids like a rock-climbing wall, is named after the Argentine scientist who donated the money for the facility.

The dream is eventually to have the parks on both sides of the international border stitched together into a larger wildlife sanctuary – but this dream is facing political headwinds from both the region and the federal government. Both would both need to pass laws to incorporate land acquired by this public-private effort into the national park.

Still, this is an area that many people used to speed past on Hwy 40 on their way to other protected parks in the area. With all the new trails and amenities, there’s a reason to slow down to make this growing national park a stop on your Patagonia road trip – and gain a new perspective on the area.

Where to stay

The nearest town, Perito Moreno, is some 61km away. As an alternative, you’ll save time (and gas) when you stay inside the park at Refugio La Posta de los Toldos. The food and hospitality make the rustic lodge feel luxurious, and you’ll wake up to wildlife like guanacos and lesser rheas casually strutting by. Since the sustainable lodge runs on solar power, you won’t be able to use your hair dryer – but I promise the guanacos won’t judge your wild locks.

If you’re more adventurous or have rented a camper van, stay at one of the park’s campsites (which have barriers to block out Patagonia’s near-constant wind). A small snack bar with beer and tasty post-hike snacks is located near one of the campsites.

What to see

Nightlife here means heading to the on-site observatory. Just a short walk from the lodge, the stone structure is heated and designed to keep out the wind. With no light pollution, this is a comfortable place to gaze at constellations like the Southern Cross from the perspective of the Southern Hemisphere.

The park is working to reintroduce pumas to the ecosystem – and a major contributor to this effort is Falcuno Epul, a former ranch worker who the park has retrained to help track, monitor and collect data on the pumas. Epul also works as a wildlife-watching guide. He will help you learn about his job and the park’s effort to reestablish pumas in the park. And if you’re lucky, you just might spot a puma in the wild during the trip.

When Kris Tompkins gave up her job as CEO of the Patagonia clothing company 30 years ago, she had no idea her life would one day be featured in a documentary film by Oscar-winning filmmakers.

Filmmakers and close friends Jimmy Chin and Chai Vasarhelyi were drawn to Tompkins' remarkable life when they created, ""Wild Life."" The duo previously won an Oscar for their film ""Free Solo"" about famed climber Alex Honnold's ascent of El Capitan in Yosemite.

""I've always wanted to make a film about a strong female protagonist and Kris is that in spades, and I think especially when her third act came you really see a woman find her voice,"" Vasarhelyi said.

The documentary ""Wild Life"" chronicles the life of Kris Tompkins, who began her career in 1973 working with her friend Yvon Chouinard at his climbing equipment company, which later evolved into Patagonia. She served as Patagonia's first CEO for 14 years until she met Doug Tompkins, co-founder of The North Face and Esprit. After leaving the fashion industry in the early 90s, Doug convinced Kris to join him in Chile, where they began devoting their lives and wealth to buying up vast tracts of land in the Patagonia region at the southern end of South America.

""On a Friday I retired and two days later, on Sunday, with two little bags I closed up my beach house and moved to a roadless area on the coast of Chile,"" she said.

""Wild Life"" tells the story of how Doug and Kris Tompkins spent a significant portion of their lives and wealth purchasing vast amounts of land in Patagonia. Their efforts, chronicled in the film, led to the formation of parks in the region.

The couple never intended to keep the land for themselves. Through their organization, Tompkins Conservation, they became some of the largest private land donors in the world, protecting what Kris Tompkins calls the ""crown jewels"" of Patagonia for everyone to enjoy.

Then, in 2015, Doug Tompkins was killed in a kayaking accident, leaving Kris shattered.

""Losing Doug was the worst thing that could happen to me. In the shadow of that, you realize you have no fear and that makes you absolutely free to take on anything,"" Kris Tompkins said.

Her fearlessness has driven her work, as seen in her efforts to secure even more land and reintroduce native species such as pumas and jaguars. Additionally, she handed over land for five more national parks to the president of Chile in 2018, making it one of the biggest private land donations in history.

""It was the purest sense of joy I think I ever have experienced,"" she said.

At the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, in March, Tompkins watched the documentary for the first time, at the age of 72. Despite her age, she feels she still has a lot more work to do.

""My intention is to do this work until I drop dead,"" she said. ""So we're just getting warmed up.""",[],

Before purchasing your new jacket, the first thing to consider is its intended use and the weather conditions it will face. Is insulation or breathability more important (as more of one means less of the other)? Perhaps you need a fully waterproof model, or just a wind-resistant version will suffice. Lastly, we have found that most Patagonia jackets run large, so if in doubt, size down.

Patagonia's purple, orange, and black logo depicting the Fitzroy Massif in Patagonia is synonymous with excellent craftsmanship and rigorous dedication to conserving the planet through environmental and political activism . Considered one of, if not the leading maker of outdoor apparel and gear, their outerwear is worn by some of the world's best athletes in the most extreme weather conditions.

What to Look for When Shopping for a Patagonia Jacket

Best Overall Patagonia Nano Puff® Hoody 5 Courtesy of Patagonia View On Backcountry.com View On Patagonia.com View On REI What We Like Broad temperature usability

Excellent warmth to weight ratio

Small pack size What We Don't Like Thin shell can puncture easily The Nano Puff is Patagonia's number-one selling jacket, and rightfully so. Simply put, its versatility and usability are second to none. It's almost an all-season coat for the Western US. The medium-weight 60-g PrimaLoft Gold Insulation is perfect as a standalone jacket in shoulder season or as a mid-layer under a hardshell for days on the snow. The shell is made with a DWR-treated lightweight 100 percent recycled polyester ripstop and is said to be windproof and water-resistant. The Nano Puff provides adequate warmth well into temps in the 30s, but under that, you may want a few layers or something thicker like Patagonia's DAS Hoody (see below). In High Sierra conditions, the Nano Puff had excellent wind protection in downright cold and nasty alpine winds. As for water resistance, well, it's resistant, but certainly not waterproof. That's an important distinction. In drizzle and snowfall, it holds up just fine, but beyond that, moisture starts to penetrate, and things can turn nasty. For warmth, I found it had great range. I was comfortable in it, from just below freezing to mildly chilly California evenings. For bitter cold days at Mammoth, it was my go-to midlayer. If you're like me, you'll reach for this jacket more than any other one in your closet.

Best Fleece Patagonia R1 Air Full-Zip Hoody Backcountry View On Backcountry.com View On Patagonia.com View On REI What We Like Highly breathable

Trim fit

Comfortable against the skin What We Don't Like Pills very easily The 11 Best Fleece Jackets for Women of 2023 This one is our favorite of all the Patagonia pieces we've tested. It combines the technical chops of our favorite alpine climbing piece, the classic R1, with the coziness of Patagonia's Better Sweater. Designed for high-output activities, it's a bit airier (hence the ""air"" namesake) than most fleeces, but if you're moving quickly, you'll welcome its superb breathability. The 100 percent recycled polyester jacquard fleece features a distinctive zigzag pattern that gives the R1 Air better breathability and moisture-wicking capabilities than your typical fleece. Unlike most Patagonia jackets listed here, the fit is athletic and snug, with long sleeves. Of every jacket and fleece in my closet—and I have a ton—the R1 Air gets used the most. I practically live in this fleece. As someone who heats up extremely quickly when moving and gets cold just as quickly once I stop, I always struggle with jackets either being too hot or too cold. The R1 Air's thermal regulation range is phenomenal—the best I've ever tested. It's a perfect medium between warmth and breathability. I wear this walking the dog, hiking into the crag, as a ski mid-layer, and whenever it's chilly out. Being built like a runner, I appreciate the slim fit. It fits snugly against the skin and zips high enough to cover my neck.

Small pack-down size

Thinness sacrifices warmth The Best Raincoats for Women That Shield You From Storms If you're the type that measures your gear's weight in ounces and size in centimeters, the Patagonia Micro Puff Hooded Jacket is for you. This featherweight, lightly insulated jacket packs down to the size of two soda cans and weighs just 9.3 ounces. The shell is made with ultralight Pertex Quantum 100 percent nylon ripstop with a DWR coating that's mildly windproof and water-resistant. The Micro Puff gets its packability and lightweight stature thanks to synthetic PlumaFill insulation, while the unique off-set checkered stitching pattern keeps the PlumaFill from shifting and creating dead loft spaces. I've had a rocky relationship with this jacket. Hands down, it's the most packable and lightest insulated jacket on the market. This was my go-to layering option for chilly climbing days when pack space was at a premium. What I struggle with is how thin it is. For someone who gets cold when not moving, it didn't provide enough warmth for extended time standing around belaying. If I wasn't layered up, I started to get cold in temperatures under 45 degrees, especially if there was wind. It's worth mentioning I found the sizing to be extremely large. I'm normally a men's small, but extra small fit me perfectly with the Micro Puff. Price at time of publication: $329 Sizes: S to XXL | Materials: Netplus (10D 100 percent recycled nylon ripstop from fishing nets), PFC-free DWR finish (fabric), 65 grams PlumaFill (100 percent recycled polyester) | Sustainability: Recycled and repurposed materials, bluesign-certified materials TripSavvy / Nathan Allen

Weather resistance

Two-way zipper What We Don't Like No waist cinch One of the company's best-loved down jackets, Patagonia's DAS Light hooded jacket is with an ultralight nylon ripstop and is infused with a durable water-repellent finish to keep rain and snow from sinking in. It's also made with 65 grams of recycled polyester PlumaFill. It has a zip under its monochromatic snap closures, too, and the two do the double duty of protecting wearers against snow, wind, and rain. There's even an internal pocket for your smartphone, and the hood can be folded into the collar when you don't need it. Sizes for men and women range from extra small to extra large. The DAS Light Hoody did what the Micro Puff could not—keep me warm while still offering superior packability. Once I got this jacket, the Micro Puff never left the closet. Side-by-side, the DAS Light Hoody is a more substantial jacket. It's thicker and also packs down a bit larger, but not to the point of prohibiting me from using it when space is limited. The extra space it took up was well worth the extra warmth it provided. I was pleasantly surprised by its wet weather resistance. I had it out in light snowstorms in Mammoth, and light precipitation didn't penetrate its shell.

Great mobility

Lots of pockets for organization What We Don't Like Insulated rather than a shell, making it a bit tougher to dial layering The 9 Best Lightweight Jackets of 2023 A lot about Patagonia's Insulated Powder Town jacket impressed us during testing. It's breathable, warm, and lightweight. Besides taking this on the slopes, we took it running when temperatures dipped into the low 20s and found the breathability and stretch made it an excellent outerlayer, giving us full range of motion without overheating. That mobility is amped from a 100 percent post-consumer recycled polyester two-layer shell with 80 grams of Thermogreen insulation in the body and 40 grams in the sleeves. Patagonia's proprietary PFC-free H2No DWR tops off the jacket, making it fully waterproof. (We also took this out in a proper rainstorm and found it held up well.) Patagonia's thoughtful features and construction also impressed us, particularly all the pockets that help boost organization. Pockets include two zippered hand-warming pockets, a zippered chest pocket, a pass pocket on the forearm, an internal stash pocket for money, and an internal drop-in pocket for goggles or gloves.

Limited color options If there is ever one winter coat everyone should own, it's a down jacket—also commonly referred to as a puffy. Patagonia's Down Sweater Hooded Jacket is the quintessential puffy. The 20 x 30-denier 100 percent recycled polyester ripstop shell is DWR coated and windproof, and 800-fill goose down is stuffed inside the shell to keep you cozy and warm. An adjustable hem and elastic cuffs add to the jacket's warmth by keeping the heat inside and those pesky drafts out. For easy packing, the jacket stuffs into its chest pocket down to a little smaller than a football. This jacket does everything it should and nothing it shouldn't. It's not fancy; it just works. I'm a finicky person in terms of heat management. If I'm moving, I heat up fast, but once I stop, I get cold just as fast. I found this jacket good to about 30(ish) degrees F standing around. Once the temps dipped below that, I would always default to a beefier puffy like the Fitz Roy or Grade VII Parka. Its upper-temperature range is impressive. In central California, where I live, the nights often dip into the upper 50's. With a T-shirt underneath, this is a perfect jacket for these temperatures. As I've mentioned with other Patagonia jackets, this one fits large, so a size smaller than what I normally wear did the trick. If a down jacket is too large it loses some of its warmth.

Pit zips and helmet-compatible hood What We Don't Like Nothing yet There's a ton to love about one of Patagonia's newest rain jackets. During our rain jacket testing, we found it to be one of the most waterproof and breathable of the 15 or so we tested. Patagonia uses a proprietary H2No shell fabric, which is at the top of the market for blocking moisture from coming in and releasing it simultaneously. It also features watertight zippers, pit zips, and an adjustable drawcord at the bottom to cinch down. We like intelligent features like a helmet-compatible hood with a ton of coverage and the ability to pack it into its own pocket. This has been a go-to rain shell for us for about a year now and came in particularly handy during California's deluge of atmospheric rivers in early 2023.

Best Wind Shell Patagonia Houdini Full-Zip Jacket Backcountry View On Backcountry.com View On REI What We Like Small packed size

Excellent wind protection

Durable shell material What We Don't Like Virtually no breathability The Patagonia Houdini was one of the first super lightweight wind shells, and to this day, it’s still one the best. Weighing in at a measly 3.7 ounces and packing down to roughly the size of a baseball, it’s pocket-sized weather protection. The shell is made with a durable featherweight 100 percent recycled nylon ripstop with an adjustable hood. There is one chest pocket that doubles as a stuff sack for stowing. No matter where I’m climbing, odds are you’ll find the Houdini in my pack. I’ll use it as an emergency weather shell or an extra layer when it gets chilly. Due to how light and small it packs down, it’s a no-brainer to throw in the pack. Patagonia pins it as a running shell; however, the breathability is extremely poor. It’s not a jacket I wanted to spend any significant time moving fast in. I’ve tried running with it on, and I always come away drenched with sweat inside. Personally, a better application is for a moderate activity where I don’t heat up, like hiking, or as an oh-shit last resort shell layer when running in high, windy alpine terrain. It’s worth noting two things—for how thin it is, I found it durable as hell, and it also fits true to size.

https://www.gearpatrol.com/outdoors/a43241598/gore-tex-patagonia-expanded-polyethylene/,How Patagonia and Gore-Tex Are Making Waterproof-Breathable Earth-Friendly Too,"Gore-Tex is not your average, run-of-the-mill outdoor brand. It’s a multi-national manufacturing behemoth that doesn’t just supply the world of rugged outwear with durably waterproof fabric; it’s also got its hands in the medical, industrial and military spheres as well. In fact, if you’ve gotten a hernia repaired in the last decade, you could be reading this with a patch of Gore-Tex inside you right now.

But in the outdoors, as far as anyone can remember, Gore-Tex has been synonymous with waterproof-breathable outdoor apparel. Don’t want your ski pants wetting out? Go with Gore-Tex. Need to stay dry during an overnight hunt? Gore-Tex is your go-to. Brands have tried to escape its shadow (remember FutureLight, anyone?) but practically speaking, Gore-Tex is everywhere.

That ubiquitousness comes with a cost, in the form of PFAs and fluorinated chemicals. Recent research has shown that fluorinated chemicals have an adverse effect on both our personal health and the environment around us, but no one's really pushed back.

Even (some) professional athletes would rather have extremely efficacious Gore-Tex in its original formula, even if it comes with a little toxicity. Performance is the only real benchmark, right?

A game-changing Hail Mary

Wrong, says Patagonia. The environment-conscious brand, whose biggest shareholder is Mother Earth, set an internal goal to be completely free of PFCS and any other fluorinated materials by 2022. During a meeting with Gore-Tex at Outdoor Retailer in 2018, their team made that very clear: the brand intended to stop using any materials with PFCs, and if Gore-Tex didn't have anything available by then, it was goodbye.

""Patagonia was very clear that their goals were to be PFC-free in their product line by the year 2022,"" says Matt Decker, Global Technical and Innovation Leader for consumer fabrics, W.L. Gore & Associates. ""And we didn't have anything at the time. They were getting ready to leave the meeting when one of our product managers said: 'Wait, there is one thing we're working on. You know, it's not really ready yet, but if you guys want to partner with us on this and see if we can make it ready, I guess we'd be willing to do that.' And that's where it all kicked off right there.""

That Hail Mary thrown out by Gore-Tex turned out to be ePe (expanded polyethylene): a new durable, waterproofing membrane that is just as efficacious at repelling water as Gore-Tex's original ePTFE formula — yes, that's short for Expanded Polytetrafluoroethylene — but without fluorocarbons.

Gore-Tex

Decker shared these details with me during a press event in Bozeman, Montana, where we got to test out the tech in some Patagonia outerwear while ice climbing and splitboarding. I'll need more time with it to make a full evaluation, but my initial impressions while laboring in the snow was, I wouldn't have known they'd swapped the material if you hadn't told me — which seems like a promising first impression.

It's pretty exciting when you think about it: following years of research and development, the leading manufacturer of waterproof fabrics found a way to remove the most toxic element from its recipe, protecting customers and the environment from exposure.

It turns out, ePe already existed before Gore-Tex decided to use it to replace PTFE. What the company managed to do was expand (hence the ""little e"" in ePe) polyethylene in a similar way that it did its hallmark product, making it more useful, thinner, and just as effective as PTFE — but without the harmful forever chemicals. Because the membrane is thinner and requires less material to produce, it's also more carbon friendly than its predecessor.

An ePe membrane gets its close-up. Gore-Tex

Teamwork bears (Earth-friendly) fruit

After agreeing to take a chance on this new, mostly-unproved membrane, Patagonia gave Gore-Tex access to its wear-testing infrastructure, speeding up the testing process for ePe by years. Pasha Whitmire, who was on staff with Patagonia at the time of the partnership but has since become Material Development Leader at Gore-Tex, sees the upsides from both sides.

""When the Gore team put this product on the table, we were completely blown away,"" he recalls. ""It was exactly what we were looking for. Gore-Tex was really coming to the table with a lot of great scientific, very thorough data around ePe meeting its durability requirements, meeting its water repellency and waterproofness requirements. And so we felt confident from that perspective, but we also wanted to really validate the product in real world applications.""

After years of development and refinement, Patagonia and Gore-Tex successfully brought ePe to market right on schedule, Fall 2022. But if you didn't hear about the release, that isn't surprising. Gore-Tex did a limited launch of ePe with Patagonia and a few other brands, including Adidas Terrex, Arc'Teryx, Dakine and Salomon; it plans to bring ePe to the broader outdoor market by 2025.



When I asked why, if ePe is as efficacious as ePTFE and less toxic, wouldn't Gore-Tex replace all of its materials with ePe, Gore-Tex representatives told me it was a scaling issue. New supply chains have to be created, products from various brands have to be tested to make sure they live up to Gore's durably waterproof standards, and all of this takes time.

But it's coming soon. In Bozeman, the Gore-Tex reps said a major rollout is coming Fall 2024, and all consumer fabrics will be made with ePe by 2025.

https://www.glossy.co/fashion/the-arrivals-wants-to-claim-the-gap-between-patagonia-and-moncler/,The Arrivals wants to claim the gap between Patagonia and Moncler,"Direct-to-consumer outerwear brand The Arrivals spent most of its first nine years in existence as a New York-based outerwear brand known for its leather jackets. But in 2019, co-founder and chief brand officer Jeff Johnson relocated to San Francisco while the brand’s operations remained based in New York. The brand’s bicoastal setup over the last three years has led to a reinvention of the its ethos and aesthetic.

“After the move, the entire brand incrementally started to embrace the technical side [of apparel],” Johnson said. “We’ve moved away from chasing trends or fashion and more toward these performance pieces like puffers that are meant to compete with, say, a Patagonia. And those technical pieces have been our best-performing products category in the last year.”

That ethos can be seen in the brand’s latest collection, which is its first rainwear collection, released on March 1. Johnson said the team has introduced new materials, including a three-layer bonded membrane, to ensure the product performs as well as the competition. It’s also linked with new factories. For its technical and performance gear, The Arrivals uses a factory in China, where Johnson said the most technically advanced manufacturers are. It works with a factory in Los Angeles for its cut-and-sew fashion pieces.

Johnson wants to position The Arrivals between the two extremes of outerwear. On the one side are brands like Patagonia and Arc’teryx with lots of credibility among hardcore hikers and outdoors enthusiasts but less with the urban high fashion set. Johnson jokingly called these companies “granola brands.” On the other side is luxury brands like Moncler, which Johnson said have the opposite audience: lots of love from the high-fashion crowd, less so from actual mountaineers. Between them is a white space that he hopes The Arrivals can fill.

For now, 70% of The Arrivals’ audience resides in New York, the majority of which are women. But the second largest cohort is a growing community of The Arrivals lovers on the West Coast, which are mostly men. Johnson said the gender aspect wasn’t intentional, just an interesting quirk of the different communities. But the larger West Coast consumer base was a purposeful choice.

To grow this performance-focused outdoor enthusiast base, Johnson said the brand has done a combination of IRL events, like hosting community hikes on both coasts, and working with content creators with outdoor credibility. The Arrivals sent products to @gorpcoretex, an anonymous but influential Instagrammer with more than 50,000 followers, and Advanced Rock, the pseudonym of photographer Liam Furneaux. Both regularly showcase high-quality outdoor gear, and both posted favorably about The Arrivals, from a performance perspective, on their Instagram.

“These people are validators in the space,” Johnson said. “They have experience with brands like Arc’teryx and Patagonia, and they have such a discerning eye for serious outdoor gear. It’s really validating for us to be embraced by them.”

The Arrivals has also begun shifting its advertising and creative content. For example, it’s doing more photo shoots on the West Coast, specifically in the Pacific Northwest, to show the product out in the field rather than on city streets. An upcoming campaign was shot in Portland in mid-February.

But moving into this performance space won’t be easy, according to Hanna Lane, senior account director of fashion at marketing firm Power Digital. Lane said outdoor enthusiasts tend to be loyal to the brands they’ve been using. And while The Arrivals can and has made headway into the new consumer segment, it won’t be easy to unseat big brands like Patagonia.

“The Arrivals has the potential to compete with established performance brands by showcasing the unique, objectively measurable performance features of their product,” Lane said.

The Arrivals has been primarily DTC since it launched, selling a small percentage at wholesale through select retailers like Bergdorf Goodman. Johnson said he wants to keep wholesale small and continue to focus on DTC. The brand slightly raised its prices last year, and Johnson said he hopes to keep current prices throughout this year.

“We’re still curious about inflation,” Johnson said. “Right now, our costs have gone up a little bit, just because the manufacturers are cautious and are charging more beyond the true cost of materials and labor. But we’re still waiting to see if this is going to be more of an issue for us.”",['Danny Parisi'],2023-03-06 05:10:00+00:00

Anyone who has shopped at a retailer with few physical storefronts knows it can be hard to figure out where to begin. There are lots of options that all seem as worthy as the next, but the reality is that products from any given brand are not all created equal. When you shop as regularly as we do, you learn that many brands just do some things better than they do other things. With an expansive inventory of hard-wearing, adventure-minded gear, Patagonia is one of those brands. Founded by Yvon Chouinard, who recently donated the company and all future profits to fight climate change, the company’s sustainable efforts extend to its apparel and accessories. To help you find the best jackets, fleece pullovers, windbreakers, base layers, travel bags, and more, we’ve compiled all the products that our writers and editors — plus designers, CEOs, chefs, and, of course, Chris Black — have recommended.

Bags

For something more compact to house your toiletries, Builder uses the three-liter packing cube for her makeup and the six-liter for bulkier travel items like shower essentials, face wipes, and her toothbrush. She says the six-liter packing-cube design is ideal because, like the ten-liter option above, it can be unzipped to lay flat and completely open.

Shorts

Patagonia Women’s Baggies Shorts $59 Baggies are also available in a women’s cut, which Builder and Strategist senior editor Winnie Yang both mention for being all-around shorts that can be worn for lounging, walking the beach, and running errands. Builder prefers the shorter Baggies and sizes up “so they aren’t too short,” while Yang says she prefers the five-inch inseam for a more modest fit. $59 at REI Buy $59 at Patagonia Buy

Outerwear

Camilla Cho, SVP of e-commerce at Vox Media, owns two of these Houdini Jackets, which have been with her through many runs and races and are still in great shape. “The thing is so light you forget you have it on,” Cho says. “It’s perfect for exercising outdoors when it’s a bit breezy and great for traveling, since you can stuff the whole thing into the side pocket so it becomes a little pouch that you can throw into a bag.” David Bruno, a cyclist and owner of Départ Wine in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, even keeps this shell with him at all times in case the weather changes unexpectedly.

When we talked to cool people — like professional skiers, shop owners, and ski patrollers — about the best ski-jacket options, the Patagonia Triolet Shell earned the top overall spot. Jackie Kearney, a ski patroller at Lake Tahoe’s Kirkwood Resort, says many of her colleagues wear it because “it’s sturdy and waterproof” and because of technical features like “more pockets and pit zips, which are nice to get some more ventilation.” And when celebrity stylist Mac Huelster temporarily moved to the West Coast, he replaced his snow jacket with the lighter Triolet, which he says is ideal for layering.

Patagonia Women’s Nano Puff Parka $279 $279 Strategist writer Arielle Avila thrifted this Nano Puff Parka before moving to New York City last year, and says its insulation was effective during her first winter. “It’s incredibly warm, so I’d wear it by itself, but it’s super-lightweight, so I was able to layer it underneath my less substantial jackets,” she says. And if she gets too warm, Avila says she can easily pack it into a tote for storage. “I can’t stress how nice it is to have a puffer that doesn’t take up lots of closet space,” she says. $279 at REI Buy $299 at Patagonia Buy

Fleeces

Patagonia Classic Retro-X Jacket $229 $229 Builder also has this fleece in beige with a Kelly-green pocket and trim that she got in 2009 at the Patagonia outlet in Freeport, Maine. “It’s the perfect autumn coat for when you’re hot in the sun, but it’s still a brisk 50 degrees outside,” she says. Plus, even after years of wear, “the actual stitching has stayed intact, and the zippers work great,” Builder says. $229 at REI Buy $229 at Patagonia Buy

Base layers

In our roundup of the best long underwear for women, the Capilene thermals were named our best synthetic option, and are suitable for a range of outdoor winter activities. The flatlock seams offer chafe-free comfort, and there’s enough stretch to the fabric for high-intensity movements. When she’s not wearing the merino leggings she designs for Ply-Knits, Carolyn Yim swears by the Capilene base-layer bottoms. She also appreciates the brand’s commitment to responsible sourcing and points out that these thermals are made from 92 percent recycled PET bottles — plus, they can be donated to Patagonia’s Common Threads program, which will recycle them into a new garment. Primary Essentials owner Lauren Snyder also approves: “I like Patagonia thermals because they really do work, and they last. I still have pairs that I’ve had for years.”

Builder says these Capilene tees are her go-tos for most outdoor activities. “The long-sleeve is great for sailing and kayaking, because it’s not too heavy and also protects from the sun,” she says. “And then [the short-sleeve] is just a great sweat-wicking shirt for hikes.” Capilene is known for its anti-odor technology, which keeps you feeling cooler and fresher for longer.

Workwear

Yang is a fan of Patagonia’s Hemp Canvas workwear line. She owns a pair of the Bib Overalls, which have buttons on each side of the hip for easy on-and-off, as well as buttons on each shoulder strap for adjusting the length of the torso. Yang also has the insulated and heavy-duty Barn Coat, which she’s owned since 2018. According to the brand, this topper is more durable than conventional cotton duck canvas and is built for cold weather.

For kids

To bundle up your little ones, Patagonia offers a wide range of options for small humans. Yang has tried a number of other brands — including North Face, Columbia, Spyder, Polarn O. Pyret, Hanna Andersson, and Target’s in-house label Cat & Jack — but says Patagonia’s kids’ outerwear is noticeably well-made and long-lasting. “We’ve been the recipient of plenty of hand-me-downs, and the Patagonia stuff always looks like it’s brand-new, while some other stuff might fade or look more worn over time,” Yang says. She uses the Hi-Loft Down line on colder days (freezing and below) and when it’s snowing. “It’s not waterproof, but our son played in the snow in the bunting, and it kept him dry and toasty,” Yang says. The Tribbles Hoodie is reversible, but Yang prefers to keep the fleece-lined side on the inside for added warmth. If you’re concerned about the price, Yang says Patagonia also has good resale value, and she likes that you can send or take in any used Patagonia for credit toward new items.

https://grist.org/accountability/patagonia-turns-over-company-fight-climate-change/,Two ways to think about Patagonia’s $3 billion climate donation,"When Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard announced last week that he and family members were giving away the company to use its profits to fight climate change, the move was hailed as historic and remarkable by philanthropic experts.

The outdoor retailer, with a history of sustainability and environmental efforts, once told people to “think twice” before buying one of its iconic jackets. Now, in the wake of their decision to give away the company, some observers are in fact thinking twice — about whether the giveaway is actually that groundbreaking.

According to some legal experts, it’s a typical tax move.

Chouinard, his wife, and their two adult children transferred all of the company’s voting stock, or 2 percent of all shares, to the newly created Patagonia Purpose Trust, as first reported by the New York Times. The rest of the company’s stock has been transferred to a newly created social welfare organization, the Holdfast Collective, which will inject a projected $100 million a year into environmental nonprofits and political organizations. Patagonia Purpose Trust will oversee this mission and company operations. The giveaway was valued at roughly $3 billion and did not merit a charitable deduction, with the family paying $17.5 million in taxes on the donation to the trust.

While this move is groundbreaking in the philanthropic world, New York University law professor Daniel Hemel told Quartz that the giveaway allowed the family to reap the benefits of a commonly used tax law maneuver used by philanthropists. The Chouinard family paid more than $17 million in taxes when all was said and done, however, Hemel noted that the payment is a small percentage of the donation made, and the way the trusts and ruling organizations played out still allowed the family to call the shots on both the business and its future charitable contributions.

The Chouinard family’s gift has been compared to a recent move by conservative billionaire Barre Seid, who sold his entire company to the tune of $1.6 billion to fund right-wing political actions. When the New York Times reported on Seid, his transaction was noted to be shaded in dark money, while Patagonia’s was historic, despite both billionaires funneling money into 501c4 organizations. Hemel called out this juxtaposition both on Twitter and in his recent interview, where he said the gifts were “substantively similar.”

Billionaires use charitable giving to address a variety of issues, from right-wing politics to preserving wildlife. Communication and public policy professor Matthew Nisbet of Northeastern University has been outspoken against the role philanthropy and billionaires play in climate change before and told Grist that the newly announced Patagonia decision may be applauded by many in environmental industries, but Yvon Chouinard has essentially gone from a reluctant billionaire to political fat cat.

“Now that they’ve invented this (model) and introduced it to the marketplace for politically motivated billionaires, regardless of their background, everyone’s going to do it,“ Nisbet said. “This is an escalating zero-sum political arms race.” With the creation of the new 501c4 Holdfast Collective, Nisbet likened this new organization to other notable political spending groups, such as the National Rifle Association and the conservative Club for Growth.

A 501c4 organization, considered a tax-exempt, social welfare organization by the Internal Revenue Service, is not required to disclose its donors but must disclose money granted to other organizations equal to $5,000 or more. 501c4 organizations can engage in political lobbying and endorse candidates related to their organizational mission.*

Nisbet feared that the influx of cash controlled by an interest group would set the agenda of climate issues in the political realm moving forward. “Do you believe that our politics should be decided by billionaires who can spend hundreds of millions of dollars in elections with no accountability, no transparency, and pick and choose winners or pick and choose issues?” he asked.

Lack of transparency in political spending and philanthropy has mired public perception of charitable giving, causing long-standing scrutiny that dates back to 20th-century oil baron John D. Rockefeller’s creation of his namesake foundation. 501c4 organizations have funded anti-climate Facebook ads and directly influence climate legislation at the state level, with little knowledge of who funds these actions. While the source of the Holdfast Collective’s funding will come directly from Patagonia’s profits, Nisbet said he worries the new organization could become a way for other billionaires to donate and influence climate issues. Modern-day billionaires have taken climate change, the environment, and agriculture under their charitable wings more often in recent years, despite 10 percent of the world’s richest people producing half of the globe’s carbon emissions.

Soon-to-be trillionaire Jeff Bezos created a $10 billion Bezos Earth Fund in 2020, but Amazon has come under fire from watchdogs for undercounting its carbon footprint, punishing climate-focused workers, and polluting neighboring communities. Bill Gates has focused his philanthropy on agriculture and global hunger, while critics accuse him of gobbling up American farmland and cornering the market on seeds. Both Bezos and Gates have poured billions into tech-focused climate solutions, as well as Tesla founder Elon Musk also offering up $100 million for carbon capture innovations.

Patagonia has increased its political presence in recent years when it went to the courtroom to fight for the conservation of the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah and joined legal battles against logging, as well as commented on voting rights. The outdoor retail giant does have a long history of charitable giving, as they’ve donated 1 percent of all profits to environmental causes for decades and donated back $10 million of tax cuts to climate advocates.

Patagonia spokesperson Corley Kenna told Grist that, at this time, there are no publicly announced organizations that the company’s future funds will go to, but “all options are on the table.” She said Chouinard and the Holdfast Collective are interested in tackling the root causes of the climate crisis, including land and water protection, grantmaking to on-the-ground groups, and funding policy focused on solutions.

The spokesperson strongly rebuked the criticism that the recently announced company transition is not rooted in transparency and will fuel untraceable funds, citing Patagonia’s long history of transparency about its manufacturing, giving, and leadership.

“Yvon Chouinard, the Chouinard family, and the Holdfast Collective is not an extension of a political party,” Kenna said. “What we’re talking about here is a family that is committed to addressing the existential crises facing our planet.”

With big-name companies and wealthy families entering the fray, climate-focused philanthropy has grown in recent years, but still accounts for less than 2 percent of global giving, according to a report last year by ClimateWorks Foundation. Shawn Reifsteck, vice president of strategy and communications for the foundation, said Patagonia is “trailblazing a new way for companies to give back for generations to come” and he hopes others will follow suit. Philanthropic strategist Bruce DeBoskey said more and more philanthropists are recognizing that the traditional model of writing checks and giving grants has not been successful in solving overarching societal problems and billionaires are adopting new models of giving, such as the Chouinard family’s giveaway.

“It’s not about changes in the tax laws that I’m aware of,” DeBoskey said. “It’s about the changes in thinking.”

Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard announced Wednesday that he is giving away the outdoor-apparel company — an unorthodox move intended to help combat climate change and the environmental crisis. In a letter posted to the company’s website, Chouinard wrote that ownership of the company, which was founded in 1973 and reportedly valued at about $3 billion, has been transferred to a trust that was created to protect the company’s values and mission as well as a nonprofit organization.

“Earth is now our only shareholder,” it said. “100% of the company’s voting stock transfers to the Patagonia Purpose Trust, created to protect the company’s values; and 100% of the nonvoting stock had been given to the Holdfast Collective, a nonprofit dedicated to fighting the environmental crisis and defending nature.”

In addition, profits that aren’t reinvested back into the business will be distributed by Patagonia as a dividend to the Holdfast Collective to help address climate change, according to a news release. The company projects that it will pay out an annual dividend of about $100 million — an amount that could change depending on the health of the business.

Yvon Chouinard spoke about preserving public lands in a Patagonia advertisement released on Aug. 20, 2017. (Video: Patagonia/YouTube)

“It’s been a half-century since we began our experiment in responsible business,” Chouinard, 83, said in the release. “If we have any hope of a thriving planet 50 years from now, it demands all of us doing all we can with the resources we have. As the business leader I never wanted to be, I am doing my part. Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth, we are using the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source.”

“I am dead serious about saving this planet,” he added.

The decision, which was first reported by the New York Times, reflects Chouinard’s maverick approach to tying his business to conservation and political activism over his roughly five-decade career. The company lambasted President Donald Trump and members of his administration for scaling back public land protections, and even sued Trump over his move to cut Utah’s Bears Ears National Monument by 85 percent.

Several of Chouinard’s allies said that his move reflected his long-standing approach to environmentalism.

“It’s kind of crazy to say it doesn’t surprise me,” said Josh Ewing, who worked with Patagonia to expand Bears Ears’ boundaries while heading the nonprofit Friends of Cedar Mesa.

“I’ve had the opportunity to appreciate the just unique and unprecedented leadership that the Chouinards, as well as staff at Patagonia, have put into conservation and climate leadership,” said Ewing, who now directs the Rural Climate Partnership.

In 2021, Patagonia announced it would no longer sell its merchandise at a popular Wyoming ski resort after one of the owners hosted a fundraiser featuring Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.) and other Republicans who support Trump.

The company has also pursued more traditional forms of activism. Beyond making products with materials that cause less harm to the environment, for years Patagonia has donated 1 percent of its sales largely to grass-roots environmental nonprofits, and will continue to do so.

Patagonia funded a 2014 documentary film called “DamNation,” which aimed to mobilize support for demolishing dams in order to revive wild fish populations.

Chouinard has also supported groups that work directly on elections, such as the League of Conservation Voters. LCV President Gene Karpinski said the retail magnate backed the group’s efforts to register and turn out young voters and voters of color.

Chouinard has “been a model for building a sustainable business and now he’s a model for doing sustainable giving,” Karpinski said. “From the beginning, his company had a vision for being best in class as a sustainable company, and now he’s ensuring that will be the path going forward.”

In Wednesday’s letter, Chouinard explained that selling Patagonia or going public were both flawed options. While the company could have been sold and all the profits donated, there wasn’t a guarantee that a new owner would maintain the business’s values or ensure that all of its workers stayed employed. And taking the company public, Chouinard wrote, would have been a “disaster.”

“Even public companies with good intentions are under too much pressure to create short-term gain at the expense of long-term vitality and responsibility,” he wrote.

Choosing to give away Patagonia is the latest step in the company’s lengthy experiment in responsible business, Chouinard wrote.

“If we have any hope of a thriving planet — much less a thriving business — 50 years from now, it is going to take all of us doing what we can with the resources we have,” he wrote. “This is another way we’ve found to do our part.”

Ryan Gellert, Patagonia’s CEO, said in a statement that the Chouinard family “challenged” him and a few others two years ago to develop a new structure for the company with two central goals: “They wanted us to both protect the purpose of the business and immediately and perpetually release more funding to fight the environmental crisis,” he said. “We believe this new structure delivers on both and we hope it will inspire a new way of doing business that puts people and planet first.”

Under the new arrangement, the Chouinard family will guide the Patagonia Purpose Trust and the philanthropic work carried out by the Holdfast Collective, according to the news release. The company’s leadership also will not change. Gellert will continue to serve as the company’s CEO while the Chouinard family remains on Patagonia’s board.

To mark the occasion, Patagonia tweeted, “We’re closed today to celebrate this new plan to save our one and only home. We’ll be back online tomorrow.” On Wednesday night, staff attended a “party for the planet” at the company’s campus in Ventura, Calif., a spokesperson said.

Members of Patagonia’s board praised the transfer of ownership.

“Companies that create the next model of capitalism through deep commitment to purpose will attract more investment, better employees, and deeper customer loyalty,” Charles Conn, chair of the board, said in a statement. “They are the future of business if we want to build a better world, and that future starts with what Yvon is doing now.”

Some retail industry experts said the move could reverberate beyond a single company.

Chouinard has “just set a new bar for retailers,” Paula Rosenblum, managing partner of at the retail consulting firm RSR, wrote in an email. “No greenwashing here. He put his money where his mouth was.”

https://www.modernretail.co/operations/how-patagonia-provisions-is-building-out-its-product-portfolio-with-its-first-ever-acquisition/,How Patagonia Provisions is building out its product portfolio with its first-ever acquisition,"This week, Patagonia’s food and beverage division announced the acquisition of cracker brand Moonshot. This acquisition is Patagonia’s first in two decades, and helps expand Patagonia Provisions’ growing CPG line – which includes tinned fish and seafood.

In an interview with Modern Retail, Paul Lightfood, Patagonia Provisions’ general manager described the acquisition as a way to further Patagonia’s efforts to work with farmers to produce food sustainably. “You could get to zero emissions when making apparel, but it’s a lot of hard work,” Lightfood said. “But food could be better than zero, because its production can be regenerative with the right farming practices.”

Patagonia’s provisions division was created in 2012, and began selling its first product, wild salmon jerky, at retailers in 2013. The overarching thesis behind Patagonia Provisions, according to Lightfood, is the idea that, “if we’re going to save our planet, food could be and should be the most important lever that we can pull toward that mission.” Today, its assortment has expanded to include over 30 SKUs, ranging from $6 seasoning blends, to $8 canned mussels, to $10 smoked venison links.

This sustainable approach also informs which organizations Patagonia Provisions partners with. The division is currently working with growers of Kernza, a trademarked grain that’s harvested from intermediate wheatgrass, that’s being used in Patagonia Provisions’ pantry staples like pastas, and soon, beer.

Moonshot itself was created by a software company called Planet Forward as an in-house project. The cracker line launched in 2020 and is now sold at grocers nationwide, having expanded to Target last summer. The company touts itself as a climate-friendly snack brand, and uses regenerative and organic practices to farm and mill wheat. The deal came from Moonshot’s business values naturally aligning with Patagonia’s. That said, Lightfood said Patagonia Provisions won’t be going on an acquisition spree anytime soon.

In this interview, Lightfood discussed what the better-for-you category means to Patagonia, and how the new acquisition will help gain market share in the cracker aisle. This interview was edited for clarity and length.

Patagonia Provisions has been around for about a decade. What types of initiatives and products have you focused on since 2012?

For the first several years in the marketplace, we created some truly innovative products within a climate-friendly supply chain. We think that access to good food is important. However, the environmental impacts aren’t reflected in the cost of most of the standard American diet, which is a shame. But we’d rather sell more expensive products than to operate in a way that wasn’t consistent with our values.

That said, our products are somewhat premium, but not super premium. That’s how our apparel is too. Making things responsibly often costs more. Hopefully, in the case of apparel, you’ll have a jacket for seven years and it’s a good value. And with nutrition and health, we think people should pay a fair price both for the planet’s health and their own health. With better-for-you, I like to lump it alongside it being better for the planet. Now it’s about scaling the Patagonia Provisions business in a way that’s commercially successful.

You’ve expanded the product portfolio in the past few years to include pantry and snack items. How has the assortment evolved?

Seafood was and is the biggest part of our business. Now we’re selling mackerel, mussels and anchovies from Spain. Those fish are being harvested by our standards, and not causing harm to oceans. That’s really important to the company because we’ve always cared a lot about fisheries and ocean ecosystems. So we’re trying to create alternative conditions for nutritious seafood. That remains our most important and successful venture.

We’re also a pasta company now. We have one item that’s a Kernza grain fusilli, and that’s expanding to six more next year. We’re now also in the testing phase of making beer from Kernza – that will go live this summer, and it could be a blockbuster. And with Moonshot, we’re now getting into crackers that help convert farmland wheat to be regenerative.

Moonshot is the first-ever Patagonia Provisions acquisition. How did the deal come about?

We had actually just become a Planet Forward customer, and we were talking about using their software for our ingredients and products. They were talking about this business they had internally, which was Moonshot.

It’s run by a terrific group of women, who’ve created this amazing business. They have a really awesome ecosystem of suppliers around the Skagit Valley in Washington. The two farms and the mill are doing a great job with renewable energy, and are integrating co-packers as well. They’re taking market share away from mainstream cracker brands at a rapid pace, and we were just blown away by how successful it was. So that got us excited about it.

With this new product line, what’s your strategy for retail distribution?

The Moonshot team has done an amazing job in growing the brand. But our two most important customers are Whole Foods and Target, who have been amazingly supportive and continue to be so. Chasing doors is not going to be the highest priority. We’d rather be deeper and narrower with partnerships. Will continue with those two partnerships, and you’ll probably see us at other retailers who really care about the brand and brand blocks and will give it the support it needs to be nurtured and thrive.

As for growing the portfolio, I doubt you’ll see more deals from us this year. Moonshot has been a bit of a unicorn, and couldn’t help being excited and jumped at the opportunity. But for the most part, our role is pretty clear, which is to create market opportunities that motivate farms to invest in practicing and converting to regenerative production.",['Gabriela Barkho'],2023-03-09 05:00:53+00:00
https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-02-20/the-race-to-waterproof-outdoor-gear-without-toxic-chemicals,The race to waterproof outdoor gear — without toxic chemicals,"Patagonia Inc. has spent nearly 10 years working to remove toxic chemicals from its outdoor apparel, such as these jackets displayed at a 2019 trade show. Many other manufacturers are just beginning to tackle the problem as bans on “forever chemicals” loom.

Patagonia Inc. has spent nearly a decade rejiggering its supply chain, redesigning products and dumping millions of dollars into a high-stakes trial-and-error process that’s nearly complete.

For the Ventura outdoor clothing retailer, this isn’t about optimizing for fashion.

Patagonia, like practically every other outdoor apparel company, has long relied on per- or polyfluorinated chemicals — PFAS for short — to make its products water-resistant.

The problem is that these chemicals, also known as fluorochemicals, PFC chemicals or forever chemicals, are toxic. They’ve been linked to cancer and other health problems and they don’t degrade easily: PFAS have been found in drinking water and in the human bloodstream.

Despite years of warnings from scientists and environmental activists, many apparel retailers only recently started sussing out how to ditch PFAS in outdoor apparel and gear. But the stragglers may not be able to straggle much longer: Bans on the chemicals are coming.

“We were looking for a magic chemistry that could do it all and get our performance back and keep your jacket waterproof,” said Matt Dwyer, Patagonia’s vice president of product impact and innovation. “And it took a whole lot more work than that.”

The PFAS problem has been decades in the making.

In the 1950s, Minnesota-based chemical maker 3M Co. launched Scotchgard, which used fluorochemicals to make fabrics water- and stain-repellant.

Within a few decades, the chemicals were ubiquitous in outdoor apparel and gear. That’s because “they just blew everything apart in terms of how well they worked,” said Richard Blackburn, a professor of sustainable materials at the University of Leeds.

These chemicals can repel water as well as, if not better than, any alternative, he said. If water is poured on a textile treated with PFAS, it just rolls or beads off. And unlike the alternatives, fluorochemicals also effectively repel oil, dirt and other stains.

“From a chemical perspective, they are fantastic,” Blackburn said.

But that resilience is also a liability.

Mike Schade, a campaign director with the environmental group Toxic-Free Future, notes that PFAS are harmful across their life cycle: The manufacturing phase can affect factory workers and local water systems, while washing and owning jackets and other products coated with PFAS can potentially harm consumers.

Indeed, 3M had known the chemicals were found in the blood of the general population and detected at elevated levels in its own workers by the mid-1970s. But exactly what 3M knew about the dangers of PFAS wasn’t publicly revealed until decades later following investigations and litigation.

“One of the reasons we’re concerned about PFAS is because they’re incredibly persistent chemicals,” Schade said. “They’re manufactured for food packaging or firefighting foam or rain jackets, and the chemicals don’t go away when they’re released into the environment. They can persist literally for hundreds of years.”

A key turning point, according to Blackburn, was Greenpeace’s Detox campaign in the mid-2010s, which started publicly targeting some outdoor apparel companies about their use of fluorochemicals. The environmental group tested 40 items for forever chemicals and found them in all but four, exposing an industry-wide problem.

That campaign had an effect on apparel makers in Europe: Jack Wolfskin announced its clothing, packs and bags were “100% PFC-free” by mid-2019; Vaude Sport announced its clothes and gear were PFC-free by 2020; and Haglofs is now “95% PFC free.” But in the U.S., and the rest of the world, an abundance of rain gear and outdoor equipment with PFAS is still in circulation.

Business Patagonia shows corporate activism is simpler than it looks From climate change to voting rights, Patagonia has been willing to risk backlash by taking positions on contentious social issues. It’s a risk that has paid off.

Patagonia initially transitioned away from what’s called “long-chain” PFAS chemicals, including PFOA and PFOS, to “short-chain” ones — completing the swap for products in stores by mid-2016. At the time, the thinking was that short-chain chemicals were safer; testing and scientific study into long-chain chemicals was more extensive.

But as the transition was underway, Dwyer said the company realized this was not “just an imperfect solution, but was a solution possibly as bad as the ones that we’d replaced.” So the journey to go totally PFAS-free began, and quickly proved daunting.

The first fabrics the company tested with PFC-free chemistries in 2015 “were stiff as paper and you could rip them in half,” Dwyer said. After hundreds of sample trials testing out dozens of different chemistries, Patagonia is today using about eight different PFAS alternatives for water-resistance on its various products sold worldwide.

The company is aiming for all products on its shelves to be “PFC-free” by the end of 2024 and announced last fall that 78% of its materials was already there.

A few other companies are also making progress, but a survey of 15 apparel and outdoor apparel brands on their PFAS use yielded a wide spectrum of results.

Business Meet overlanding, the love child of off-roading and #vanlife Eager to escape claustrophobic pandemic life and take advantage of newly remote jobs, increasing numbers of Americans are taking to remote places in rugged vehicles that are also homes.

Outerwear company Rains publicly reports not using these chemicals today, either because they never did or already phased them out. (The company did not respond to Bloomberg’s questions.) Swedish company Fjällräven says it has moved away from PFAS in all of its products, though the last of the new versions won’t be available to consumers until later this year.

Eight companies have announced plans to transition away from PFAS in the coming years, including Canada Goose Holdings Inc. Columbia Sportswear Co., Cotopaxi, W.L. Gore & Associates, Patagonia, Lululemon Athletica Inc., L.L.Bean Inc. and VF Corp.

Lululemon aims to do so by the end of this year. Eddie Bauer Inc. said it plans to remove PFAS from all products by spring 2024.

Adidas AG, Arc’teryx Equipment Inc., Nike Inc. and Vuori Inc. have not shared specific phase-out targets publicly or in response to Bloomberg’s repeated questions.

When Greenpeace contacted Fjällräven in 2012 about finding forever chemicals in its products, the outdoor apparel company had, as far as its executives knew, already stopped using PFAS in those items.

“I said, show me your test results, and I went to the Greenpeace headquarters in Germany,” said Aiko Bode, operating sustainability director at Fjällräven. The activists were right. “S—, something must have happened,” Bode recalled.

His follow-up investigation first revealed that a supplier using fluorochemistry on another company’s products was cross-contaminating Fjällräven’s, prompting a reorganization of Fjällräven’s suppliers. Subsequent testing revealed that simply having Fjällräven products in stores near products from other companies that used the chemicals still resulted in low levels of contamination.

One of the biggest challenges for the brands ditching PFAS is coordination across large and often complex supply chains.

Cotopaxi, a Salt Lake City-based outdoor apparel brand, makes gear that includes bags, hats and jackets — but has stayed away from producing high-performance rain gear because of high PFAS chemical content. Still, an internal testing process identified three Cotopaxi products that contain traces of PFAS, which the company is hoping to phase out this year.

“What we’re worried about with this issue is that Western brands aren’t going to allow their suppliers the opportunity to help source new chemistry needed to meet [regulations],” said Annie Agle, Cotopaxi’s senior director of impact and sustainability. “That could make them go out of business.”

Despite its contamination struggles, Fjällräven did ultimately figure out how to eliminate forever chemicals from the manufacturing process. In 2015, it started making its waterproof Keb Eco-Shell jacket using a PFAS alternative; by the middle of this year, even the zippers will be fluorochemical-free.

And the company tapped another pre-existing alternative — a paraffin/beeswax mix — for its “cornerstone material,” G-1000, which is made of recycled polyester and organic cotton. The trade-off on that, Bode said, was settling for products that don’t repel water quite as well as those coated with forever chemicals.

“If you go through just what normal people do, going through a fog, going through a forest, walking the dog, it works very well,” he said. But if you are hiking through two hours of heavy rainfall, for example, “you will not be dry.”

That loss of function is behind some companies’ reluctance to move away from forever chemicals, said Blackburn, who also calls all the added functionality “overengineering.” Blackburn’s research backs this up: An online survey of nearly 1,000 outdoor enthusiasts, most of them from Britain, found that they essentially only cared about water repellency.

“If you only want water repellency, there are much more sustainable technologies that work and deliver technically,” Blackburn said. “If you also want combined oil repellency then no, you can’t achieve that yet with any alternative chemistry.”

Representatives of Adidas, Columbia Sportswear and North Face-owner VF Corp., all of which are partway through their transitions away from forever chemicals, likewise noted that finding PFAS alternatives in high-performance jackets and other products designed for extreme environments is the most challenging task.

W.L. Gore & Associates (maker of Gore-Tex, a waterproof fabric used widely across apparel and footwear that has historically been found to contain PFAS) said it’s currently working to scale the use of a PFAS alternative known as ePE, which has been in development for a decade. The company said it is on track to transition the “vast majority” of its consumer portfolio away from harmful chemicals by the end of 2025.

Time is of the essence: Faced with indisputable science and increasing pressure to address environmental harms, governments are starting to catch up with PFAS.

In the U.S., roughly a dozen states already have policies banning or strictly regulating these chemicals in various products, including firefighting foam, rugs and cosmetics, according to tracking by an alliance of health organizations called Safer States.

Travel & Experiences 14 useful gifts for hikers and outdoor enthusiasts These gifts are for those who love to hike, camp and trail run — or those who just want to picnic on a nice blanket or take a joy ride with their dog.

More restrictions are coming online or being discussed specifically for textiles.

In California, a law passed last year bans the manufacture, distribution and sale of some fluorochemical-containing textiles for everyday use starting in 2025.

A Maine law that took effect in January requires brands to disclose to state environmental officials whether PFAS is used in their products; the chemicals will be banned in the state entirely by 2030. Washington state will ban PFAS in many consumer products, including apparel, by 2025. New York will also implement a ban on most apparel containing these chemicals by 2025.

The federal government, meanwhile, has been accused of “foot-dragging” on establishing meaningful protections.

In 2020, the Environmental Protection Agency halted the use of long-chain PFAS in the manufacture, processing or importing of many consumer products pending agency review; more restrictions are anticipated in the future. In the European Union, six countries submitted a proposal last month that would restrict the manufacture and use of PFAS across several product categories.

There are also growing legal threats.

Recreational Equipment Inc., more commonly known as REI, was hit with a proposed class-action lawsuit in October alleging that it deceptively markets certain waterproof garments as “sustainable” despite the presence of harmful PFAS; the suit is still pending.

Menstrual underwear brand Thinx reached a $5-million settlement last year following a class-action lawsuit alleging that its products contain PFAS chemicals. Thinx denied the allegations.

Following litigation of its own, 3M said in December that it will stop manufacturing PFAS by 2025, citing “accelerating regulatory trends focused on reducing or eliminating the presence of PFAS in the environment and changing stakeholder expectations.”

As the urgency around eliminating PFAS gains steam, companies that have made little progress thus far are effectively already behind.

Fast-fashion retailers may be able to roll out new clothing lines in just a few months, but the rest of the apparel world takes one or more years to go from product design to store-ready. That means companies aiming to heed upcoming bans need to start addressing their supply chain as soon as possible.

“Our chemical crystal ball told us that these regulations and things like that were going to happen at some point,” said Dwyer at Patagonia, which is already working on its 2025 products. “Now we know they’re in the very near future.”",[],2023-02-20 00:00:00

Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard, who has previously expressed his reluctance at amassing wealth, is giving away his company.

The outdoor apparel company will now be in the hands of a trust and a nonprofit organization. All future profits will be donated to help fight climate change, the company announced Wednesday.

""It's been a half-century since we began our experiment in responsible business,"" Chouinard, 84, said. ""If we have any hope of a thriving planet 50 years from now, it demands all of us doing all we can with the resources we have. As the business leader I never wanted to be, I am doing my part.""

He added, ""Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth, we are using the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source. We're making Earth our only shareholder. I am dead serious about saving this planet.""

The Patagonia Purpose Trust will control all voting stock of the company (2%), while the Holdfast Collective, a climate change nonprofit, will own all nonvoting stock (98%).

Chouinard, who is currently a board member, said in a statement that while trying to fight climate change, he realized his company was contributing to it. So he had been thinking about what to do with the business.

One option was to sell it and donate the money, but Chouinard said he was concerned new owners might not hold the same values or keep the same employees. The other option was to become a publicly traded entity.

""What a disaster that would have been,"" he said. ""Even public companies with good intentions are under too much pressure to create short-term gain at the expense of long-term vitality and responsibility.""

The Pew Charitable Trusts

Chile is a preferred travel destination for people from around the world who enjoy nature. In fact, just last year, the World Travel Awards named Chile the World’s Leading Green Destination. Chilean Patagonia, in particular, is home to 75% of the country’s protected areas, making it as valuable environmentally as it is scenically.

And now, a recent study—led by professor Patricio Pliscoff of the Universidad Austral de Chile’s Austral Patagonia Program, which is supported by The Pew Charitable Trusts—has shown that Chilean Patagonia also features vast areas with great potential as climate refuges for biodiversity.

Climate refuges are areas capable of remaining stable in the face of extreme climate change—thus serving as a haven for species, ecosystems, and biological processes that could otherwise disappear. Identifying these areas is vital for ensuring their conservation and for developing adequate management plans for established protected areas that could also serve as biodiversity refuges.

Although the December 2022 study identifies potential refuges on land throughout Patagonia, they are concentrated in three specific regions: Chiloé Island and Palena Province in the Los Lagos Region; in the Aysén Region’s inland zone, between the coast and the steppe; and in Chile’s southeastern continental tip and the northern part of the island of Tierra del Fuego, in the Magallanes Region.

The potential marine refuges, meanwhile, involve five large areas of Chilean Patagonia’s waters: in the north of the Los Lagos Region’s Chiloé Island; in the Aysén Region’s Guaitecas archipelago; and in various parts of the Magallanes Region, such as the inland channels of the Bernardo O’Higgins National Park and inside the Kawésqar National Reserve.

The study also found that 46 of Chilean Patagonia’s 58 protected areas coincide with potential climate refuges—including Hornopirén National Park, the Futaleufú National Reserve, and the Palena Lake National Reserve among the land-based refuges, and Bernardo O’Higgins National Park, the Kawésqar National Reserve, and Diego Ramírez-Drake Passage Marine Park among the marine refuges.

To identify these potential climate refuges, the researchers used a methodology combining biodiversity, geodiversity, and climatic variables.

The New York Times NYT reported on Thursday, September 15, 2022 that Yvon Chouinard, the founder of clothing maker Patagonia, has transferred the voting stock (representing 2% of the value of the company) of this $3 billion company to a purpose trust. And, the non-voting stock (representing 98% of the value of the company), that receives the annual profits of the company worth $100 million, transferred to a private foundation. This structure was decided upon as the best way of meeting Chouinard’s objectives, which includes worker well-being and climate action, and after his children decided that they did not want to own the company.

The alternatives looked to achieve his objectives included selling the company or going public, making the company into an employee cooperative, donating all of the stock, voting and non-voting, to a private foundation, and using a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, or SPAC. The fact that he did so, highlights the relatively recent development of Business Purpose Trusts in the U.S., the centerpiece of what Alexander Bove Jr. wrote in Estate Planning Magazine “The Ultimate Business Succession Plan”. So, what is a purpose trust and how does it meet Chouinard’s objectives?

Purpose trusts are not new, they are specifically referred to in section 409 of the Uniform Trust Act, which is adopted in most states. Usually purpose trusts are associated with specific objectives, such as Pet Trusts, Perpetual Care Trusts for cemeteries, and for social purposes that do not qualify for charitable deductions, such as a social club. The difference between a purpose trust and other private trusts is that the beneficiary of the trust is a purpose, not individual or a group of beneficiaries. The governance of the Purpose Trust is, at a minimum, a Board of Trustees to manage the trust and the appointment of a person or committee that can enforce the purpose of the trust, usually called the Trust Protector. The term of the purpose trust can be for a specific term of years or, in some states, in perpetuity.

Perpetual Purpose Trusts have, in the past, worked well when the purpose is specific, such as care of a pet, or tied to tangible or real property, such as artwork, family homesteads and, as mentioned, cemeteries. These purposes are relatively immutable and easily defined. There is less experience in the United States of using Perpetual Business Purpose Trusts for the control of an operating business, though they have been used elsewhere, like in Europe, for centuries. The reason why a Business Purpose Trust may be a challenge to operate is that an operating company has to make money now and into the future, requiring that is continually evolve as the marketplace changes to be profitable and, in the Patagonia case, to fulfill a level of satisfaction for its employees, customers and its community.

Unfortunately, most state statutes enabling the use of Purpose Trust set few if any guidelines on how to set up the governance of Purpose Trusts which control a business, or Business Purpose Trusts. One of the few that has is Oregon, but this legislation was enacted just before the Pandemic so how well this works in real life is yet to be seen.

The Patagonia Perpetual Trust and the non-profit Holdfast Collective is, in my opinion, and elegant strategy to achieve Yvon Chouinard’s, and his family’s, objectives. Though the Purpose trust they will be able to ensure the succession of the management of the company and, hopefully, its profitable existence for decades to come as well as a high level of satisfaction for all of the stakeholders in the company. Through the Collective, those public policy and charitable purposes of Chouinard will benefit from the profits of the company. The only one who loses will be the government, since if the entire $3 billion value of the company was taxable Chouinard’s estate would owe $1.6 billion, or more if after 2025, in federal estate taxes.

I wish MR. Chouinard, his family, Patagonia and all of the other stakeholders in this venture the best of luck and, like many who help with closely held business succession, I will be watching how things work out with interest.","['Matthew Erskine', 'Amy Danise']",2022-09-16 00:00:00

Patagonia, which turns 50 this year, declares on its T-shirts and elsewhere that its goal is “to save our home planet.” This may sound rather grand from a company that sells fleece vests and parkas, but Mr. Gellert, 51, notes that Patagonia has a history of harnessing retail to support its environmental agenda. For decades, it has been increasing the share of recycled materials in its products, supporting factories that pay fair wages and donating 1% of its sales to green causes. Last September, Yvon Chouinard, Patagonia’s founder, announced that he was donating the company to a trust and a nonprofit that would use its earnings—some $100 million a year—to fund efforts to fight climate change. “Earth is now our only shareholder,” declared Mr. Chouinard.",['Emily Bobrow'],

https://www.eastman.com/en/media-center/news-stories/2022/patagonia-chooses-naia-renew,Patagonia chooses Naia™ Renew ES for its low impact line of work tees,"KINGSPORT, Tennessee

Eastman, maker of Naia™ Renew sustainable fibers and yarns, announces that it has collaborated with Patagonia® to offer a limited run of T-shirts made with Naia™ Renew ES — Eastman’s latest fiber offering made with increased recycled content — for the outdoor apparel retailer’s Workwear line.

Named for its enhanced sustainability, Naia™ Renew ES is made with 60% recycled content. Unlike other cellulose-based yarns and fibers, this option requires fewer virgin materials to make an environmentally friendly product. Naia™ Renew ES is made from a combination of molecularly recycled waste material (40%), recycled cellulose (20%) and renewable wood pulp (40%).

The 20% recycled cellulose comes from waste materials, textiles waste and non-forest-derived cellulose waste. This innovation is made possible through Eastman’s continuous efforts to collaborate with eco-conscious partners throughout the value chain. For example, the Naia™ team has partnered with GP Cellulose, a pulp supplier with a focus on sustainability, to integrate renewable forest fibers and non-forest fiber solutions into its feedstock.

The remaining 40% recycled content* comes from Eastman’s cutting-edge molecular recycling technology that breaks down hard-to-recycle waste materials like plastic packaging and old carpet into fundamental building blocks to produce the acetic acid used to make cellulose acetate yarn and fiber. This process not only produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions but also diverts waste materials from landfills, incinerators and other undesirable end-of-life destinations, finding new value for pre- and postconsumer waste that is not suitable for recycling by traditional means.",[],

Moonshot’s main ingredient, wheat, is grown with regenerative agriculture and organic practices, and it is traceable to the farm and the field. Farmers, the miller and the manufacturer in the supply chain are within 100 miles of each other, which results in a lower carbon footprint.

Sausalito-based Patagonia Provisions sources ingredients that rebuild soil, protect the health of ocean ecosystems and protect the environment.

“Moonshot has achieved impressive growth by producing and selling delicious and nutritious crackers with a materially improved carbon footprint compared to industry standard practices,” said Paul Lightfoot, general manager of Patagonia Provisions. “Moonshot’s values and mission are strongly aligned with Patagonia Provisions, which made it easy to warmly welcome their people onto our team.”

Moonshot is so named because the company is “shooting for the moon by taking a bite out of climate change, one cracker at a time.” The crackers are carbon-neutral.

“I founded Moonshot with the vision of using the power of food to help tackle climate change,” said Julia Collins, founder of Moonshot. “By joining Patagonia Provisions, who recently made Earth their only shareholder, Moonshot now belongs to the planet. I cannot imagine a more spectacular path forward for our mission, our team and our climatarian community.”",[],
https://news.mongabay.com/2022/12/in-patagonia-a-pumas-life-is-decided-by-political-borders/,"In Patagonia, a puma’s life is decided by political borders","Human-wildlife conflict has caused a decline in the puma population in parts of Argentinian Patagonia, research shows.

One of Patagonia’s emblematic species, the puma is treated very differently by Argentina and Chile, the two countries that share the region.

The Argentinian province of Chubut pays a puma bounty to incentivize the hunting of pumas, as a measure to counter livestock killings.

Chile has outlawed puma hunting and has found a delicate balance between ranching and conservation.

“As a boy, my father killed pumas,” says Vincente Navarra, whose family has been raising sheep against the backdrop of Argentina’s Patagonian wilderness for generations. Navarra, a 71-year-old rancher who raises livestock on Patagonia’s Chilean side was the first in his family to cross the border to produce wool there.

Not many people can endure the harsh conditions of Patagonia, a region spread across more than 1 million square kilometers (386,000 square miles), split between Chile to the west and Argentina to the east. Ranchers are among them. But pumas’ appetite for livestock has made it difficult for ranchers to peacefully share a territory with the big cat.

“We were taught to fear the puma and that made it easier to hunt them,” Navarra tells Mongabay about Patagonia’s biggest predator and its relationship with the ranchers inhabiting the region.

He remembers discovering three of his lambs killed by a puma on his ranch. “It was disturbing to see that because our sheep are not pets. They are our jobs and our lives. Without them we don’t have money,” Navarra says.

Pumas (Puma concolor) were once persecuted throughout Patagonia, regardless of the country, as ranchers hunted the big cats to protect their livestock. Now, the puma’s fate changes depending on which side of the border you’re in. In Chile, a puma might run into wildlife photographers and park rangers. Cross over to the east into Argentina, and it might be greeted with poison, traps, and gunfire.

The pest of the east

Pumas are opportunistic carnivores whose diets largely depend on prey availability and abundance. In the wild, they hunt coatis, hares, deer, guanacos and tapirs, but in areas with abundant livestock, like Patagonia, horses, sheep and goats become easy targets. According to park officials in Chile’s Torres del Paine National Park, a single puma can kill several sheep, calves, goats and foals in a night — a considerable financial blow to a rancher’s bottom line, particularly for those practicing agriculture on a smaller scale.

In the Argentinian province of Chubut, where Navarra grew up, pumas are considered a pest. “Many ranchers, myself included, thought of them as a plague,” Navarra tells Mongabay. “If your animals die, whether it is from a predator or a disease, it’s all the same. I thought of pumas as a plague for many years because of what they could do to my sheep.”

Argentina is a top exporter of beef and wool, producing most of it in Patagonia, where, in the 20th century, natural habitat was converted into ranchland to accommodate growing livestock populations. But as sheep gained more territory, they started pushing out native species, including the puma’s wild prey, such as guanacos, forcing the feline to look for food elsewhere — usually among farmers’ livestock.

After Navarra discovered the dead lambs and word got out that a puma might be around, he remembers the ranchers resorting to strychnine, a poisonous chemical often used as a pesticide. “I think they were using the poison to kill any puma before it could kill their animals,” Navarra says. “After that, I didn’t see signs of any puma for a long time. It was years before I saw one again in Chubut.”

In the northern part of Patagonia, goat herders lose an average of 6% of their capital in livestock each year because of pumas, according to data from the Wildlife Conservation Society Argentina. That’s a number that some expect to increase if puma habitat in Patagonia continues to decline. A 2017 study estimated that every year the average ranch loses roughly $3,400 because of puma attacks.

Historically, Argentinian law has supported the war against pumas. In 1905, the government passed a law that listed the felines as varmints, which made puma hunting, trapping and poisoning common in the provinces of Chubut and Rio Negro.

Bounty payouts for a puma pelts remain legal in parts of Argentina, which has led to worrying population declines in Argentinian Patagonia, said Martin Font, communications director for conservation nonprofit Fundacion Vida Silvestre. Puma bounties, now legal in four provinces, including Chubut and Rio Negro, were introduced in 1995 in an effort to protect livestock. With Chubut still serving as Argentina’s foremost sheep-ranching province, local authorities updated Chubut’s bounty payouts in 2021 to pay ranchers 5,000 pesos ($30) per puma and 1,000 pesos ($6) per Andean fox (Lycalopex culpaeus). In May 2021, provincial authorities announced they had purchased and distributed 550 puma traps to ranchers. According to the 2017 study, a total of about 2,000 puma bounties are paid each year between the provinces of Chubut, Rio Negro and Neuquén.

Chilean park officials have reported cases of Argentinians, eager to cash in on the puma bounty, crossing the border into Chile to illegally hunt the cats, though these cases are fewer and data is limited.

Puma hunters in both Chile and Argentina kill up to 100 pumas each year, according to Nicolas Lagos Silva, conservation researcher for the puma program at global wild cat conservation NGO Panthera. Each kill pays out between $50 and $400 depending on the country, province and employer; in addition to the bounties offered by provincial authorities in Argentina, ranchers will sometimes pay hunters themselves to exterminate the cats, Lagos Silva says.

Western protection

In Chile, it was once far more common to spot a dead puma than a living one, according to Heriberto Yaeger, a park ranger in Torres del Paine National Park. “The Laguna Amarga ranch which borders the park was once exclusively dedicated to raising sheep. This made the pumas the worst enemy of the ranchers,” Yaeger tells Mongabay.

But in 1980, the Chilean government prohibited the hunting of pumas. Coupled with the added protection of Torres del Paine National Park, puma populations bounced back in Chile, particularly within the park’s boundaries, according to a 2021 study. The park’s current population estimates vary between 50 and 200 pumas, Torres del Paine, officials told Mongabay. Within Torres del Paine, officials estimate there are between 50 and 100 cats, though an exact figure remains uncertain.

Chile has successfully helped ranchers and pumas coexist. Using guard dogs and enclosing sheep at night helps minimize puma attacks, according to park rangers. Building anti-predation fences has also been promoted in hopes of mitigating the ongoing conflict. And it’s not just pumas; all native carnivores are under legal protection in Chile, meaning that lethal means of dealing with pumas or foxes could get a rancher into trouble. Provincial authorities help ranchers obtain nonlethal means to mitigate attacks, though the extent of such support varies by province, a 2019 study found.

“Chile today is much different than Argentina when it comes to ranching with pumas around,” Navarra says. “I have not lost any sheep since I came to Chile, but even if I did, it’d be illegal for me to retaliate.”

Some ranchers have even given up ranching in favor of becoming ecotourism operators, taking high-paying tourists into the field to watch and photograph the very cats they once hunted.

The rise in ecotourism in Chile has made puma conflicts less frequent, park officials say. All of the ranches surrounding Chile’s Laguna Amarga, once a place dominated by sheep ranching, have converted their properties into ecotourism lodges, Yaeger says. As a result, puma hunting is virtually unheard of today within the bounds of Laguna Amarga and Torres del Paine.

“There are ranchers today that see the puma as an important element of the ecosystem and that it must be protected,” Lagos Silva says. “Some ranches have sought economic alternatives such as puma sighting tourism, as a way to obtain an economic benefit by having pumas within their ranches. More ranchers are starting to see pumas as an animal that can bring them economic benefits, so the puma is protected.”

The fate of Patagonia’s big cats

In the mid-1900s, pumas were largely erased from the Argentinian steppe in Patagonia. But when human populations in rural areas began to decline, Patagonia’s top predator began to return. WCS Argentina found that pumas reclaimed roughly 91% of their original territory in just 10 years once human encroachment had stopped.

The pumas of Patagonia have made a considerable rebound in recent decades, partly due to a decline in wool production in Chile and Argentina, coupled with a rise in ecotourism. While this has been celebrated by environmentalists, many ranchers, particularly in Argentina, have not been as pleased. The puma’s comeback has led some ranchers to view the animals as an invasive species.

Some NGOs, including WCS Argentina and Panthera, have stepped up in Argentina to try to emulate Chile’s conservation efforts, focusing to shift puma consumption of domesticated livestock to native prey like the guanaco. But even if the conflict between humans and pumas eases, the felines and their habitat remain at risk.

Livestock, and particularly sheep raising, has caused significant land degradation in Patagonia, affecting soil quality and native flora and fauna, according to a 2000 study. While the Chilean government has helped rewild its share of Patagonia, Argentina is still not quite there. Some cases in Argentina’s Chubut province indicate that measures aimed at restoring native ecosystems and the wildlife inhabiting them, like the puma, would be more welcomed by ranchers if they were involved in conservation as equals and even consultants.

“To protect the puma, people must care,” Navarra says. “Conservation really should involve everyone, from the government official to the rancher. As a boy, I was frightened by the puma. As a man, I was angry at the puma. Today, I worry about the puma.”

On the Shelf A Forest Journey: The Role of Trees in the Fate of Civilization (Revised) By John Perlin

Patagonia: 520 pages, $38

Beginning 385 million years ago, trees made the proliferation of life on Earth possible. With the emergence of Archaeoptreis, one of the earliest modern trees, our carbon dioxide-blanketed planet was transformed into a hospitable environment for other life forms, including vertebrates and ultimately humans, to develop and flourish. It goes almost without saying that we are not repaying the favor.

The extensive history of forests, from the distant past to our current climate chaos, and the little recognized role wood products served in the development of human civilizations is the life’s work of author John Perlin. In 1989, the Los Angeles native published “A Forest Journey: From Mesopotamia to North America.” Now, 34 years later, with the help of two influential supporters, the book is embarking on a new journey.

An updated third edition of “ A Forest Journey ” is out next week from a new publisher, Patagonia. Yes, that Patagonia. The company that began manufacturing pitons in 1973 and became a global outdoor apparel giant began its own publishing program in 2007.

Perlin, now 78, is also the author of three books on solar energy and a visiting scholar in the department of physics at UC Santa Barbara. Until 2018, he was unaware that the co-founders of Patagonia, Malinda and Yvon Chouinard, were devoted fans who had spent years recommending the book to anyone who would listen. That year, he received an email from publisher Karla Olson, sharing that the Chouinards had first read “A Forest Journey” 25 years ago and had never forgotten the book’s message.

Patagonia’s book program began after Yvon Chouinard published his business memoir, “Let My People Go Surfing,” in 2005. The first book his company published was “Yosemite in the Sixties” by Glen Denny, a collection of black-and-white rock climbing photography in the Yosemite Valley. Patagonia quickly ramped up to between five and eight titles per year, including adventure stories, memoirs by athletes and explorers, and books by pioneering environmental scientists.

Last year, the Chouinards transferred their family’s ownership of the private company to a specially designed trust and nonprofit organization devoted to environmental sustainability, although they remain heavily involved across Patagonia — including its books division.

Perlin’s book is a natural fit for the imprint, and it couldn’t be more timely, given its emphasis on mitigating climate change by renewing our symbiotic relationship with the trees that have sustained us. “A Forest Journey” is an approachable, accessible monograph with an impressively broad scope. From construction to fuel to weaponry, Perlin shows that wood may be humanity’s most essential material.

When “A Forest Journey” was first published, the intertwined history of people and trees was a little-explored topic. The book was recognized as a Harvard Classic in Science and World History and was listed as one of the university’s One Hundred Great Books. David Graeber, an anthropologist who would go on to write bestselling historical narratives, compared it to “some Greek epic poem spanning 4,000 years of civilization” in a review for The Times.

By 2017, however, it was difficult to find a copy; the “inevitably tragic” book, as Graeber had put it, faded in popularity among readers likely more accustomed to zippier histories of resources like cod or salt. But for the Chouinards, “A Forest Journey’’ remains a foundational conservation story, one that helps contextualize the current climate crisis. And so they asked to republish it.

“Oh, you might say it was the dream of my life,” Perlin said by video from his home in Santa Barbara, on how it felt to receive their invitation.

Not only was Patagonia offering to revive the relatively obscure title but it would also provide an opportunity for the insatiably curious scholar to supplement his edition with new research.

“I kept piling up ideas, and also in the last 30 years of scholarship, I had all this wonderful material, and no one wanted it,” he said. “And then suddenly, my angels come flying up from Ventura.”

The new, expanded edition, now subtitled “The Role of Trees in the Fate of Civilization,” was originally scheduled to publish in 2020 but was delayed when Patagonia put its books on pause during the COVID-19 pandemic. The silver lining: It gave Perlin more time to add new material, including a section on forests and human health. Olson described Perlin as “incredibly erudite,” and this is evident on the page.

New research has demonstrated that deforestation increases the spread of diseases like Lyme in the northeastern United States, and a 2018 paper in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology theorized that bats and coronaviruses were linked to human interference with natural habitats. It was a prescient finding that Perlin felt compelled to add to “A Forest Journey,” timely evidence of the critical relationship between trees and human health.

Aligning with its mission for sustainability and environmental protection, Patagonia uses 100% post-consumer waste recycled paper. “A Forest Journey” contained extensive end notes, tallying 80 pages; in an effort to reduce paper use, these were replaced by online resources to house footnotes and interactive maps, along with a forthcoming teachers guide. Another hallmark of the books is its striking use of images alongside the text. The book is studded with commanding color photography and graphics, creating an immersive landscape that leavens the dense text.

“We’re a little, tiny piece of the publishing industry, but we’re trying to challenge [publishers] to rethink the way they do some things, including printing on virgin paper,” Olson said.

Perlin wants people to understand that trees are the reason for the development of culture, including books. “Wood, in fact, is the unsung hero of the technological revolution that has brought us from stone-and-bone culture to our present age,” he writes.

What Perlin jokingly calls his “wood work” was inspired by a story from 5,000 years ago in southern Mesopotamia, recorded on a clay tablet as “The Epic of Gilgamesh.”

“I will fell the great forest,” cried the legendary Sumerian hero. Perlin believes this has become the mantra of society ever since Gilgamesh and his men plundered the great primeval woodland. From the Fertile Crescent to ancient Chinese and Indian empires to the more recent arrival of European colonists to North America, Perlin reveals a repeated pattern of humans failing to see the forests for the trees.

“Sadly the present assault on our forests is part of the same cycle begun thousands of years ago,” he writes. “Every Old World starts out as virgin land attractive to human settlement. Subsequent exploitation by humans wears out the land, forcing them to move on to their next New World. This quest for new frontiers, which many have thought peculiar to the American experience, is repeated again and again.”

Perlin’s 30,000-foot purview is what interests Olson. “It is so broad both over time, and culturally, and it is a really interesting perspective that I think is going to surprise people,” she said.

The book’s reissue gave Perlin, now 78, an opportunity to add new research. (John Perlin Collection)

Archaeoptreis made much of life possible, and unless the current cycle of land degradation is broken, the absence of trees will lead to the absence of most everything else. Three progressively warming decades since “The Forest Journey” was first published, the new edition highlights the ways in which we can protect old-growth forests, which are natural vessels for carbon sequestration. Cities like New York and Seattle now recognize the value of sustaining trees for maintaining the integrity of freshwater supply, investing in conservation easements to protect forests and watersheds — a new ray of hope at the end of Perlin’s story.

“I tried to use 1,000 voices of the past,” Perlin said of his storytelling method. Of those many voices he collected in writing “A Forest Journey,” the author wonders whether we will continue to mimic Gilgamesh’s battle cry, which ultimately cursed him, or if we might exercise our voices to ensure our own survival.

https://earth911.com/business-policy/patagonias-big-shift/,Patagonia’s Big Shift,"When Patagonia announced that it would dedicate all profits to environmental charities, it generated a lot of “This changes everything!” rhetoric. But can one company really change everything? What did Patagonia actually change? On the surface, this seems like exactly the sort of investment in the Earth that EarthDay.org calls for. Has Patagonia really found the path to a sustainable green economy? Or is this just another case of corporate greenwashing?

Patagonia

Patagonia has a long history as a socially and environmentally conscious business. Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard is famous for being a reluctant capitalist who got his start as an outdoor enthusiast making gear for his friends. Since 1985, Patagonia has donated an “Earth tax” to environmental causes as one of a few corporations participating in a 1% for the Planet scheme. The company encourages customers to donate to environmental nonprofits as part of an unusual approach to Black Friday.

In contrast to fast fashion, Patagonia’s products are respected as sturdy, long-lasting investment pieces that you rarely, if ever, have to replace. It makes jackets from plastic bottles and recently launched a clothing take-back program. In 2018, it changed its mission statement to state, “We’re in business to save our home planet.” It’s a lot more than most businesses do, but all of these steps are arguably half-measures, and some people could even consider them greenwashing.

Patagonia’s Big Shift

Patagonia took a much bigger step in September. In an open letter, Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard announced a complete restructuring of the company. Now 100% of Patagonia’s voting stock is held by the Patagonia Purpose Trust. All of the nonvoting stock was given to the environmental nonprofit Holdfast Collective. Except for money reinvested in developing the company, all profits will be distributed as a dividend to these stockholding organizations. Essentially, Chouinard donated his entire business to charity – albeit charities that the Chouinard family still runs, and with some fat tax breaks thrown in for good measure.

Broken Ground

Designing a business to donate all profits to charity is not new. Possibly the first to do it was the organic food brand Newman’s Own, which has given 100% of profits to charity since 1982. In the decades since, a handful of other companies have done the same, although until now, none of them were as big as Newman’s.

Patagonia’s restructuring is not quite a copy-paste of Newman’s Own. Patagonia’s perpetual purpose trust structure relies on a tricky – and sometimes sketchy – tax code better known for funding politics than ecosystems. After the initial fanfare, that had a lot of people raising eyebrows. Neither the Patagonia Purpose Trust nor the Holdfast Collective exists or operates separately from Patagonia. As a 501(c)(4) not-for-profit organization, the Collective has a lot of spending freedom. It can advocate for causes and political candidates as well as make grants and investments. With no Charity Navigator score or public track record to examine, only time will tell where the money will end up or how effective it will be.

Limits of Philanthropy

There is also the issue that Patagonia is part of the problem it’s trying to solve. By its own admission, each piece of Patagonia clothing emits several times its weight in greenhouse gases, generates at least another half garment’s worth of scrap, and draws down freshwater resources. No matter what it does with its profits, any company that produces retail consumer goods is causing environmental damage.

Philanthropy – whether corporate or individual – provides an important public service. But as the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (itself funded by one of the nation’s biggest historical philanthropists) points out, philanthropy is stop-gap measure to fill needs left unattended by government. Unlike government action, philanthropy is unregulated, unstructured, and essentially unaccountable for its actions and outcomes. Some people have even argued that modern philanthropy reinforces colonial and racist structures in society. Most people wouldn’t go that far, but there are limits to how much good a global corporation can do.

Patagonia in Perspective

Restructuring one outdoor gear company does not change everything. But the company does seem to be doing as much as a company can. Philanthropy and incremental operational changes are not a replacement for meaningful government action to meet Paris Agreement goals. Nor does it replace responsible individual choices. But they are a critical complement to those things. And Patagonia is raising the bar for corporate environmental responsibility a lot higher than before. It is directing $100 million a year toward environmental causes. In six years, it will have matched 40 years’ worth of Newman’s Own’s donations. That’s a pretty big shift.

On the eve of its 50th anniversary, Patagonia, one of the nation’s most innovative and ethical corporations, is under new ownership.

The outdoor apparel maker, founded in 1973 by Yvon Chouinard and run by the Chouinard family since its inception, announced today that the company has restructured, with the Chouinards ceding control to two private entities: a trust that owns all of Patagonia’s voting stock and a nonprofit called the Holdfast Collective that owns all nonvoting stock and oversees Patagonia’s environmental work, which is set to expand sharply.

In other words, one of the most powerful businessmen in the world just voluntarily gave away his company. And he did it, primarily, to fight climate change.

Effective immediately, 100 percent of Patagonia’s earnings not reinvested in the business will be distributed to the Holdfast Collective, which will use the money to help slow the advance of the climate crisis. The company has for years donated 1 percent of its sales to environmental causes, but this shift is poised to increase that figure dramatically. The charitable outlay of the new company will be roughly $100 million a year.

Ryan Gellert, the company’s current CEO, will remain in place as chief executive, and the Chouinard family will maintain heavy involvement, sitting on the company’s board, guiding the trust that owns the voting stock, and overseeing the philanthropic efforts of the Holdfast Collective. The company’s headquarters will remain in Ventura, California.

Creating a New Corporate Model

Chouinard, 83, started planning the corporate restructuring two years ago. Searching for a way to grow the company’s positive impact on the environment and increasingly queasy about his status as a billionaire, he began exploring options for divesting himself from the business he founded as a tiny mom-and-pop selling climbing gear and grew into a global brand valued at an estimated $3 billion. His thinking followed the path he has famously trod for years: bucking conventional corporate trends and redefining what entrepreneurs are capable of when they wield their businesses as social tools.

“One option was to sell Patagonia and donate all the money,” he wrote in a letter published today. “But we couldn’t be sure a new owner would maintain our values or keep our team of people around the world employed. Another path was to take the company public. What a disaster that would have been. Even public companies with good intentions are under too much pressure to create short-term gain at the expense of long-term vitality and responsibility. Truth be told, there were no good options available. So, we created our own.”

Gellert and a small team of Patagonia executives were tasked with creating the new business model. Under the cover of a project code name—Chacabuco, a nod to a fishing location in Chile—they began brainstorming solutions in mid-2020. Other than selling the company or taking it public, proposals included transforming it into a nonprofit or a consumer-owned co-op, like REI. Eventually they landed on the current plan.

“Two years ago, the Chouinard family challenged a few of us to develop a new structure with two central goals,” Gellert wrote in a release today. “They wanted us to both protect the purpose of the business and immediately and perpetually release more funding to fight the environmental crisis. We believe this new structure delivers on both.”

The restructuring required the Chouinard family—Yvon, his wife Malinda, and their children, Claire and Fletcher—to donate all their company shares to the new trust, officially called the Patagonia Purpose Trust, which will cost them about $17.5 million in gift taxes.

As for the Holdfast Collective, it’s structured as a 501(c)(4), which the company said it chose for the flexibility of the legal entity. 501(c)(4)s are allowed to make unlimited donations to political causes, meaning the Chouinards get no tax benefit for money that flows to the nonprofit.

Patagonia’s head of communications and public policy, Corley Kenna, said to expect the Holdfast Collective to distribute its funds in wide and varied ways: in grants to organizations addressing the root causes of the climate crisis, investments in land and water protection, and support for stronger environmental policy. For a hint at the type of aggressive advocacy Patagonia is likely to go after, Kenna urged people to remember this is the brand that called on its community to “vote the assholes out” during the Trump administration, and joined with grassroots groups in Utah to sue the same administration for its shrinking of Bears Ears National Monument.

In the end, the corporate restructuring—especially the transfer of all nonvoting stock to a nonprofit—was only possible because Patagonia doesn’t offer employee stock options. In his book The Responsible Company, published a decade ago, Chouinard outlined his concerns about employee and public ownership, arguing that wider control of the company’s shares might have prevented a change like the one announced today.

“[We] are concerned that, with shares more broadly distributed, the company would become overly cautious about undertaking risks in the pursuit of its environmental goals,” Chouinard wrote in 2012. “So that Patagonia can continue to push back the boundaries of what business considers possible, [we] are willing to undertake risks that might give pause to broader ownership, even of employees committed to reducing environmental impact.”

Announcing the Changes

The company shared the news with employees in a virtual town hall this morning. In its announcement, Patagonia pointed out that Chouinard is in good health, but that he “wanted to have a plan in place for the future of the company and the future of the planet,” according to Kristine McDivitt Tompkins, a board member.

“The current system of capitalism has made its gains at an enormous cost,” wrote Charles Conn, Patagonia’s board chair, in a release today. “The world is literally on fire. Companies that create the next model of capitalism through deep commitment to purpose will attract more investment, better employees, and deeper customer loyalty. They are the future of business if we want to build a better world, and that future starts with what Yvon is doing now.”

True to its talent for attractively marketing its environmental efforts, Patagonia has devised a pair of slogans that sum up the company’s retooled structure. Instead of going public, the brand has “gone purpose.” And because the Patagonia Purpose Trust is the business’s controlling shareholder and must adhere to the company’s environmental mission, the brand now claims that Earth is its “only shareholder.”

The claim may be less exaggerated than it sounds. The Patagonia Purpose Trust has no individual beneficiaries and the stock it controls can never be sold, meaning, according to deputy general counsel Greg Curtis, “there is no financial incentive, or structural opportunity, for any drift in this trust’s purpose.” An unnamed independent protector has also been designated to “monitor and enforce” the mission of the trust.

“It’s been a half-century since we began our experiment in responsible business,” Chouinard wrote today, addressing the company’s roughly 3,500 employees. “If we have any hope of a thriving planet 50 years from now, it demands all of us doing all we can with the resources we have. As the business leader I never wanted to be, I am doing my part. Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth, we are using the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source. We’re making Earth our only shareholder. I am dead serious about saving this planet.”",['Andrew Weaver'],2022-09-14 20:42:13+00:00

The area, a popular destination for rock climbers, was recently designated as Chile’s newest nature sanctuary. Mathew Scott

Chilean Patagonia’s Cochamó Valley, home to some of the largest granite walls in South America, has become a paradise for rock climbers. But since Jan. 26, the valley stands out for another reason: It’s Chile’s newest nature sanctuary.

The Cochamó Valley Nature Sanctuary protects rivers and wetlands, along with 6,500 hectares (about 25 square miles) of mature forest and more than 1,800 hectares (about 7 square miles) of thousand-year-old larches—conifers categorized as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In total, the sanctuary—designated by the Chilean government’s Council of Ministers for Sustainability—covers roughly 11,000 hectares, or about 42 square miles.

The designation follows years of collaboration led by the community and supported by civic organizations. Notably, it also recognizes practices and places of key cultural importance to area residents, including Patagonia’s muleteer-gaucho culture and the historic trail connecting Cochamó with Argentina. In addition, the sanctuary includes protections for Rehuelhué, public land in the Los Lagos Region that’s vital to the conservation of the huemul—also known as the South Andean deer—one of Chile’s most iconic and endangered species.

The local community began organizing a decade ago to demand conservation of the valley—which, despite its high natural, cultural, and touristic value, had no official protection until now, making it vulnerable to threats such as real estate development, hydroelectric dams, and uncontrolled tourism. A community group known as the Organización del Valle de Cochamó led the effort—with technical assistance from the local nonprofit Puelo Patagonia, in partnership with The Pew Charitable Trusts—as part of a participatory process that will help ensure the sanctuary’s sustainable management and administration over time.

In fact, the next step will be developing a participatory governance model and management plan designed to balance the recreational needs of the thousands of tourists who visit the area each year with the need to protect the sanctuary from both an ecological and cultural standpoint.

KINGSPORT, Tenn., Sept. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Eastman, maker of Naia™ Renew sustainable fibers and yarns, announces that it has collaborated with Patagonia® to offer a limited run of T-shirts made with Naia™ Renew ES — Eastman's latest fiber offering made with increased recycled content — for the outdoor apparel retailer's Workwear line.

Named for its enhanced sustainability, Naia™ Renew ES is made with 60% recycled content. Unlike other cellulose-based yarns and fibers, this option requires fewer virgin materials to make an environmentally friendly product. Naia™ Renew ES is made from a combination of molecularly recycled waste material (40%), recycled cellulose (20%) and renewable wood pulp (40%).

The 20% recycled cellulose comes from waste materials, textiles waste and non-forest-derived cellulose waste. This innovation is made possible through Eastman's continuous efforts to collaborate with eco-conscious partners throughout the value chain. For example, the Naia™ team has partnered with GP Cellulose, a pulp supplier with a focus on sustainability, to integrate renewable forest fibers and non-forest fiber solutions into its feedstock.

The remaining 40% recycled content* comes from Eastman's cutting-edge molecular recycling technology that breaks down hard-to-recycle waste materials like plastic packaging and old carpet into fundamental building blocks to produce the acetic acid used to make cellulose acetate yarn and fiber. This process not only produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions but also diverts waste materials from landfills, incinerators and other undesirable end-of-life destinations, finding new value for pre- and postconsumer waste that is not suitable for recycling by traditional means.

""Patagonia has always been a company that chooses its fibers carefully and responsibly,"" said Ruth Farrell, Eastman textiles general manager. ""The collaboration we've enjoyed with Patagonia has been instrumental in developing materials that appeal to its customers — environmentally conscientious people who work and play hard. Patagonia customers want garments that reflect who they are and what they care about without compromise on comfort and quality.""

Patagonia's Workwear line is a Fair Trade line of apparel made for people who work hard daily to make the planet a better place to live, perform and produce. It features durable, low-impact fibers with a lower carbon footprint. Learn more at www.patagonia.com/workwear.

Naia™ fibers and yarns are responsibly sourced from sustainably managed pine and eucalyptus forests. Eastman has aligned its entire forestry supply chain with Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) sourcing standards, including controlled wood procedures. Eastman holds FSC® (C140711) and PEFC™ Chain of Custody certifications, and all its suppliers hold internationally recognized forestry certifications as well. Furthermore, Eastman has partnered with Canopy to demonstrate its ongoing commitment to sustainable forestry management.

""Now more than ever, people want to know how and where our clothes are made, paying particular attention to what they're made from,"" Farrell said. ""Naia™ Renew ES is our answer to the overconsumption of raw materials, a growing plastic waste problem, and rising greenhouse gases caused by deforestation. It's a future-focused fiber made with the next generations in mind — one that doesn't compromise on the quality of the garment or the health of our planet.""

Outdoor gear company Patagonia says “the earth is now our only shareholder” after transferring the company's ownership from founder Yvon Chouinard and his family to two nonprofits established to fight climate change.

In a letter posted on the 50-year-old company’s website Wednesday night, Chouinard said Patagonia would transfer 100% of its voting stock to the Patagonia Purpose Trust, created to uphold the values of the company long known for its environmental activism. All of its nonvoting stock will go to the Holdfast Collective, a nonprofit “dedicated to fighting the environmental crisis and defending nature.”

“While we’re doing our best to address the environmental crisis, it’s not enough,” Chouinard wrote. “We needed to find a way to put more money into fighting the crisis while keeping the company’s values intact.”

Patagonia estimates that after reinvesting some profits back into the company, about $100 million annually will be distributed to the Holdfast Collective as a dividend, depending on the health of the business.

Grace Chiang Nicolette, The Center for Effective Philanthropy's vice president of programming and external relations, said this unusual move by the Chouinard family may become a blueprint for company founders looking to donate their businesses to causes important to them.

“Business owners are often faced with fraught decisions on the future of their company when it’s time to sell,” said Nicolette, who also co-hosts the “Giving Done Right” podcast. “The very wealthy are also faced with the fact that their net worths are growing faster than they can conceive of giving it away. This plan makes the company’s social impact its guiding principle and I think we’re going to see more donors pursuing this approach.”

Chouinard said other options for the Ventura, California, company to dedicate itself to protecting the planet — selling the company and donating the proceeds; or taking the company public — were not viable for Patagonia’s ultimate goals.

“Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth,” Chouinard wrote.

Chuck Collins, the Institute for Policy Studies director of the Program on Inequality and the Common Good, said Chouinard's actions reflect a personal connection to the environmental crisis and a desire to back up his beliefs with his wealth.

“It shows that somebody who has substantial wealth is responding with the kind of scale needed to address the problem,” he said. “He's working with the tools that he's got. And it's a pretty good response.”

Patagonia CEO Ryan Gellert said in a statement that the Chouinards challenged him and others at the company to develop a new ownership structure.

“They wanted us to both protect the purpose of the business and immediately and perpetually release more funding to fight the environmental crisis,” Gellert wrote. ""We believe this new structure delivers on both and we hope it will inspire a new way of doing business that puts people and planet first.”

Brian Mittendorf, a professor of accounting at Ohio State University who focuses on nonprofit organizations and their financial statements, said the new Patagonia structure is similar to the one Paul Newman created for his salad dressing company, Newman's Own. The profits from the business go into the Newman's Own Foundation, which donates to nonprofits supporting children facing adversity.

The difference is that the Holdfast Collective is organized as a 501(c)4 corporation, according to the New York Times, which first reported the ownership change. That allows it to lobby politicians, which a public benefit charity like Newman's Own Foundation is not allowed to do.

“What I don't think is getting enough attention here is that the tax advantages of choosing a donation to a charity over a social welfare organization just aren't that pronounced in this particular case,” said Mittendorf. He noted that the gift tax the Chouinards will pay is on their initial investment in Patagonia, not on its current worth, estimated at $3 billion.

“I kind of just view it as a desire to retain control over the company while ensuring that the resources that the company generates are used for a particular goal,” he said.

Patagonia makes outdoor clothing, gear and accessories for everything from skiing to climbing and camping. The company said it will continue its previous charitable donations, including donating 1% of its sales each year to grassroots activists and remaining a B Corp, a designation for companies that prioritize social and environmental standards as well as profits.

Patagonia sells its Snap-T fleece for $149 or less—but the colorful midlayer could be worth a lot more than that if things go the brand’s way in court.

Last week, Patagonia filed a lawsuit against Gap, accusing the apparel company of copying its longstanding Snap-T fleece design. The complaint includes a photo of one of Gap’s pullover fleeces, calling it a “look-a-like product” that is “using a highly similar rectangular logo, all designed to make it appear as though Patagonia is the source of Gap’s products or has collaborated with Gap.” Both garments feature a bright, colorblocked pattern; a snap-closure neck; a triangular, snap-closure chest pocket; and a rectangular logo above the pocket featuring a mountain skyline. Gap’s version is currently available on its website for $79.95.

According to the lawsuit, which the brand filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Patagonia launched the first version of the pullover in 1985 and added the snap pocket four years later, “and an iconic design was born.” The piece appeared in a 2017-2018 exhibition called “Items: Is Fashion Modern?” at New York’s Museum of Modern Art; the show’s catalog noted that the Snap-T’s “functionality and bright color palette took fleece out of the woods and onto the street.” The Snap-T was also featured in the “Values of Design” exhibition, which debuted in 2017 at the Victoria and Albert Gallery in Shenzhen, China. The fleece has remained in Patagonia’s line for decades.

“A brand’s value is in its distinguishing features,” says Sarah Hartley, a partner at international law firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner who specializes in part in outdoor industry legal issues (she is not involved in this lawsuit). Not only can trademark infringement take away a brand’s sales, she notes, but it also devalues a company’s reputation. “Particularly with Patagonia’s forward-looking and progressive political stances that they’ve taken, there are people who want to be associated with them. That consumer connection is really valuable. You want to make sure that you don’t have people trying to trade off of the goodwill that you’ve built up with your customers over many years.”

The document, which does not name a specific dollar amount for damages, lays out a long list of harms Gap has caused, including making the public falsely believe Patagonia has partnered with Gap, damaging Patagonia’s reputation, diluting its trademarks, and deceiving customers. It even includes a one-star Gap customer review for the pullover calling it an “Obvious Pata*gonia ripoff” and noting “I had to zoom in just to ensure that the logo was Gap.”

Patagonia’s lawsuit also alleges that “there is no question that Gap’s copying has been willful and deliberate,” based on how similar the two designs are. It adds that Patagonia has warned Gap in the past to stop infringing on its products and logo. A spokesperson for Gap declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation; a Patagonia representative also declined to speak with Outside.

This legal action joins a similar lawsuit Patagonia filed against Walmart and one of its suppliers, Robin Ruth USA, in early October. That suit accuses Walmart and Robin Ruth of copying its famous “P-6” trout logo on products like a T-shirt bearing the word “Montana” instead of Patagonia. “In the nearly-50 [sic] years since Patagonia’s business started, PATAGONIA brand and its P-6 logo have become among the most identifiable brands in the world,” the lawsuit states. “Defendants’ actions have caused and will cause Patagonia irreparable harm.”

“This is not an out-of-the-ordinary kind of lawsuit for a business to bring,” Hartley says. “In order to maintain the value of your company, you’re going to do what you need to do to protect your brand.”",[],2022-11-30 21:39:21+00:00
https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2023/01/why-protecting-chilean-patagonias-freshwater-is-crucial,Why Protecting Chilean Patagonia’s Freshwater Is Crucial,"Overview

Chilean Patagonia is known around the world for its extraordinary and relatively pristine ecosystems. With old-growth forests, peat bogs, and fjords that are highly resilient against climate change, the area serves as a large carbon sink and has even been called a climate refuge.

Chile’s 1,251 rivers, however, are completely unprotected, with no laws or other holistic and lasting mechanisms in place to safeguard them.1

Globally, the degradation of rivers and freshwater ecosystems—due to human consumption of water, irrigation, mining, and hydroelectric activities, among other factors—is progressively diminishing local communities’ ability to count on clean drinking water and food. And although freshwater systems cover only 1% of the Earth’s surface, they support 10% of all known species and a third of vertebrates.2 What’s more, the United Nations notes that freshwater species are becoming extinct faster than marine or terrestrial species are.3

That led the International Union for Conservation of Nature to encourage governments in 2020 to “work with civil society, communities, Indigenous groups, the private sector, and others to identify, restore, and protect free-flowing rivers or stretches, and their associated ecosystems, that provide essential services or resilience in a changing climate” and to “balance development by enacting durable legal protections and enhanced governance for rivers, including riparian buffer protections.”4

On the flip side, recent studies have shown that rivers that flow freely and without interruption offer enhanced benefits—such as increased fishery yields and flood plain agriculture—to nearby communities and the river species and ecosystems themselves.5

The Chilean case

The lack of legal protection for Chile’s rivers constitutes a serious threat, given the country’s high vulnerability to climate impacts such as floods, landslides, droughts, and wildfires, as well as pollution and excessive depletion of water resources.6

The good news is that almost all rivers in Chilean Patagonia remain free-flowing and relatively intact from an ecological point of view. But the challenging news is that the pressures on the region’s freshwater ecosystems are increasing.

Because there is currently a window of opportunity to implement conservation measures for the country’s rivers, associated freshwater ecosystems, and their watersheds, in 2021. The Pew Charitable Trusts—along with the Universidad Austral de Chile’s Southern Patagonia Program—began supporting existing efforts and organizations dedicated to protecting freshwater flows in selected river basins and establishing a foundation for broader and more lasting protection of freshwater in the region.

This work has included evaluating legal tools for protecting rivers and their watersheds; scientifically assessing freshwater biodiversity and potential strategies by watershed; and developing an official register of Patagonian rivers in need of protection, beginning with three rivers: the Puelo, Futaleufú, and Serrano.

The project, which also involves the Centro de Investigación en Ecosistemas de la Patagonia, is designed to synthesize and evaluate information on the state of conservation of the entire region’s river systems. In addition, the project’s main organizations have formed coalitions with local nongovernmental organizations to strengthen their efforts to advance watershed conservation. The goal is to extend the collaborative work to local and regional governments, whose support will be essential for the success of freshwater conservation efforts in Chilean Patagonia.

The work in the Puelo, Futaleufú, and Serrano basins is designed to be a case study as part of the national need for permanent protection and restoration of Chile’s freshwater, as well as to face the challenges that climate change and water scarcity will pose in the coming years.

Puelo River

The Pew Charitable Trusts

Located in the Los Lagos Region, with headwaters in the lake of the same name in Argentina. Because it flows toward Chile through the Andes and into the Seno de Reloncaví estuary, its waters are vital to the estuary’s marine environment. The Puelo is environmentally and culturally important for the surrounding communities and provides a livelihood for small farmers, ranchers, and muleteers. Its scenic value has also made it an important source of employment in the region. As one of Chile’s five largest rivers, the Puelo has been the target of several hydroelectric projects—none of which have thrived, although they continue to be among the greatest latent threats to the river’s free flow.

Futaleufú River

Nicole Mansuy

Located in the Los Lagos Region, the northernmost of Chilean Patagonia’s three regions. Futaleufú—which means “big river” in the Indigenous Mapudungun language—is one of Chile’s largest (by volume) and fastest-flowing rivers, traversing a basin that runs from the Argentine side of the Andes to Yelcho Lake and the Pacific Ocean, covering nearly 4,250 square miles (11,000 square kilometers). Its valleys are carved by glaciers and surrounded by native forests, and its rapids make it a world-class rafting and kayaking destination.

Serrano River

The Pew Charitable Trusts

The river’s basin covers some 145 square miles (378 square kilometers) in the Magallanes Region. It includes almost all of Torres del Paine National Park—one of Chile’s most popular tourist destinations—and adjacent private lands as well as part of Bernardo O’Higgins National Park. The river provides freshwater and nutrients to estuaries within the recently declared Kawésqar National Reserve, making it a major contributor of freshwater to this marine area and crucially important to maintaining this ecologically valuable estuarine system.

https://www.travelandleisure.com/trip-ideas/how-to-travel-to-patagonia,How to Travel to Patagonia,"Southern Patagonia, which stretches across Chile and Argentina, has long lured travelers to what is very nearly the end of the world with its storied peaks carved by age-old glaciers and spellbinding landscapes. Here, in the countries' national parks, are snow-capped mountains, cobalt fjords, and old-growth forests. At the southernmost tip of the Americas, icebergs rupture with a dramatic roar from ancient, massive glaciers.

Torres del Paine National Park in Chile and Argentina’s Los Glaciares National Park are the region’s top highlights, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors per year. For a complete Patagonian travel journey, combine visits to both halves of the region. Of course, doing so requires a lot of logistical planning — especially during the high season. Here’s a comprehensive tip sheet to help you maximize your travels in this remote corner of the planet.

When to Go

In El Calafate and Torres del Paine, hotels normally operate from the Southern spring to fall (mid-September to early May). Just a few lodgings remain open year-round, such as the Explora hotel.

To avoid the crowds and still experience good weather, visit during the spring when the flowers are in bloom, or fall when the leaves are a fiery mosaic of red, orange, and yellow. The summer months (December to February) have the mildest weather, but keep in mind that temperatures rarely go above 70 degrees and the winds are strong.

Travelers should be aware that the weather in Patagonia is highly unpredictable, particularly in spring and early summer. Weather and temperatures can fluctuate without warning and violent storms can sweep in from the Pacific. It’s helpful to pad your schedule with additional days in case you encounter inclement weather.

How to Get There

Since distances are quite large in Chile and Argentina, you will need to fly to Patagonia (unless you have several weeks to spare for a road trip). Airline seats fill up quickly during peak season (December to February), so you should purchase tickets as far in advance as possible: Six months is ideal. For other months in the high season (October until early May), book three months ahead to avoid steep fares and limited options.

In Chile, LATAM Airlines serves southern Chilean Patagonia year-round with daily flights between Santiago and Punta Arenas with a flight time just over three hours.

Sky Airlines, Chile’s low-cost provider, also flies non-stop between Santiago and both Puerto Natales as well as Punta Arenas for generally lower fares than LATAM. Puerto Natales fares are cheapest when the flight route is published around August each year. Driving time is three hours between Puerto Natales and Punta Arenas, two hours between Puerto Natales and Torres del Paine National Park, and five hours between Punta Arenas and the park.

In Argentina, meanwhile, Calafate and Ushuaia are the primary entryways. These destinations are serviced by LATAM Airlines and Aerolineas Argentinas.

During the tourist season, LATAM Airlines offers daily flights from Buenos Aires to El Calafate Airport (an easy 3.5-hour trip) with increased service during the high season. Flights are also available from Buenos Aires to Ushuaia and the trip is just shy of four hours in duration.

Aerolineas Argentinas also flies from Buenos Aires to Calafate and Ushuaia and between Ushuaia to Calafate. Los Glaciares National Park, home to the famous Perito Moreno Glacier, is an hour drive from El Calafate Airport. Another popular destination in this region is the trekking mecca El Chaltén, a three-hour drive from El Calafate Airport.

How to Get Around

Most luxury hotels in Southern Patagonia include transfers to and from the airport, as well as transportation for daily excursions.

Traveling between Chile and Argentina can be done easily by land or sea. Unfortunately, there are no flights between Puerto Natales or Punta Arenas to El Calafate or Ushuaia.

For an overland trip, you’ll need to organize a private transfer or catch a bus. The drive takes approximately five hours to cross the border between Argentinian Cancha Carrera and Chilean Cerro Castillo pass, all while traveling along the Patagonian steppe. It’s the same route in either direction you’re traveling.

There are several reputable bus companies that connect Puerto Natales and El Calafate daily, including Buses Fernandez and Buses Sur. The transfer takes five to seven hours, depending on the time spent at customs. Tickets can be purchased either online or at the bus station. Book at least one month in advance, especially during high season.

By sea, Australis cruises run from the end of September to the beginning of April connecting Punta Arenas and Ushuaia. The expeditions navigate fjords, Avenue of the Glaciers, the Strait of Magellan, and Cape Horn.

What to Pack

In Patagonia, travelers will need to be ready for all kinds of weather. Since temperatures can vary between 5 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit in the course of a single day, it’s crucial that travelers layer clothing. A waterproof jacket and trekking boots are highly essential, as is sunscreen and a pair of quality sunglasses (the sun is extremely bright).

If you’re staying in upscale lodges, a suitcase is fine to bring, but a backpack is recommended for multi-day trekking. Smaller backpacks are ideal for full or half-day excursions. Many upscale hotels provide personal water bottles and trekking poles.

Packing Essentials:

Long thermal underwear that wicks perspiration

Water repellent trekking pants

Light pullover or sweatshirt

Fleece or down liner

Waterproof parka or weatherproof jacket

Hat for sun protection

Sunglasses

Sunscreen

Liner or wind stopper gloves

Waterproof trekking boots

Long trekking socks

Neck gaiter

Bug spray

Headlamp

Trekking backpack or day pack

What to do in Chile

Travelers flock to Southern Patagonia to experience the otherworldly beauty of Torres del Paine National Park and spot Patagonia’s wildlife including the Big Five: pumas, llama-like guanacos, South Andean deer known as huemul, Andean condors, and the ostrich-like rhea, or ñandú. There are also flamingoes, foxes, penguins, and more than 100 species of birds. Several tour companies offer multi-day puma-tracking safaris through the park.

Visitors will also want to explore the park’s old-growth forests. In the canopies of primeval southern beech trees (lenga, coihue, ñire) you can spot Magellanic woodpeckers and Austral parakeets.

Full and half-day treks along the famous “W” Circuit (named for the shape of the route) offer one-of-a-kind vistas of sweeping freshwater lakes, teal lagoons, ice floes, and glimmering glaciers. The “W” Circuit is a 43-mile trek that, over the course of four or five days, visits the park’s major attractions and can be walked with overnight stays in refugios (basic dorm-style shelters) or campsites.

Stroll through the colorful fishing town of Puerto Natales, or explore the region’s labyrinth of scenic fjords, where immense glaciers and unusual marine life can be admired from the deck of a boat. On the shores of Punta Arenas, visit penguin colonies at Seno Otway or Magdalena Island and look out for sea lions and whales that populate the waters. You can also kayak the Strait of Magellan.

Where to Stay in Chile

Torres del Paine’s luxury lodges offer all-inclusive packages that incorporate airport transfers, a wide range of full and half-day excursions, and three gourmet meals per day with premium wine and cocktails. Explora is the pioneer of luxury lodges in Southern Patagonia — they offer over 50 explorations led by experienced guides. Fourteen exclusive villas are the signature of Awasi, where guests have their own private guide and four-wheel drive vehicle to explore the scenery at their own pace.

Overlooking Lake Sarmiento and Paine Massif, Tierra Patagonia subscribes to an adventure spa philosophy, where guests are encouraged to unwind after jam-packed days of adventure.

For glampers, the sustainable EcoCamp is a geodesic dome hotel tucked in the middle of the park. Accommodations range from basic to over-the-top, two-story heated tents that boast private terraces, private bathrooms, and ceiling windows facing upward to the Patagonian sky. Assisted camping experiences across the park’s trekking loop can be easily coordinated by operators like Fantástico Sur, Cascada Expediciones, Mountain Travel Sobek, and Swoop Patagonia.

A number of upscale properties are located in and around the colorful fishing town of Puerto Natales. The Singular Patagonia, a property situated on the banks of the Last Hope Sound, is a century-old national monument that’s been refurbished with industrial-chic accents.

At Lakutaia Lodge, on Navarrino Island next to Cape Horn, guests are deeply immersed in the surrounding parklands, glaciers, and fjords. But the real draw for adventurers is the opportunities to helifish and heliski.

What to Eat and Drink

Most of the lodges on private reserves offer full room and board, and employ talented chefs who take advantage of locally-sourced ingredients like white strawberries, rhubarb, seaweed, Patagonian honey, and gamier specialties like guanaco and Patagonian hare.

From the sea, try South American king crab, snook-and-hake ceviche, conger eel, robalo, hake, muscles, choritos (Callao-style steamed mussels), and oysters. Wash it all down with Chilean pisco sours or a bottle of reserve Chilean wine.

Day Trips from Chile

Hotels offer a staggering array of full and half-day excursions for every interest and fitness level that include mountain trekking, horseback riding, cycling, kayaking, sailing scenic fjords, and glacier cruises, among others.

The world-famous trek to the base of Torres del Paine is a must-do. It’s a challenging, eight-hour hike round-trip, but a clear view (weather depending) of the granite spires rising from the turquoise glacial lake is an ample reward.

One of the area’s most popular hikes is the Mirador Las Torres, which crosses the beautiful Pehoe Lake for views of the French Glacier calving from a natural amphitheater.

Take a zodiac voyage across Grey Lake to see the glistening Grey Glacier up close, or visit the Balmaceda and Serrano Glaciers from the wharf in Puerto Natales.

Spend the day with Chilean cowboys at the family-run Estancia Mercedes for horseback riding along fjords.

General Tips for Visiting Chile

When visiting during Chile’s summer months, beware of biting midges. Spray yourself with natural insect repellent at regular intervals and wear light-colored clothing and long sleeves, as these small flies are attracted to dark colors.

If you are an avid hiker, avoid heavy backpacker crowds in Torres del Paine by traveling in November or April. ​ ​

On challenging treks, opt for two trekking poles. It will save your knees on the descent.

What to Do in Argentina

Over 100,000 visitors converge at the 97-square mile Perito Moreno Glacier — a declared UNESCO World Heritage Site in Los Glaciares National Park — every year. Located near El Calafate, it’s one of the world’s most exceptional ice fields and one of only three Patagonian glaciers that continues to grow.

Boat cruises on the lake will take you close enough to witness colossal icebergs spontaneously fragment from the Perito Moreno Glacier and into Lake Argentino below. Some tours give visitors a chance to hike out onto the glacier wearing metal crampons.

Visiting the area’s historic estancias offers travelers a glimpse into the rural life of Patagonian ranchers. The century-old Estancia Cristina on Lake Argentino and Nibepo Aike, a working cattle ranch near El Calafate, are destinations in their own right. Unspoiled landscapes and opportunities to hike, horseback ride, and visit the area’s stunning glaciers are abundant.

Three hours north by car from El Calafate is the laid-back hiking hamlet of El Chalten, famous for its towering Fitz Roy mountain peak. The tiny frontier town is dotted with picturesque chalets and a network of scenic trails that suit every skill level.

You’ll travel to the “end of the world” in Tierra del Fuego. Its capital city, Ushuaia, is a port of arrival or departure when traveling by sea between Argentina and Chile. Take a boat cruise or catamaran trip to see penguins, sea lions, and cormorants inhabiting the legendary Beagle Channel made famous by naturalist Charles Darwin on his Voyage of the Beagle in 1831.

Tierra del Fuego National Park offers a lush sub-Antarctic rainforest shaded with beech trees, while Glacier Martial offers a panoramic view of Ushuaia and the channel. International anglers make pilgrimages to the banks of the Rio Grande in the hope of hooking its record brown trout.

Where to Stay in Argentina

While El Calafate’s main street — Avenue del Libertador General San Martín — is lined with quaint shops and restaurants, the surrounding town lacks the same charm. Two pleasant and affordable places to stay on the southern shore of Lake Argentino are Esplendor Calafate and Xelena.

Eolo Lodge, located 30 minutes west of El Calafate, is built on 10,000 acres of arid steppe and pampas grass with lake views. Antiques, heavy wooden furniture, and mismatched dishware give the lodge a cozy country atmosphere. Nearby, guests can take guided treks, go horseback riding, mountain biking, and birdwatching. The hotel can also arrange excursions to the Perito Moreno and Upsala Glaciers. Book one of the corner suites for a spectacular view.

Travelers can book multi-night stays or take full expeditions from El Calafate to Estancia Cristina, a 20th century sheep ranch only accessible by boat across Lake Argentino. Set on 54,000 acres of wild Patagonian landscape, the preserved estancia offers a menu of excursions that combine trekking, 4x4, and sailing among icebergs near the Upsala Glacier. Fishermen, meanwhile, can ride horseback to glacial lakes near the hotel to catch Chinook salmon and rainbow trout.

Estancia Nibepo Aike is an authentic working ranch founded by a Croatian pioneer at the turn of the 20th century. The estancia still raises cattle and sheep, granting guests the unusual opportunity to shear sheep, learn gaucho (cowboy) skills on horseback, and to sample a traditional prepared asado (barbecue) of Patagonian lamb. Overnight guests can explore the hidden glaciers Gorra, Frías, and Dickson.

Between El Chalten and El Calafate, you can stay at Estancia Helsingfors, a rustic lodge set on the shores of Lake Viedma with great food and stunning mountain views. Five hours from El Calafate on a pristine private nature reserve along Lake San Martin sits Estancia El Condor, named for the nearby condor nesting sites.

Los Cerros, located on a hilltop overlooking El Chalten, is the most luxe option in a backpacking haven brimming with hostels. And the exclusive Aguas Arribas Lodge, an hour drive north of Chalten, is a secluded lakeside retreat looking upon the north face of Mount Fitz Roy.

In Ushuaia, luxury properties Los Cauquenes and Arakur Ushuaia Resort & Spa both overlook the Beagle Channel and offer guided wilderness hikes and sailing excursions.

What to Eat and Drink

Most estancias offer full board with three gourmet meals per day, but there are some local delicacies you must check off your list.

El Calafate gets its name from the calafate berry (barberry), and there is a local legend that says whoever eats a calafate berry will return to Patagonia. Try calafate gelato, calafate liqueur, and delicious jams made from chaura (prickly heath) and zarzaparrilla (wild currant). For grilled cuisine visit La Tablita, and stop at Abuela Goye for an artisanal alfajor and other chocolate treats.

Experiencing an authentic Patagonian asado is a must-do at one of the estancias. Watch the asadors cook local Patagonian lamb on an iron cross over a live fire and enjoy it with a glass of Patagonian pinot noir or a Mendocinean mablec in hand.

In Ushuaia, dine at the restaurant Kaupe: It’s considered one of the best restaurants in Argentina.

Grab an artisanal beer at Cerveceria Beagle, which brews its own beer using meltwater from nearby glaciers.

Arguably the most important and culturally significant of all Argentine drinks is mate. Sipping mate tea is a long-held social ritual that consists of drinking yerba mate (a caffeine-rich blend of dried herbs) steeped in hot water inside a hollowed gourd or wooden mate cup through a bombilla (metal straw). Try adding a little sugar if the taste is too bitter for your palate.

Day Trips from Argentina

A trip to Perito Moreno Glacier in Los Glacieres National Park is one of Patagonia’s most iconic excursions. Hielo & Aventura offers the best big ice and mini-trekking adventures.

Marpatag’s stylish Leal Cruiser takes guests on an all-day glacier adventure sailing along Lake Argentino and visiting the Upsala, Spegazzini, and Perito Moreno glaciers.

A full-day excursion to Estancia Cristina includes a boat ride past glaciers and waterfalls. Cañadon de los Fosiles is a five-hour trek from the estancia with views of Lake Guillermo and the Upsala Glacier, before descending through a valley of ancient fossils.

El Chalten offers a variety of scenic day hikes including the Cerro Torre Trek, an easy six-hour hike, and the more challenging Monte Fitz Roy Trek, an eight-hour hike to Laguna de los Tres. You can also ice hike atop the Viedma Glacier.

In Tierra del Fuego, look for marine wildlife in the Beagle Channel or visit panoramic lookout points on hikes through Tierra del Fuego National Park.

General Tips for Visiting Argentina

Perito Moreno Glacier’s big ice treks have strict age limits — typically from 18 to 65 years old — that differ by tour.

If you plan to spend a night at Estancia Cristina, you will need to overnight in Calafate before and after, as the boat departs early in the morning and returns in the late afternoon.

Avid hikers should visit El Chalten in November or April to avoid heavy crowds.

Outdoor equipment is expensive in Argentina, so be certain you’re well equipped before traveling.

Visas

Capital cities Santiago, Chile and Buenos Aires, Argentina both serve as gateways to Southern Patagonia. As of recently, Americans do not need a visa or have to pay a reciprocity fee to enter either country.

Which side to start on is a matter of personal preference, and also depends on what other destinations are included on your itinerary. However, if you plan to visit both countries, you can start in one city and finish in the other, so you have the opportunity to experience both.

Patagonia Cruises

Australis offers expedition cruises that specialize exclusively in the southern shores of Patagonia. Four to seven-night itineraries can be booked round-trip, or one way to or from Punta Arenas and Ushuaia. The cruise navigates the Strait of Magellan, the Beagle Channel, and stops at Cape Horn National Park, offering travelers the opportunity to go ashore and explore.

Daily zodiac rides explore fjords and glaciers, and cruisers will spot plenty of wildlife including penguin colonies and elephant seals. Each cabin, ranging from 160 to 220 square feet, has a picture window and a private bathroom with a shower.","['Nora Walsh', 'Nora Walsh Is An Award-Winning Writer Who Specializes In Luxury Hotels', 'Latin America', 'The Intersection Of Wellness', 'Adventure Travel.

Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard recently designated the planet as the company’s only shareholder — and as a result, things at the company have changed. By Lizzy Rosenberg Oct. 20 2022, Published 10:09 a.m. ET

You may recall last month, when Patagonia's founder, Yvon Chouinard gave up the company in the name of the planet. The 83-year-old founder of the $3 billion company made the decision to designate ""Earth"" as the brand's sole shareholder. This was, in part, to announce the company would be making some changes in the sustainability department. But what's changed sustainability-wise at Patagonia?

Article continues below advertisement

Following the big reveal on the company's new shareholder, Patagonia implied big changes were coming. However, Chouinard didn't elaborate at the time. “Instead of ‘going public,’ you could say we’re ‘going purpose,’"" Chouinard wrote after the entrepreneur announced his decision to leave the company. “Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth,” he continued.

But it seems as though Chouinard ultimately made the right decision — for his personal life, and for the sake of the company. ""I feel a big relief that I’ve put my life in order,” Chouinard also stated via The New York Times. “For us, this was the ideal solution... Now I could die tomorrow and the company is going to continue doing the right thing for the next 50 years, and I don’t have to be around.""

Sustainability-wise, what's changed at Patagonia since Earth became its primary shareholder?

Since Patagonia made its groundbreaking announcement, a lot has changed at the company — a spokesperson tells us most of the profits are going to the Holdfast Collective, which will spend it on protecting people and the environment. ""Patagonia’s new structure puts our environmental donations at a new, exponentially bigger level than with our previous ownership model did,"" they stated.

""Now that the Holdfast Collective gets our corporate dividend, rather than the Chouinard family, we are able to give significantly larger donations per year to environmental causes,"" they continued.

What new sustainable things can Patagonia fans expect to see?

In terms of new materials and products, the brand has some innovative pieces coming in spring 2023. Additionally, the spokesperson tells us both the brand's iconic Down Sweater and Micro Puff collections will be made with Bureo NetPlus fabric, which is derived from discarded fishing nets.

Those looking to stay active in cool conditions can get excited for the upcoming release of the men's Nano Air Light Hybrid Hoody, as well as the women's Cross Strata. Both act as warm-yet-lightweight layers for those trekking through high altitudes, in the woods, or through varying climates, using the most hi-tech design possible. They aren't available yet, but take a look at what you can expect to get in the photos, below.

Show Caption Hide Caption Patagonia founder gives company away to fight climate change Yvon Chouinard says he's giving away Patagonia, a $3 billion company, to help fight climate change. Buzz60, Buzz60

The billionaire founder of Patagonia has given his company away to help fight the climate crisis, according to a Wednesday announcement.

""While we’re doing our best to address the environmental crisis, it’s not enough. We needed to find a way to put more money into fighting the crisis,"" Yvon Chouinard, who started the outdoor apparel brand almost 50 years ago, wrote in a Wednesday letter. ""We can save our planet if we commit to it.""

Patagonia's website now reads, ""Earth is now our only shareholder.""

Chouinard and his family have transferred their ownership in the company, worth about $3 billion. Patagonia's new owners are environmental nonprofit the Holdfast Collective and the Patagonia Purpose Trust, created by Patagonia ""to protect the company's values.""

The Patagonia Purpose Trust owns all of the voting stock, or 2% of the company. That leaves the other 98% to the Holdfast Collective, who holds all of the nonvoting stock.

Patagonia itself will continue to be a for-profit business, a certified B Corp and a California benefit corporation. But every year, after first reinvesting in the company, all the money Patagonia makes will be given to Holdfast Collective to help fight the climate crisis, the company says.

The Holdfast Collective ""will use every dollar received to fight the environmental crisis, protect nature and biodiversity, and support thriving communities, as quickly as possible,"" Patagonia writes.

Expected contributions for these climate pursuits total to about $100 million each year, depending on how well the business is doing. According to The New York Times, Patagonia sells more than $1 billion in apparel annually.

The clothing company will also continue to donate 1% of annual sales to grassroots environmental nonprofits, in line with previous commitments the company has made in recent years.

Other options were to go public or sell the company and donate all the money, but neither felt like Patagonia's mission would be preserved with full certainty, Chouinard said.

""Truth be told, there were no good options available. So, we created our own,"" Chouinard wrote on Wednesday. ""Instead of 'going public,' you could say we’re 'going purpose' ... We’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth.""

Because Chouinard and his family transferred their ownership to a trust and a nonprofit, there will not be tax benefits, The New York Times reports. The family will pay about $17.5 million in taxes on the gift to Patagonia Purpose Trust. They also won't receive tax benefits on the shares they donated to Holdfast Collective – as the nonprofit is a 501(c)(4) and can make unlimited political contributions.

""They didn’t get a charitable deduction for it. There is no tax benefit here whatsoever,"" Dan Mosley, a partner at merchant bank BDT & Co. who helped Patagonia with the new ownership structure, told the Times.",['Wyatte Grantham-Philips'],2022-09-15 00:00:00
https://news.northeastern.edu/2022/09/20/patagonias-founder/,The founder of Patagonia gave away his company to fight climate change. Is that really as good as it sounds?,"Last week, Yvon Chouinard, founder of the multi-billion-dollar clothing brand Patagonia, announced he was doing something different with his company: giving it away.

Chouinard and his family transferred the entirety of their ownership of the company to both a newly designed trust and a newly created nonprofit. The Patagonia Purpose Trust will maintain the company’s “socially responsible business” approach, while the Holdfast Collective, a new nonprofit, will use company profits to fight climate change.

“We are going to give away the maximum amount of money to people who are actively working on saving this planet,” Chouinard told the New York Times.

Chouinard’s decision has been widely praised, especially at a time when the environmental impact of billionaires and corporations has never been clearer. Although there is reason to be optimistic, the real impact of the rock-climber-turned-billionaire’s decision is questionable, says Phil Brown, Northeastern University distinguished professor of sociology and health sciences.

Given Chouinard’s unique background in the world of business, the extent to which his decision will lead other companies to take a similarly proactive environmental approach is unclear.

“I think we need to have a lot more people with that level of money saying that climate change is the number one problem that we face,” Brown says. “Certainly because of [Chouinard’s] outdoors approach and appreciation it’s a logical fit. You’re not necessarily going to find a big furniture manufacturer having the same feelings. … At the highest levels the biggest companies are not usually going to be the ones that do the right thing.”

Even when a company does “the right thing,” it doesn’t mean that company is a beacon of ethical behavior in other areas. The prospect of ethical or responsible capitalism is dicey, at best, Brown says. In a sense, Patagonia is an outlier.

In recent years, Walmart has taken steps to increase sustainability among its suppliers and decrease the number of products with PFAS chemicals, also known as “forever chemicals.”

At the same time, the company has been repeatedly criticized for how it treats its workers.

“Look at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which supports a lot of really great research,” Brown says. But it’s money from Johnson & Johnson, which denied the cancer-causing effect of their talcum powder through decades. You’re always going to find some kind of disjunction between what the company does and the rest of its life.”

Some people have also cited the potential $1 billion in taxes that Chouinard and his family will avoid paying due to the structure of U.S. tax law. The Times reports that the Chouinards will have to pay $17.5 million in gift taxes for transferring their 2% voting stock to the trust. However, they won’t pay an estimated $700 million in capital gains taxes for the accrued value of the stocks. They also won’t pay anything on the other 98% of Patagonia shares they donated to the 501(c)(4) nonprofit they created.

Ted Clark, executive director of the Northeastern University Center for Family Business, says focusing on the family’s tax savings is “missing the forest through the trees.”

“Their intent was much bigger than tax savings,” Clark says. “They were going to have to work on saving taxes no matter what they did, so I look at the tax issue and say, that’s a structure of the law. They worked to minimize that, but they’re going to do some good for, hopefully, humanity.”

However, the decision to “give away” Patagonia could result in some “unintended consequences” for the business itself.

Clark says dividing ownership and management of the company between a trust, the beneficiaries of the nonprofit and existing executive staff could create potential conflict down the road.

“It could set up a dichotomy between the managers of the business and the nonprofit organizations that will be looking for dividends,” Clark says. “The motivation of these two groups could be very diametrically opposed.”

“As my grandmother said, ‘The road to hell is paved with good intentions,’” he adds. “There will probably be some unintended consequences between the new managers and the recipients of the profits and dividends. They’ll want more––they’ll always want more.”

It’s still unclear if the Patagonia news will be a bellwether for the future of corporate sustainability. Brown says the trend must start with public policy. Corporations are unlikely to change on their own, but large scale federal incentives like the Inflation Reduction Act can help move the needle. The legislation, which Congress approved last month, has been called the most significant piece of climate policy passed in U.S. history. It includes measures like clean energy tax credits, electric vehicle incentives, corporate methane fees and domestic clean energy manufacturing, all aimed at reducing carbon emissions by 40% by 2030.

“Instead of only saying ‘no’ to things, [the Inflation Reduction Act] says, ‘yes’ to lots of things,” Brown says. “We still need regulations, and we still need carbon taxes and other kinds of things. … But I think creating those incentives is very important.”

https://www.surfacemag.com/articles/yvon-chouinard-patagonia-climate-change/,Why Yvon Chouinard Gave Patagonia Back to the Earth – SURFACE,"In 2017, Forbes published an article that “really, really pissed off” Yvon Chouinard, the founder of popular outdoor clothing brand Patagonia. The article listed Chouinard as a billionaire, officially anointing him as one of the world’s richest people. Most businesspeople yearn for that level of success, but Chouinard—an eccentric mountain climber and self-described “existential dirtbag” from California’s Yosemite Valley—viewed it as a sign of personal failure. The descriptor might be harsh, but Chouinard has long prided himself on eschewing the gilded lifestyle espoused by most billionaires. He often ate five-cent cans of cat food to survive during his early adventures, when he lived out of his car, and today the octogenarian drives an old Subaru and doesn’t own a computer or cellphone.

Chouinard founded Patagonia nearly five decades ago as a climbing equipment startup to help finance his mountain adventures. (Originally named Chouinard Equipment, he changed the name to Patagonia after a transformative journey through the South American region with his best friend, Doug Tompkins, who went on to found rival brand The North Face.) Over time, Patagonia transformed into a purveyor of sturdy yet stylish outdoor apparel with the sole mission of making the world a better place. Ever-conscious of the company’s carbon footprint and the fashion industry’s rampant greenwashing, Patagonia took out a full-page ad in the New York Times on Black Friday that stated, bluntly, “Don’t Buy This Jacket.”

So it should come as no surprise that Chouinard has given Patagonia away. Rather than selling the company or taking it public, Chouinard and his family transferred their ownership to a specially designed trust and nonprofit, the Holdfast Collective, created to ensure that its profits combat climate change and protect undeveloped land. Patagonia will still operate as a private, for-profit corporation that sells $1 billion worth of ski pants and jackets per year, but the Chouinards are no longer the owners. “Hopefully this will influence a new form of capitalism that doesn’t end up with a few rich people and a bunch of poor people,” Chouinard told the Times. “We’re going to give away the maximum amount of money to people who are actively working on saving this planet.”",[],2022-09-19 04:09:54-04:00
https://businessmodelanalyst.com/patagonia-business-model/,Patagonia Business Model,"The Patagonia business model focuses on developing economic and social value through its products. Patagonia is a clothing retailer based in America. It specializes in manufacturing excellent-quality outdoor clothing before selling them directly to consumers or through distributors. Environmentalism and impact play a massive role in the Patagonia brand. While Patagonia’s clothing can be expensive, they repair them free of charge, giving customers value for their investment.

A brief history of Patagonia

Yvon Chouinard founded Patagonia in 1973. Yvon began his entrepreneurship journey in his parent’s backyard, where he made climbing equipment as a teenager. When Yvon and his friends embarked on big wall climbing activities in the 60s, in Yosemite, they imported nearly every piece of climbing equipment they used from Europe. What’s more, the metal spikes and pitons that climbers utilized to set up protection were made from poor-quality material. As a result, they weren’t durable and could only be used along shorter routes.

People embarking on long climbs needed to carry a huge supply to be on the safe side. Yvon invented a hard steel piton that climbers could use multiple times. Yvon would later partner with his friend, Tom Frost, a fellow climber, to launch Chouinard Equipment.

The two friends focused on redesigning and improving climbing tools for the next nine years. They were committed to developing simpler, lighter, robust and functional equipment. In 1970, five years after venturing into the entrepreneurship world, Chouinard Equipment was declared the biggest climbing hardware supplier in the United States. However, the brand’s equipment quickly became an environmental menace because it damaged the rock.

Yvon and Tom were forced to limit their piton business. They later introduced aluminum chocks two years later. According to Patagonia, the chocks could be “wedged by hand rather than hammered in and out of cracks.” The company penetrated the cloth manufacturing industry in 1972. The company’s inaugural items were: “bivouac sacks from Scotland, polyurethane rain cagoules, rugby shirts from England, reversible beanies from Boulder, boiled-wool mittens and gloves from Australia.”

The premier Patagonia store opened in 1973 in Ventura, California, where the company headquarters remain. Since its inception, Patagonia has provided its customers with different gear designed for sports like mountain biking, fly fishing, and surfing.

Who Owns Patagonia

Yvon Chouinard transferred Patagonia’s voting stock, equivalent to 2% of total shares in September 2022, to the Patagonia People Trust. Yvon’s advisors and family oversee the trust. Yvon and his family donated 98% of shares to Holdfast Collective, a newly launched nonprofit organization. The organization will receive all of Patagonia’s profits and use the funds to tackle climate change and secure the land.

Patagonia Mission Statement

Patagonia’s mission statement is to “Build the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, and use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis.”

How Patagonia works

Patagonia operates in adherence to the values initiated by its founders, as seen below.

Creating the Best Products

Patagonia’s approach to creating the best products relies on top-level durability, repairability, and function. The firm strives to build long-lasting or recyclable products to limit ecological effects. Patagonia believes that creating quality products is critical to saving the planet.

Causing Less Unnecessary Harm

Patagonia understands that its business activities, such as dyeing shirts and lighting stores, can harm the environment. As a result, they are committed to changing their business practices and discussing the lessons they’ve learned with the general public. Still, Patagonia believes in the power of eliminating harmful activities in pursuit of good practices.

Leveraging Business to Secure Nature

Patagonia understands that the challenges in the world today can only be solved with solid leadership. It’s committed to acting on problems promptly. The company embraces risk and works to protect and restore the digital industry’s beauty, integrity, and stability.

Not Enslaved by Agreements

Patagonia’s success is attributed to the company’s quest to develop new techniques for doing things.

How Patagonia makes money

While Patagonia generates revenue through manufacturing and selling clothing to customers, it enjoys massive brand equity. Still, the company discourages people from purchasing its clothing. Patagonia promotes fair trade, anti-consumerism, environmental stewardship, and charity. It actively demonstrates its commitment to building customer trust. Through these values, Patagonia makes money in the following ways.

Manufacturing Durable Clothing

Patagonia sells some of the best quality and durable clothing to its consumers. Unlike many clothes companies today, Patagonia doesn’t rely on the planned obsolescence approach. The company runs Worn Wear events in various parts of the U.S., where they repair their consumer’s old clothing. Such events help strengthen the bond between the company and its target customers while demonstrating its commitment to warranties.

Marketing and Advertising

Patagonia’s advertising campaigns are designed to convince customers to purchase less clothing. The company says, “We design and sell things made to last and be useful. But we ask our customers not to buy from us what they don’t need or can’t really use. Everything we make — everything anyone makes — costs the planet more than it gives back.” Still, the “Don’t Buy This Jacket” campaign preaches the irrelevance of sales while encouraging consumers to make thoughtful purchases.

Patagonia Competitors

Columbia Sportswear: Founded in 1938 and headquartered in Portland, Oregon, the United States, Columbia Sportswear is one of the top brands in the outdoor clothing industry. The company started its operations by selling hats before incorporating other clothing items. Today, Columbia Sportswear sells more than 5,000 different styles to its consumers globally. The company went public in 1998, raising approximately $100 million. Currently, it’s valued at around $6 billion;

The North Face: The company was founded by Douglas and Susie Tompkins, a couple, in 1968. It has its headquarters in Alameda, California, USA. The North Face is renowned for some of its iconic outdoor clothing designs. Some of its notable products popular with professional mountaineers include the mountain jacket and base camp duffle. The couple would later sell the company in 1970 to Kenneth “Hap” Klopp, who later sold it to V.F. Corporation in 2000 for $25.4 million;

Canada Goose: Laurie Skreslet wore Canada Goose’s famous jacket to make history as the first Canadian to summit Mt. Everest. Sam Tick founded the company in 1957.

Salomon: Georges Salomon founded the company in 1947 in Épagny-Metz-Tessy, France. The company’s ski binders helped it carve a name for itself in the outdoor industry. So popular were its products that they would become a household name in the mid-1970s. Salomon later incorporated alpine boots into their brand, releasing its inaugural clothing line in 2001, marking its entrance into the fashion industry. Adidas purchased Salomon in 1997 before selling it off to Amer Sports in 2005 for €485 million. Today, the company has retail stores worldwide and employs approximately 3,000 people. In 2018, Amer Sports was sold to Anta Sports, triggering its delisting from Salomon.

https://www.aspentimes.com/news/patagonias-pitch-for-the-planet/,Patagonia’s pitch for the planet: CEO transfers ownership to combat climate change,"""The earth is our main shareholder,"" according to Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard's press release.

Screenshot from Patagonia.com

Long before you could buy your Patagonia apparel and gear at the Snowmass Village Mall, company founder Yvon Chouinard was an avid rock climber and mountain man living in California.

He made his start by crafting durable gear for he and his friend’s outdoor adventures.

Chouinard wanted to cultivate an outdoor brand that strived to do less harm to the environment than traditional brands.

“I never wanted to be a businessman,” he said in a release from Patagonia. “I started as a craftsman, making climbing gear for my friends and myself, then got into apparel.”

With the brand now valued at $3 billion, Chouinard and his family transferred ownership to a special trust and nonprofit organization dedicated to combating climate change, The New York Times first reported .





The newly established organization, Holdfast Collective, will now receive 98% of the companies profits, an estimated $100 million a year, according to The New York Times. The money from the organization will be funneled into nonprofit environmental groups and political organizations.

The other 2% — all of the company’s voting stock — will go to the newly established Patagonia Purpose Trust. The trust was created so the Chouinard family and advisers can oversee operations, making sure the brand continues its commitments to social and environmental welfare.

Shades of green

Prior to this initiative, Patagonia reportedly donated 1% of profits every year to climate change organizations.

According to a McKinsey Sustainability report from 2021 , less than 1% of philanthropic donations in the United States goes to environmental nonprofits, making Patagonia’s recent initiative all the more groundbreaking.

Still, the fashion industry is said to be one of the most polluting industries in the world, trailing the oil and gas industry.

Patagonia may not fully claim they are a “fashion” business, but they still produce new apparel every year. While companies can do their best to mitigate the impacts they have on the environment, there’s no way to be fully sustainable when producing new items of anything.

The fashion industry is responsible for an estimated 3% of global carbon emissions, emitting more than 850 million tons of carbon per year, according to a 2017 study published in Semantic Scholar.

However, unlike many brands that tout their environmental efforts, Patagonia isn’t afraid to admit their business does have a negative impact on the planet.

The brand ran an ad in The New York Times on Black Friday stating, “Don’t Buy This Jacket.”

Patagonia’s “Don’t Buy This Jacket” ad on Black Friday in The New York Times.

Screen Shot from Patagonia.com

In response to the ad, the brand said, “Each piece of Patagonia clothing, whether or not it’s organic or uses recycled materials, emits several times its weight in greenhouse gases, generates at least another half garment’s worth of scrap and draws down copious amounts of freshwater now growing scarce everywhere on the planet.”

New capitalism

Chouinard has bold intentions with giving away his company. He told The New York Times in an exclusive interview that he hopes his company will inspire “a new form of capitalism that doesn’t end up with a few rich people and a bunch of poor people.”

In typical succession fashion, the company could have been passed down to his children, but they reportedly didn’t want it.

Ryan Gellert, Patagonia’s chief executive officer, told The New York Times that the children “embody this notion that every billionaire is a policy failure.”

While Patagonia’s efforts have been applauded by many, the intention has been met with skepticism as well, with some saying they think this could be just a typical tax ploy.

According to Grist , the company paid $17.5 million in taxes on their donations, which was a small percentage of the money funneled in. The 501(c)(4) organization receiving Patagonia’s profits will be considered tax-exempt by the IRS. This is murky, considering the trust still allows the Chouinards to oversee all operations.

Others have noted that Patagonia’s recent move isn’t all that new. Prior to this, billionaire Barre Seid donated $1.6 billion to a conservative nonprofit organization, The New York Times reported in August .

Therefore, this “new form of capitalism” could be under the guise of good-hearted philanthropy but could further the trend of the ultra-wealthy buying more political power than before.

Aspen’s 100

This news comes at a contentious time for income inequality.

Aspen and the Roaring Fork Valley have felt the effects of the ultra-wealthy, and roughly 100 billionaires can call the area home, or second home.

“Basalt has been Aspenized,” Denise Drake told Elizabeth Key in an opinion piece published by The Aspen Times in August. “The billionaires pushed the millionaires to Basalt.”

A question is how many may follow Chouinard’s new form of capitalism —and even whether that would be a good thing.

https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/postcard-from-patagonia-my-trip-to-torres-del-paine-chile-in-photos,Patagonia: My trip to Torres del Paine in pictures,"California-based photographer Evan Ruderman recently returned from his second trip to Chile’s epic Torres del Paine national park. Here, he shares some shots and tips that got him through his 10-day trek.

I first explored Torres del Paine, Chile in 2018 on a brief two-day trip – and left wanting more. Though I rarely revisit places – there’s just too much to see in this world! – as I traveled home I promised myself I would one day return to see more of this magnificent park.

As a travel photographer, I knew it was only a matter of time until I could find a way for “work” to bring me back. A few months ago, the stars aligned when my brother mentioned backpacking through the park during his time in between jobs – and I excitedly volunteered to join.

Make the most out of every adventure with help from our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.

We elected to do the O Trek, a world-renowned backpacking route that loops around the famous Patagonian park. While many people opt for the popular four-day W-Trek, the O Trek is the eight-to-10-day, lengthier (85 mile) and more immersive option, and it’s far less traveled. We packed our bags and were soon to find out why Lonely Planet ranks it as one of the 10 best treks in the world.

Evan's campsite in Torres del Paine © Evan Ruderman

In Torres del Paine, I stayed in...

A tent! Yet since there are multiple accommodation options in the park, figuring out where to stay was the most difficult part of planning this trip. Along the trek there are evenly spaced refugios – think hostels in the wilderness – that welcome guests. For a premium ($125 per person), you can stay inside, in dorm-style rooms but a more budget-friendly option ($25 per person) lets you pitch a tent and sleep outside in the campsite area.

Even if you stay in the campsite, you still have access the refugios’ facilities which include bathrooms, hot showers, wi-fi (for about $8 an hour), outlets for charging and cooking areas with tables and sinks.

Some of the refugios also have snack bars where you can purchase supplies like candy bars, cookies, ramen, chips and even cold beers, and a few sell more substantial food like pizza and hamburgers. Inside or outside, all of them come with five-star views, and the infrastructure makes this backpacking experience a lot easier than being entirely in the wilderness.

Coffee and an easy camping breakfast in Torres del Paine © Evan Ruderman

I start the day in the Torres del Paine with…

Coffee and an easy camping breakfast. We packed in all of our own supplies, and each campsite along the route had designated areas and tables – both indoor and outdoor – for cooking, which was quite nice. These designated areas are the only places in which stove use is allowed in the park: it’s illegal to use camping stoves anywhere else in an effort to prevent wildfires.

Each morning of this trek involved rolling out of bed, breaking down our tents and sleeping setups, and boiling water for coffee and oatmeal. Then we would start a long day of hiking.

The famous 'towers' at sunrise © Evan Ruderman

In Torres del Paine you must try...

Hiking to the famous Towers at sunrise. The crown jewels of the park are the three distinctive granite peaks of the Paine mountain range (exactly what the park is named after – “torres” means “towers” in Spanish). If you’ve seen photos of the park, you’ve likely come across this iconic view, and it’s a must-see while there.

It certainly isn’t easy, and getting there for sunrise meant waking up at 1am and completing a pretty strenuous hike on the final morning of our long trek. But it was without question worth it. The view of these jagged peaks nestled above a sparkling glacial lake is unlike anything I had ever seen, and was a perfect way to cap off the trip.

Planning tip: Be sure to dress warm and charge your headlamp before you set out.

Crossing the suspension bridge © Evan Ruderman

The top spot for an epic adventure in Torres del Paine is…

The suspension bridges near Glacier Grey. On day four or five (depending on your pace) you’ll go over John Gardner Pass, earning breathtaking views of Glacier Grey from above before continuing to hike alongside it for miles.

On this portion of the trek, you’ll cross a series of suspension bridges that are sure to get your heart rate up. The bridges hang high over the valleys below and sway side to side as you walk – offering sweeping views of the landscapes and making the day feel quite adventurous. Remember to go one at a time over these long bridges to minimize swaying.

A good pair of trekking poles will come in handy © Evan Ruderman

The one item I recommend bringing to Torres del Paine is...

A good pair of trekking poles. Many backpackers think trekking poles are optional or only for those who specifically need them, yet in my years of backpacking experience I have come to learn that trekking poles are absolutely essential for anyone and everyone. The days on the O Trek are long, many covering 10+ miles with a lot of vertical gain and loss. Trekking poles help you significantly both on the way up and on the way down, taking some of the load off of your knees and legs while also giving you extra points of contact to avoid slipping and falling or rolling an ankle. I used a pair from Black Diamond; just about any pair will do.

Planning tip: If you don’t own poles or want to avoid the hassle of traveling with them, there are plenty of places in Puerto Natales (the nearest town to the park) to rent a pair for just a few dollars a day.",[],
https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/patagonia-founder-gives-company-away-ensuring-profits-go-fight-climate-rcna47793,"Patagonia founder gives away company, ensuring profits go to fight climate change","The founder of the outdoor brand Patagonia has relinquished his ownership in the business and directed its profits to fight climate change.

Yvon Chouinard, who became famous for alpine climbs in Yosemite National Park and then as a manufacturer of outdoor gear, has transferred his family's ownership of Patagonia to two new entities, one of them a nonprofit organization that will use the businesses' annual profits to fight climate change, the company said in a news release Wednesday.

""Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth, we are using the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source. We’re making Earth our only shareholder,"" Chouinard, 83, said in the statement.

In a letter to customers, Chouinard said Patagonia is now owned by a trust that will determine the company's direction and a new nonprofit group called the Holdfast Collective, which is dedicated to protecting nature and other environmental causes.

The company's leadership has not changed.

""While we’re doing our best to address the environmental crisis, it’s not enough,"" Chouinard wrote. ""... Each year the money we make after reinvesting in the business will be distributed as a dividend to help fight the crisis.""

The company expects to contribute roughly $100 million to the Holdfast Collective through an annual dividend depending on the businesses' success.

In a question-and-answer section appended to Chouinard's letter, the company said Patagonia continues to be a for-profit business as a certified B Corp, a designation for companies that consider factors such as social and environmental impacts of their businesses.

It also said that the Chouinard family will continue to ""guide the Patagonia Purpose Trust, electing and overseeing its leadership"" and sit on Patagonia's board. The company ""will keep doing its best to be a great employer.""

Denis Hayes, who coordinated the first Earth Day and later became the CEO of the environmentally focused Bullitt Foundation in Seattle, said Chouinard has long been a strident environmentalist willing to make bold moves and challenge convention. The Patagonia brand, Hayes noted, charges a premium, in part, because of the values it represents.

""Apparently, they’re putting it into the structure that will institutionalize that beyond his lifetime,"" said Hayes, whose foundation operates a for-profit building it claims is the greenest in the world.

Hayes said businesses in manufacturing or extractive industries in a capitalist economy that requires growth ultimately run into conflicts with environmental and climate values.

""The concept of putting this together in a new structure and being experimental and bold is exactly the kind of innovation we need to be trying,"" Hayes said.

Chouinard started selling climbing equipment such as pitons in 1957, usually out of his car.

Later, Chouinard became an advocate of so-called ""clean climbing,"" in which protective gear is placed and removed in rock walls so it does not cause damage from hammering pitons.

He holds several patents, including one for aluminum climbing chocks designed to cause less destruction of rock.","['Evan Bush', 'Evan Bush Is A Science Reporter For Nbc News. He Can Be Reached At Evan.Bush Nbcuni.Com.']",
https://matadornetwork.com/read/patagonia-rain-jackets/,We Tested Patagonia Rain Jackets in the Real World and These Are the 6 Best,"Few items describe themselves so perfectly as a rainjacket. We know exactly what we’re getting. Or, so we thought — until the 1980s, when the innovative geniuses working in product development at Patagonia decided to revolutionize the practice of keeping outdoorspeople dry in wet conditions. Its first fleece jacket hit shelves in 1985, followed eight years later by its first fleece jacket made of recycled bottles (for context, it wasn’t until the 2010s that clothing made of plastic bottles hit the mainstream). Between then and now, Patagonia has released dozens of rain jacket concepts. Some are geared towards expedition use while others are simpler, intended for daily wear during a routine afternoon storm. Matador decided to put the brand’s rainjackets to the test to determine which is best for what outdoor activity. The results of our deep dives lie below, penned by hands (and minds) as dry as Jair Bolsonaro’s heart.

We hope you love the Patagonia ran jackets we recommend! Just so you know, Matador may collect a small commission from the links on this page if you decide to make a purchase.

The best three-season Patagonia rain jacket: Granite Crest

The good: Classic look, adjustable hem and hood, underarm vents, kept me dry in heavy rain, made with recycled materials

The bad: A bit pricey, thin fabric may be more prone to rips and tears (but there’s a repair program)

The Granite Crest Rain Jacket from Patagonia has everything I want in a three-season rain jacket I can wear year after year and for all kinds of activities. Basically, that means it’s not overengineered or overdesigned. It’s a solid-color jacket with a straight cut and features you need, but doesn’t have a bunch of bells and whistles to weigh it down or drive up the price. It’s a super waterproof, super lightweight jacket, and a classic design that’ll be just as stylish 10 years from now as it is today.

The most important factor in deciding which Patagonia rain jacket to buy should obviously be how well it protects agains rain, and I put the Granite Crest Jacket through some serious testing.

And rest assured: it’s very, very waterproof. Most waterproof materials (like GORE-TEX) use a rating system between 0K and 20K. A zero rating means it’s not at all waterproof, and 5K means it’s suitable in conditions where rain won’t be pounding against the fabric, like in snowfall or light rain and mist. A 5-10K rating is usually good for light rain, and 10-15K is good for pretty heavy rains. A 20K rating is only needed in heavy, relentless rainfall — the type of storm where it feels like someone dumped a bucket on your head.

Patagonia uses a proprietary technology called H2No®, and it doesn’t publish ratings like other waterproof fabrics do. But Patagonia does test their fabrics to mimic 30 years of use — and the materials have to still maintain a 10K rating after that test is finished. So it’s safe to say it’s going to keep you dry.

I wore it paddling and backpacking in pouring rain in Alaska and rocked it while mountain biking in rain at Whistler Mountain Resort’s world-famous mountain bike park. I also wore it during everyday tasks like walking my dog or running errands. And even during an Alaska summer deluge, my clothing underneath stayed dry, even after a few hours of hiking.

I did notice that the outer layer of the jacket seemed wet, and I thought to myself that my layer underneath would definitely be soaked — but nope. All that was wet under my jacket was around my wrists, where I had forgotten to tighten the Granite Crest Jacket’s cuffs. I don’t know how this H2No technology works, but it did an excellent job of keeping rain limited to the top layer of my jacket, which is exactly what a rain jacket should do.

I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this jacket to any of my friends. The sizing seems fairly standard: I’m 5’7″ and wearing a size small with a few layers underneath in most of these photos. -Suzie Dundas

The best Patagonia rain jacket for trail running and backpacking: Storm Racer Pullover

The good: For being lightweight and thin, this jacket is burly. With the zippers and waist tightened, the jacket protects your head and entire upper torso — meaning you won’t get wet, even if, as Forrest Gump described in so much detail, you encounter big ol’ fat rain, rain that flies in sideways, or rain that comes straight up from underneath.

The bad: The jacket feels awkward, at best. Fully zipped, it encases the head with so much precision that you may feel that you’re wearing a space suit. It also looks semi-ridiculous, but fortunately, the outdoors community isn’t gunning for fashion prizes.

Initially, I didn’t know what to do with the Patagonia Storm Racer Pullover. The first time I wore it was on a day hike during a light afternoon rain shower, the kind that reliably hits the Colorado high country on summer afternoons at about 3:00 and moves on by 3:20. It kept me dry, for sure — to the point that it seemed like overkill. I was with my wife, and during the 30 minutes I had it on, she commented no less than four times about how ridiculous I looked.

Its next use came during a morning dog walk on a day that promised nothing but solid rain from start to finish. The Storm Racer fit the bill more appropriately this time, as the raindrops were big and heavy and the only word that could be used to describe my surroundings was, “wet.” The jacket again kept me dry. I again felt out of place, however, as though I were a bright blue jelly bean from a nether world maneuvering my way through a local park as lost as a, well, puppy.

It was as I sat to take notes on my two initial experiences with the Storm Racer Pullover that it hit me. This jacket should live in my backpacking pack. That’s where it belongs — among hardy gear that is great to have when you’re in the backcountry and unpredictable weather hits, but that is out of place among the afternoon hiking setup. This is a piece that, when 10 miles from the trailhead, just when you think all hope for an enjoyable endeavor is being carried back down the trail by rapidly-intensifying rainfall, you remember that you have tucked in the bottom of the pack and think, “Oh, hell yes. You’ve knocked me down but not out, rain, and I’m going to enjoy this night at camp or this run down the trail even despite you.”

I’ve since tested the Storm Racer on such occasions and have reliably been glad I had it with me. On the spec side, the Storm Racer Pullover is built for trail running and backpacking. It fits underneath an outer layer but doesn’t have to be worn that way. It compacts into its own sack to sit in your pack until called upon (as noted above). The underarms are ventilated, for when it’s raining but not cold, and you can either rock the chest zippers all the way up over your chin like a nylon balaclava or unzip it slightly to allow for more air circulation around the neck and shoulders.

It fits and looks best when worn with other waterproof gear (a blatant mistake I made was lacking such gear on my initial hike with the Storm Racer). Waterproof pants/shorts and camp hats, for example, pair well with this piece. It’s also built to zip over a double water bottle holder on the chest, making it ideal for long runs. It’s made of 100 percent recycled nylon and is Fair Trade Certified, with Patagonia’s trademark H2NO technology keeping you dry. -Tim Wenger

The best insulated Patagonia rain jacket: Off-Slope Jacket

The good: Doesn’t look like a ski jacket, insulated, big pockets, cinchable waist, fabric made from recycled fishing nets, collar separate from hood

The bad: Snug around the shoulders, a bit stiff/bulky at first, expensive

It may seem like ski jackets and winter rain jackets would be the same, but they’re actually quite different — you don’t need your winter rain jacket to look like you just finished a half-pipe lap. That is to say: it doesn’t need to be brightly colored and covered in oversized pockets.

Patagonia knows that, and they created a waterproof jacket made for rainy winter wear — not on-the-slopes wear. In fact, it’s called the “Off Slope Jacket.” It’s a Patagonia rain jacket with thick insulation for winter wear, made with a two-layer H2No® material. It’s probably not quite as suited to heavy downpours as the Granite Crest Jacket recommended above, but few jackets are. I wore this one on rainy, cold evenings in British Columbia and stayed quite dry during extended walks. So it’ll definitely keep you dry in heavy snow and at least moderate, ongoing rain showers.

One of the features I liked best about this Patagonia rain jacket is the drawcord waist. It not only adds a bit of style (and is rather flattering, as compared to most insulated jackets), but it also makes it quite a bit warmer. I’m wearing a small, and it’s plenty roomy in the body — but tightening the drawcord cuts down on the amount of cold air between my body and the jacket.

I also particularly liked the design of the hood, which hangs separately from the collar. So you can zip the collar all the way up for extra warmth around your neck even if you don’t want the hood fully on.

Of the many Patagonia rain jackets I’ve tested, the Off Slope Jacket is the only one where the sizing hasn’t been perfect. I’m 5’7″ and wear a size small, but I have a tall torso and broad shoulders. I found that I could have used an extra inch or so across the back shoulders, and an extra inch or two of circumference around the armpit holes. It feels a bit snug around my shoulders when I’m wearing a thicker shirt underneath. However, I think this is truly because I’m on the taller and slimmer side and have big shoulders — unless you meet all those criteria, it’ll probably fit well. And if you do meet those criteria, consider sizing up, but just know it’ll be a bit roomy in the body (as shown the photos above). -Suzie Dundas

The best Patagonia ran jacket for everyday use: The Torrentshell

The good: The Patagonia Torrentshell rain jacket is a daily driver that can be used for just about any activity. It fits tight, looks smooth, and Patagonia’s H2NO technology protects from the wet elements with precision.

The bad: There isn’t much negative to say about the Patagonia Torrentshell jacket. My only complaint is that when not zipped up entirely, the right front chest column tends to fold over (see photo below).

Truth be told, I bought the Patagonia Torrentshell jacket not because of its specs, or because of the reviews of prior users. I didn’t even buy it because I trusted the brand — at the time of purchase, I’d never owned anything from Patagonia before. As an early-career journalist who prioritized beer money over brand-name gear, the stuff was simply too expensive. What finally pushed me over the edge was Patagonia’s unabashed and unapologetic environmentalism. I wanted to be a part of it. So, about a decade ago, I threw down just over a bill for a Torrentshell because I needed a new rain jacket. Since that day, I’ve become as unabashed in my support of the brand as it is in its support of the planet.

Here’s why: I’ve worn this jacket hundreds of times. It’s been with me on international story assignments, multi-day backpacking trips, late-spring splitboarding expeditions, and more dog walks and day hikes than I could count. Through it all, its DWR and sustainable nylon have kept me dry and protected from the wind. The jacket still looks unworn, like it’s broken in but not beat up, unlike the cheaper gear I’d become used to as a teenager and early 20-something. After some 10 years of solid use, I’m confident the jacket has at least as many years left in it. From spring through fall, I keep the Torrentshell jacket rolled up in my day pack, where it’s reliably called upon to keep my plans on track without having to re-adjust due to impending weather.

The hood works best when the jacket is fully zipped. This keeps your head encased inside so that your hair (or in my case, scalp) don’t get wet. The bottom cut on a Torrentshell that’s appropriately sized for its wearer hovers just below the belt, making it as fashionable as it is functional. No one likes to feel like they’re wearing a poncho, after all.

The bottom line is this: If you need a dependable rain jacket that is versatile, durable, and worth every penny, the Patagonia Torrentshell is that jacket. –Tim Wenger

The best Patagonia rain jacket for mountain biking: Dirt Roamer Jacket

The good: Bike-specific design, big back pocket, Fair-Trade, breathable, stretchy, waterproof, dropped back hem

The bad: No listed waterproof rating, lack of front pockets is a bit annoying for wear off the saddle, small zipper pulls

Most people serious enough about mountain biking that they’d buy an expensive jacket just for mountain biking in the rain probably already know what features they want and which are a waste of (fabric) space.

Fortunately, the Dirt Roamer rain jacket from Patagonia seems like it was designed by people who live for brown pow days.

The slim-fit jacket is extremely lightweight but very windproof, which is exactly what mountain bikers need when they’re sweating on the uphill and know they’re going to get cold at higher speeds on the way down. It’s small enough to roll up and store on the external straps of my hip pack, something I can’t do with bulkier or more rigid waterproof jackets. It also has more fitted elastic cuffs so the sleeves don’t bunch up your arms when you’re sending it, and the brimmed hood is thin enough to just fold it up and tuck it inside. And the dropped back him keeps your low back covered when you’re in downhill mode.

The dirt roamer has a large low back pocket as you’d find on most mountain and road biking bibs, and the hood adjusts with one hand so you don’t have to take your hands off the bars. The slim fit won’t add any drag or get hooked on any rogue tree branches, and the soft, breathable material adds waterproof protection without adding heat — it feels like riding in a thick T-shirt, rather than a plasticky jacket. The most noticeable thing I didn’t like were the zipper pulls, which are a bit hard to grab while wearing gloves.

As with all Patagonia rain jackets, there’s no listed waterproofing rating, but I’ve worn it in the heaviest rain you’d want to mountain biking in (constant rain that alternates between light and moderate) and I’ve stayed dry. It’s basically a super-light windbreaker that feels like a softshell jacket, but with the dryness of a rain jacket.

Though it’s quite stretchy, you may want to size up if you don’t like slim fits or have broader, larger shoulder. -Suzie Dundas

The best Patagonia rain jacket for cardio activities in cold weather: the Storm Shift Jacket

The good: Extremely waterproof and windproof, thin and light yet surprisingly warm, numerous pockets strategically placed for ease of use, versatile for most activities and seasons, easily packable.

The bad: Long in the arms no matter the size, choices of color are very limited, pricey.

Although meant for skiers and boarders, the Storm Shift Jacket works for every outdoor activity and in most seasons. Yes, it has all the features you need if you spend a lot of time playing in the snow, like a Gore-Tex outer layer that is super waterproof, a high collar to keep the wind off your face, a large hood to fit over your helmet (the hood also has a RECCO reflector that emits a radar signal which makes you findable by professional rescuers), a snow skirt with a solid rubber seal, pit zips for ventilation, and multiple pockets for your ski pass, gloves, hat, phone, wallet, etc. But many of those features can be used when the hill is closed, and despite all the bells and whistles, this Patagonia jacket has a classic look that works just as well on the streets as it does on the slopes.

I’ve used my Patagonia Storm Shift Jacket every day since early November even though my local ski hill hasn’t opened yet. I’ve been wearing it for biking, hiking, and walking, since the weather shifted to rain, wind, and later snow and freezing temperature in early November. The Gore-Tex exterior, the large hood, and the high collar have been keeping me dry and warm while I walk the 40 minutes needed to get downtown daily and in any type of weather. The snow skirt is very discreet and you don’t notice it’s there at all when you don’t use it. The multiple pockets are practical for carrying all your essentials, such as your phone, keys, tissues, hat, and gloves.

There are multiple practical pockets on the Storm Shift Jacket. Photo: Jesse Adams The Stom Shift Jacket is fitted with a RECCO system located in the hood. Photo: Jesse Adams

But what makes this Patagonia jacket truly versatile is how thin and light it is for a ski jacket. The unusual gray zigzag liner keeps the jacket super slim, making it easily packable (just fold and roll to fit it in your luggage). My previous ski jacket, a Bench model in a similar but nicer color combination and in the same medium size, has a thick fleece liner that made it very bulky in comparison. While I could not wear thick sweaters under my Bench jacket, it’s not an issue with Patagonia’s Storm Shift. And don’t be fooled: a thinner liner does not mean that it’s not as warm — the Storm Shift Jacket keeps you toasty in below-zero temperatures, just like it’s meant to.

Despite being an excellent jacket, the Storm Shift has two downsides. For one, the arms are a little too long and lack the inner cuffs with thumb holes that prevent the wind from blowing in. There is a velcro system that helps tighten the end of the sleeves, however. Second, there are only four colors available for the women’s Storm Shift Jacket and three of them are plain boring (gray, brown, and muted blue). I chose the Fresh Teal model, the brightest on offer, but it’s a little too 90s fashion to my taste.

Because it’s so easy to pack and so waterproof, I’d argue that you should use this Patagonia jacket in every season, whether you’re hiking in the chilly alpine in the spring or late summer, biking in the rain in the fall, skiing or boarding in winter, or just plain walking when it’s wet and windy. For me, it’s an all-in-one jacket and it’s now the only one I own. After all, with a price tag of $479, it should be versatile. — Morgane Croissant

https://foodtank.com/news/2022/10/patagonia-founder-gives-company-away-to-fight-the-climate-crisis/,Patagonia Founder Gives Company Away to Fight the Climate Crisis – Food Tank,"Patagonia Founder Yvon Chouinard and his family recently announced that they are giving away their outdoor clothing and gear company to help fight the climate crisis.

“It’s been a half-century since we began our experiment in responsible business. If we have any hope of a thriving planet 50 years from now, it demands all of us doing all we can with the resources we have,” Chouinard says in a press release.

The Chouinard family will transfer ownership to Patagonia Purpose Trust and the Holdfast Collective. The Patagonia Purpose Trust was created to protect the company’s values and missions. Holding the voting stock of the company, it has the right to approve key decisions for the company’s future.

The Holdfast Collective is a nonprofit organization that fights to protect the environment and will ensure the company’s profits go toward this goal. Each year, Patagonia reports that the funds that are not re-invested into the company will help to protect biodiversity and communities.

“Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth,” Chouinard writes in a letter on the Trust’s website.

While the decision means that Patagonia will avoid paying millions in taxes, Patagonia CEO Ryan Gellert says that this is not the family’s intention.

“Two years ago, the Chouinard family challenged a few of us to develop a new structure with two central goals. They wanted us to both protect the purpose of the business and immediately and perpetually release more funding to fight the environmental crisis,” says Gellert. “We believe this new structure delivers on both and we hope it will inspire a new way of doing business that puts people and planet first.”

Instead of selling Patagonia and donating the profit to charity, or taking the company public, Chouinard has given the $3-billion outdoor fashion brand to a trust and a nonprofit organization, called the Holdfast Collective.

The goal, says Chouinard, is to put any profit not reinvested into the company towards fighting climate change. He claims that will amount to about $100 million per year, depending on how well the company performs.

Here’s how Patagonia’s stock will be divided up:



What is the Holdfast Collective?

While Patagonia will continue to operate as a for-profit company, its excess profits, whatever is left after reinvesting in the business, will go to a newly formed organization called the Holdfast Collective. The Chouinards donated 98% of Patagonia to this collective.

Here’s how it will operate:

📢 It will advocate for causes.

💰 It will make grants and investments “to fight the environmental crisis, protect nature and biodiversity, and support thriving communities.”

All of the collective’s shares will all be nonvoting, which means it will have no input on how Patagonia is run.

What is the Patagonia Purpose Trust?

Last month, the Chouinard family transferred all of the company’s voting stock into the newly established Patagonia Purpose Trust. Family members and their advisors will oversee the trust, which will ensure the company continues its focus on social responsibility. Unlike the Holdfast Collective, the trust will have decision-making power over the company.

https://www.elon.edu/u/news/2023/02/08/alumni-in-action-a-peak-into-carrie-hartsfield-macleans-16-life-in-patagonia/,Alumni in Action: A ‘peak’ into Carrie Hartsfield MacLean’s ’16 life in Patagonia,"Elon alumni rise to the challenge every day in many ways, but MacLean is reaching new heights, quite literally with her travel agency, Venture Patagonia, based in Puerto Natales, Chile that prides itself on cultural immersion and life-changing experiences.

Carrie Hartsfield MacLean ‘16 attended Elon University after learning about the school from a friend. She ended up visiting campus before applying and that was all that it took for her to fall in love with the university.

She applied early decision because she knew from the start that Elon was the right place for her. As an undergraduate, she majored in sport and event management and minored in both business administration and Spanish. She was also very involved on campus, serving on Elonthon’s executive committee, Elon’s largest student-run philanthropic event that benefits Duke Children’s Hospital. She also dedicated a lot of her time to Greek life as a member of Alpha Omicron Pi and served as their philanthropy chair.

Following graduation, it was not long before MacLean made her move to Patagonia. Initially, as a graduate, she worked for half a year with a destination management company she interned with as an undergraduate called Capitol Services, Inc. She decided early on that learning Spanish would be crucial to her excelling in the event industry, and out of a desire to become more fluent, she felt that immersion was the best way to make that happen.

“I originally moved to Chile with the intention of improving my Spanish for six months then moving back to the U.S. and jumping back into the destination management career. I sincerely had no hesitations, I knew if it didn’t work out I had enough money saved to find something else to do and return to the U.S.,” said MacLean.

She chose Chile as her destination of choice because they have a stable government and more of the infrastructure that she was accustomed to, and she felt that it would be an easier transition to accomplish her goal of learning Spanish.

After being there only a short while, she fell in love with Patagonia and decided to stay. In March 2017, just ten months after graduation from Elon, she started her own travel agency called, Venture Patagonia.

“We are based in Puerto Natales and organize personalized all-inclusive trips throughout Chile, Argentina, Patagonia, Antarctica and Easter Island. I wanted to give my guests the freedom to stay at the best, most unique accommodations, travel in private vehicles with a private driver, pick and choose their own excursions, and go to places more remote and culturally deeper than most tourists can go,” explained MacLean.



Starting a business in another country was no small task though, especially because she had to make it happen by utilizing a second language. She explained though that she always had a “can do” attitude and mindset, believing that she could do anything she set her mind to.

“It took me around two months from my decision to start my business to open. This included beginning the operations office in Chile and the sales office in the United States, setting up a bank account, creating a logo and defining the company name, designing the website, starting social media accounts, itinerary planning, marketing plans, financial goals, accounting and more,” explained MacLean.

When asked about the most challenging part of building her company, she said it was building a great team to work alongside. This is something that just takes time, she said, but is important. In the end, she feels it is her amazing team that defines the quality of their services because they help her to accomplish her goals day in, day out.

When she first started the business, MacLean was living in Chile for most of the year but was returning back to the U.S. as well. She said that the transition to Chile as her home was gradual.

The first two years she was living in Patagonia for a little over half of the year and then she would go back to the United States for the “off-season,” which for her was May through September. During this time in the U.S., she would visit family and friends while also working for her business by making online reservations for the following season.

“When I returned to Puerto Natales my third year, there was a notable change. I felt like I was returning home after a vacation and that was the life-changing moment when I decided this was my place,” said MacLean.

She began looking for her own land to purchase to build a new home there, and shortly thereafter she met her husband who is a fifth-generation Patagonian rancher that has lived in Puerto Natales his whole life. He ultimately introduced her to the ranching culture. MacLean said that she now loves riding horses and helping on the ranch; they also have three children together. “I never expected I would be running my own company, married and raising a family in another country, but where I am now is infinitely better than any life I ever envisioned for myself,” said MacLean.

MacLean’s primary goal for her company is to help travelers gain a cultural perspective from their travels. “Most people, myself included, fall in love with the idea of traveling to a place from pictures we have seen of the landscapes or cute cities. It’s easy to plan a trip solely based on the landscapes, but what I always remember from a place is the culture, the people I met, the experiences I had. Those experiences should be authentic and enriching,” said MacLean. This is what is at the heart of her company, and what she feels sets it apart from other travel companies.

Her favorite part of her business is meeting with each guest and helping them find transformational experiences. She loves to speak with guests after their trip to hear all about their time with Venture Patagonia and how it has changed their life. She’s even had the pleasure of traveling alongside fellow Elon graduates as they explored Patagonia for the first time through booking with her company, allowing her time at Elon to come full circle.

MacLean credits Elon for preparing her well for the difficulties that she would face both abroad and in building her company. While she was a student, she participated in two winter-term study abroad trips, one studying in the European Union and the other in Peru.

She credits these experiences with giving her more confidence to move alone to a new country and for shaping her mindset about travel. Her travels as an undergraduate also taught her what type of trip is ultimately transformative for people — being focused on deeper concepts than simply visiting a location, but also gaining cultural awareness.

Her entrepreneurial spirit was fueled by the opportunities that she had outside of the classroom. “Serving on Elonthon’s executive committee provided a lot of real-life experience managing a team, creating budgets and implementing logistics to achieve a common goal,” said MacLean.

Elonthon was her favorite tradition from her time as a student; she loved seeing students come together for such a great cause and successfully hold a large event every year for the greater good. She also credits her internship experience from her time as an undergraduate for preparing her for her career because she had the opportunity to work with Events DC. This internship gave her the hands-on experience that she needed to successfully begin her own travel company in another country.

One of the things that MacLean loved most about Elon when she was applying for college is that the Office of Admissions really focused on how much Elon values community involvement, leadership and extracurriculars in addition to academia. This is why she feels Elon has such successful alumni. “I believe this creates a very engaged community of individuals within Elon who are excited and motivated in their interests. I think that makes students pursue their passions and be well-rounded,” said MacLean.

As for her future, she plans to continue what she is doing, raising her family and furthering her business in Chile. Venture Patagonia is constantly working to have sustainable practices and support the local community, said MacLean. They just built a fossil museum and research center, the first of its kind in her region of Chile, and they also recently opened a store in Puerto Natales that sells handicrafts made solely by Chilean artisans, benefitting the local people. She hopes to continue these initiatives and expand her company’s itineraries throughout southern South America, building more experiences for her travelers.

For students that are interested in starting a business, MacLean encourages them to focus on defining their market and niche, two things she felt were crucial in starting her own company. These two things, along with willpower, are most important she said, “don’t wait until you are ready or you will never start.”

https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/patagonia-founder-gives-away-company-help-fight-climate-crisis-2022-09-14/,Patagonia founder gives away company to help fight climate crisis,"













Sept 14 (Reuters) - Yvon Chouinard, the billionaire founder of the outdoor apparel brand Patagonia, said on Wednesday he is giving away the company to a trust that will use its profit to fight the climate crisis.

Instead of selling the company or taking it public, Chouinard, who became famous for alpine climbs in Yosemite National Park and has a net worth of $1.2 billion, is transferring his family's ownership of the company to a trust and a non-profit organization.

""Each year, the money we make after reinvesting in the business will be distributed as a dividend to help fight the crisis,"" he wrote in an open letter on the company's website on Wednesday.

""Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we'll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth.""

Patagonia will continue to operate as a private, for-profit corporation but the Chouinard family, which controlled the company until last month, no longer own the company, according to the New York Times, which reported the move earlier on Wednesday.

The company's voting stock is being transferred to the Patagonia Purpose Trust while non-voting stock had been given to the Holdfast Collective, a non-profit dedicated to fighting the environmental crisis and defending nature. The trust will be overseen by members of the family.

While rich individuals often make financial contributions to causes, the New York Times said the structure of the Patagonia founder's action meant he and his family would get no financial benefit - and in fact would face a tax bill from the donation.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/clothing-company-save-planet-patagonia-find/story?id=90265309,Can a clothing company save the planet? Patagonia wants to find out.,"Patagonia's monumental donation could inspire other companies to do the same.

If there was any doubt about where outdoor clothing company Patagonia stood on environmentalism, it was quickly put to rest last week when founder Yvon Chouinard and his family donated their ownership to efforts that would protect the planet.

""Earth is now our only shareholder,"" Chouinard wrote on Patagonia's website.

But can the generous donation from a billionaire -- this one valued at more than $3 billion -- and the spoils from his successful retail company move the needle on finding solutions to mitigate global warming?

Experts told ABC News that the unprecedented move itself won't be enough to make significant strides in curbing emissions and the rise in global temperatures. But the domino effect that results from inspiring future philanthropists to make similar donations could reverberate throughout the climate fight, they hypothesized.

The drastic nature of the move is emblematic of the dire consequences that could result if major action is not taken, Hans Cole, head of environmental grants, campaigns and impact for Patagonia, told ABC News.

""It really just acknowledges the increasing urgency around the crisis -- around climate, around biodiversity, and around how those impact people and communities around the world,"" Cole said.

Here is what experts have to say about the monumental donation:

How the Patagonia donation is different from other billionaire philanthropy

Donations from the wealthiest Americans occur on a regular basis but rarely draw as much attention as the gift made by Chouinard.

The donation differs from most billionaire philanthropy for two key reasons.

First, the donation involves the giving away of Chouinard's company. Chouinard gave up nearly all of his shares in Patagonia and vowed to donate the company's annual profits. However, the maneuver draws on a two-tiered stock system of voting and non-voting shares, allowing Chouinard to retain control of the company.

Under the arrangement, Chouinard donated 98% of his non-voting shares in the company to a nonprofit, the Holdfast Collective. However, 2% of the shares -- which make up all of the company's voting shares -- will be retained in the Patagonia Purpose Trust.

""The Chouinards have total control of Patagonia through the trust, and they're giving everything else away,"" Daniel Hemel, a law professor at New York University, told ABC News.

The move is ""unusual but it's not unique,"" Hemel added, noting that dual-class share structures are used at companies such as Google and The New York Times. He also cited a similar model of philanthropy undertaken by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. ""Zuckerberg has mostly control of Facebook through the shares he's retained and he's giving some of it away,"" Hemel said.

Hemel said he lends ""credence"" to the rationale for continued control of Patagonia offered by Chouinard, who said the maneuver will allow him to protect the company's commitment to environment-friendly values.

The second feature of the donation that distinguishes it centers on the nonprofit formed by Chouinard, which will allow him to pursue political advocacy and donate to political candidates.

Most large-dollar philanthropy made by wealthy people goes to 501(c)(3) organizations, such as the Gates Foundation, Hemel said. Donations to such organizations are tax-deductible, but the groups are forbidden by law from participating in political campaigns or giving to political candidates.

However, the nonprofit created by Chouinard as the recipient of this donation, the Holdfast Collective, is classified as a 501(c)(4), which means the gift forgoes an income tax deduction but the organization can participate in politics. The Collective ""can advocate for causes and political candidates in addition to making grants and investments in our planet,"" Patagonia said on its website.

Philanthropists have made giant donations to the climate fight in the past

The donation from Chouinard, valued at more than $3 billion, joins a flurry of large-dollar philanthropy in recent years focused on the climate. While Chouinard's donation is smaller than that of some of his peers, the Holdfast Collective differs from other climate philanthropy because of its capacity to participate in political campaigns.

In 2020, Amazon Executive Chair Jeff Bezos pledged $10 billion to address climate change with the formation of the Bezos Earth Fund, which does not support political candidates. So far, the organization has granted $1.54 billion to programs that range from restoring mangroves in Columbia and Fiji to empowering grassroots environmental justice groups and providing technology for farmers in India.

Last year, Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of late Apple founder Steve Jobs, pledged $3.5 billion to fight climate change through the Waverley Street Foundation, an organization formed by Jobs in 2016.

It aims to address the problem by supporting local groups in communities worldwide that are ""at work in the trenches of the battle for a livable planet,"" the organization said last month. As a 501(c)(3), the Waverley Street Foundation is not allowed to participate in political campaigns.

Meanwhile, the ClimateWorks Foundation, which says it has granted over $1.3 billion to more than 600 grantees in over 50 countries, uses environmental expertise to channel donations for projects worldwide. As with the Bezos Earth Fund, the ClimateWorks Foundation supports a wide range of programs, including efforts to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and reverse forest loss.

The ClimateWorks Foundation doesn't participate in political campaigns, either, as it's also a 501(c)(3).

The approach from Chouinard -- a significant departure from most billionaire climate giving -- allows the organization to amplify its impact, Hemel said.

""What the Chouinards realize is that effective action to protect the planet from climate change is going to need to be government action,"" he said. ""Three billion dollars potentially can make a difference in elections.""

If they were to spend ""a fraction"" of the $3 billion on a U.S. Senate race, for example, that ends up changing the Senate majority, ""then they could be leveraging that fraction of $3 billion into hundreds of billions in additional climate investment,"" Hemel added.

Harvey Dale, a professor of philanthropy and law at New York University, echoed the view that the scale of private giving on climate-related issues pales in comparison with public spending.

""I suppose if you took all the money in all the foundations in the country -- many hundreds of billions of dollars -- you would say, 'Wow, how about that,'"" Dale told ABC News. ""It's a tiny bit compared to the amount [President Joe] Biden recommended in legislation just a year or two ago.""

To adequately address climate change, the scale of public investment must far outweigh that of the donor community, Dale said.

""The amount of money in the philanthropic sector is a drop in the bucket compared to how much the government would spend,"" he added.

The donation follows the company's ethos of sustainability

Patagonia has decades of experience in working to make its carbon footprint as small as possible in addition to tackling aspects of the environmental crisis, Cole said.

The company says it uses materials with lower environmental impacts, has cleaned up parts of its supply chain and encourages practices such as a program that allows customers to sell or trade their used pieces.

""It has been a 50-year journey for us, absolutely throwing everything we can, all the resources possible,"" Cole said.

In the past few years, Patagonia has increased its environmental commitments, even changing its mission statement to saving the planet, Cole said. Customers who wear the Patagonia brand, often those committed to sports and pastimes that keep them out in nature, tend to agree with the goals.

Even after the transfer of ownership, Patagonia will continue to donate 1% of its sales each year to grassroots environmental nonprofits, according to its website.

The unprecedented donation could inspire more

Experts say that Patagonia could inspire other companies and wealthy philanthropists to join the race to mitigate climate change.

Patagonia hopes that as many businesses and organizations as possible will replicate or take pieces of their plan and adapt it to their unique situation, Cole said.

""We want this to have legs,"" he said.

Tailoring to the needs of companies of different sizes and operations will also be key, John Forrer, director of the Institute for Corporate Responsibility at George Washington University, said.

""You have your own company interests, you have your own company values, you have what your stakeholders think is a good idea,"" he told ABC News.

With any company that dedicates funds and a portion of its mission statement to the climate crisis, it will be important that it's not done with the sole intent of ""corporate greenwashing"" as a cheap PR stunt, tax breaks or profit motives, Rachel Cleetus, policy director and lead economist at the Union of Concerned Scientists' climate and energy program, told ABC News.

Rather, businesses need to really care about issues such as transitioning the economy to clean energy to make a difference -- something the Chouinard family has exemplified, Cleetus said, adding that there are many businesses that claim publicly they are for climate solutions but are actually lobbying for policies that undermine climate progress.

""Patagonia is in a whole different class, they're actually walking the walk. That's what we need more businesses to do,"" Cleetus said.

The world can't rely on the generosity of billionaires, experts say

Making meaningful gains in the urgent fight against global warming will require much more than donations from a handful of exceptionally rich individuals, the experts said. Especially since just 2% of global giving is allocated toward climate change mitigation, according to a report published in May by the Candid.

It will take systemic change across many sectors to fix a broken system that causes more harm to the planet, Cleetus said.

""The scale of the immensity and the urgency of the climate crisis is such that it won't be enough to have a few very rich people donate money,"" Cleetus said.

Cole added that the Chouinard family is aware that Patagonia, even with its lofty mission, can't solve the climate crisis on its own.

""We need, frankly, the entire business community and governments and civil society to work together to get this done,"" Cole said. ""We can't do it alone. Patagonia can't do it alone.""

In addition, those in charge of the funds will need to ensure they are allocated to the most appropriate sectors, the experts said.

Frontline communities -- or communities that will be most impacted by climate-related weather events as they intensify in the future -- should be prioritized, as well as impoverished and marginalized communities, Cleetus said, adding that the climate crisis is ""inequitable at its core.""

""It's often Black and brown and indigenous communities and very low-income communities -- so seeing where the needs are most acute,"" she said. ""Very often, there are also communities that are bearing the brunt of pollution from fossil fuels and have for a long time.""

Public policy from governments around the world to assertively address the challenge will be necessary, and philanthropy can help move the needle in that regard by providing assistance to governments when conceptualizing those policies, Jennifer Kitt, president of the Climate Leader Initiative, told ABC News.

This was evident two decades ago when philanthropies helped to pass policies to put solar panels on rooftops to generate power, which was a ""huge challenge"" -- especially when incorporating them into building codes, Kitt said.

The money could also be well spent on investing in new technologies that are ""actually going to make a difference"" in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, such as batteries and other forms of renewable power, Forrer said.

Educating the public about how the climate crisis affects them -- such as how the war in Ukraine is causing oil prices worldwide to skyrocket -- will also be a crucial way to use the funds, the experts said.

""Philanthropists can be quite influential in the ways that move too slowly and not to scale,"" Kitt said.

[+] purpose over profits. Photo credit: Getty Creative. getty

Yvon Chouinard, the founder of Patagonia, makes earth its only shareholder in a bold move but perhaps not a surprising one, considering what the world has come to know about the socially responsible brand. Chouinard, his wife and two adult children CHILDREN have transferred their ownership of Patagonia, valued at about $3 3 billion, to a specially designed trust and a nonprofit organization that will be focused on combating climate change and protecting undeveloped land around the globe GLOBE .

Chouinard is an American rock climber and environmentalist who quickly became one of the most influential leaders in the area of environmental philanthropy. Chouinard said he never wanted to be a businessman, stating, “I started as a craftsman, making climbing gear for my friends and myself, then got into apparel.”

Chouinard, who founded the company in 1 1 973, needed a succession plan that would continue the efforts put forth by the company for half a century. Chouinard’s love for the outdoors and the climbing began when he was 14 years old as a member of the Southern California Falconry Club. His love of nature and the environment made him very passionate about doing the right thing.





Turning capitalism on its head

The company’s latest move snubs profits in favor of purpose by giving itself away. The Chouinard family had to pay $17.5 million in taxes since the shares were donated as a gift and the company will no longer be distributing any profits to the family.

Some experts believe that the company will lose focus on its philanthropic goals without the financial incentive to succeed. Capitalism typically works on a system of performance driven by profits, but Patagonia is challenging the long-standing notion that only profits drive progress.

Chouinard and his wife were far ahead of the industry in their efforts to emphasize purpose over profits, but now many companies are moving toward a better understanding of the role they should take to address more significant environmental issues. Purpose alongside profits will win in the long run.

Here’s how Patagonia cleared the mountain for everyone else to follow.

Mother Nature wins the bid for Patagonia

According to the company, it has no choice but to put the company in the hands of owners who will continue its mission to do good for the environment. The Chouinard family could have taken the company public, but it stated, “What a disaster that would have been. Even public companies with good intentions are under too much pressure to create short-term gain at the expense of long-term vitality and responsibility.” Public companies become controlled by Wall Street and strategies can vary based on who is sitting on the board of directors. Activist investors, who buy stock in a publicly traded company with the intent of purposely changing how a company is run, could have completely altered the trajectory of Patagonia’s mission to save the earth from environmental disaster.

Patagonia could also have sold the company and used the proceeds to support environmental change. But there was no guarantee that a new owner would maintain the same values and continue expanding its efforts to help the environment and reduce consumerism, not to mention protecting the employees who currently work at the company. Selling the company was deemed too big of a risk.

Instead, the company is creating its own solution. All of the voting stock was transferred to a newly developed trust called Patagonia Purpose PRPS Trust. All the nonvoting stock was given to Holdfast Collective CO22 , a nonprofit dedicated to fighting environmental crises and defending nature.

Since its creation and throughout the growth of its product line, Patagonia has searched for ways to make positive changes to the environmental impact of consumerism. Starting with himself and his company, Chouinard’s philosophy has always been to create quality products while minimizing the impact on the planet. But going even beyond the environmental effects of manufacturing, production and retailing, the company became a tremendous advocate for saving the environment and its natural resources. In 1985, Patagonia imposed a 1% “earth tax” on itself. The funding from the tax has been used to support many environmental nonprofits around the world.

Don’t Buy This Jacket

In 20 20 11 on Black Friday, the company did something unheard of for the retailing industry. Patagonia ran an ad in the New York YORK2 Times NYT telling readers, “Don’t Buy This Jacket.” Many thought it was a clever marketing stunt, but it was not. Chouinard wanted consumers to think twice about buying products they did not need.

The first step in changing the growth of consumerism

The ad was a great effort that was unorthodox at the time. It brought attention to the impact of consumerism on the environment. The back story is that in 2005, Patagonia launched the Common Threads Recycling Program typically referred to as Common Threads. The surprising goal was to reduce the number of products customers purchased from the company. Patagonia was one of the first companies to provide customers the ability to repair clothing either by giving tips on repair or allowing customers to ship products back to its repair facility, the largest in North America at the time.

The company was also one of the first retailers to re-sell its own pre-owned products, a process in today’s retail environment that is commonplace, but back then it was groundbreaking. Patagonia put out a statement almost 20 years ago, saying, “It’s time for us as a company to address the issue of consumerism and do it head on. It would be hypocritical for us to work for environmental change without encouraging customers to think before they buy.”

https://umaine.edu/news/blog/2023/01/06/guillermo-figueroa-munoz-from-salmonids-in-patagonia-to-alewives-in-maine/,Guillermo Figueroa-Muñoz: From salmonids in Patagonia to alewives in Maine,"Guillermo Figueroa-Muñoz: From salmonids in Patagonia to alewives in Maine

Growing up in Chile’s Patagonia region, Guillermo Figueroa-Muñoz never imagined he would end up in Orono, Maine, over 6,000 miles away from his hometown of Puerto Cisnes. Thanks to a little luck and hard work, though, the University of Maine Ph.D. student is using the research skills he learned studying fisheries in his home country to research the reintroduction of alewives in Maine’s lakes — and learning English while he does so.

In graduate school in Chile, Figueroa-Muñoz studied the relationship between invasive salmonids and participated in sampling of salmon escaping from aquaculture facilities in Patagonia. It is a common occurrence — between 2010 and 2020, 5 million salmon escaped from these facilities. Since salmon are not native to the region, they could become invasive in the sensitive ecosystem, threatening freshwater fish populations and traditional livelihoods.

While finishing his master’s degree at the Universidad de Concepción in Chile, Figueroa-Muñoz worked with Ivan Arismendi, associate professor at Oregon State University’s Freshwater Ecology and Conservation Lab. Arismendi knew University of Maine’s Christina Murphy from her time doing a Fulbright project in Chile and from her time pursuing a Ph.D. at Oregon State University.

“It’s a very small word in fisheries,” Murphy laughs.

Murphy and Joseph Zydlewski, researchers in the U.S. Geological Survey Maine cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and faculty in the Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Conservation Biology, were looking for a Ph.D. student to work on a project about the reintroduction of alewives in freshwater systems in Maine. Alewives were present in Maine’s lakes hundreds of years ago, but their historic habitats have changed. The impact of bringing them back to Maine’s lakes and streams today — particularly on managed fisheries and recreational opportunities, like landlocked Atlantic salmon fishing — is a topic of great political, social and ecological interest to the state.

When Murphy reached out to her network to pass along the job opportunity, Arismendi suggested Figueroa-Muñoz because of his exceptional research skills, experience with similar projects in Chile, publications and grades.

There was one catch: Figueroa-Muñoz didn’t yet speak fluent English, and this particular project would require a significant amount of communication with stakeholders beyond UMaine.

“It has a lot of technical challenges and requirements to interact with people on the ground and be an effective communicator,” says Zydlewski.

Still, Arismendi encouraged Figueroa-Muñoz to apply for the position. After speaking with their candidate, Murphy and Zydlewski knew that Figueroa-Muñoz was the right choice for the job.

“He has experience in research techniques that are really ideally suited for this particular project. His experience in Chile was functionally analogous to the challenges he’s taking on here, looking at a fish that is coming from a marine environment into a freshwater system and trying to figure out the ecological roles,” Murphy says.

Murphy and Zydlewski made an effort to ensure that their new student would have everything he needed to succeed. In addition to conducting research, Figueroa-Muñoz has taken English classes through the Maine Bridge Program. His English speaking skills have improved tremendously since he started. Figueroa-Muñoz credits the instruction of head instructor Erin-Kate Sousa, but Zydleweski says it is as much a “measure of his capacity and his willingness to work.”

“It’s been wonderful to watch him go from really functioning in a rudimentary capacity to someone who has given really clear, concise scientific presentations multiple times,” Zydlewski says. “It’s part of his education and part of what he’s going to take out as his skill set. Frankly, he stepped into the project and he’s been phenomenal in it.”

Murphy and Zydlewski said that Figueroa-Muñoz’s passion as a scientist — as well as his knack for bonding with his labmates — has been an asset for the project and for the lab community.

“He exemplifies so many of the good qualities of an effective researcher,” Zydleweski says. “There’s many times where he’s been in a meeting and he’s said, ‘This is my dream.’ This is where he wants to be. He wants to gain a skill set and he wants to be a productive and influential person in the field of fisheries science. He wants to be useful and serve the public good. He has all the capacity and intellect as well as having the community skills.”

Figueroa-Muñoz’s co-advisers also believe that their student’s achievements in the field and in the community illustrate a vital lesson about equity in science.

“He thought the doors were going to be closed and locked because science can be really exclusionary if you don’t have the language tools,” Murphy says. “I think it just shows how important it is that we don’t take our responsibilities lightly as researchers and academics because we have a lot of power to provide opportunities and a responsibility to make sure that we are providing opportunities. If we want to make science a better, more inclusive place, the people who really want to be inside need those doors opened.”

For his part, Figueroa-Muñoz has been impressed with the resources at UMaine, the state’s R1 research university, as well as the support from various government agencies for his research.

“We are working with people from the Alewife Interaction Committee, and they are really accepting of my inclusion in this project,” he says.

Figueroa-Muñoz says that the experience of attending graduate school at the University of Maine — one that wouldn’t be possible, he insists, without the support of his wife Maria Rosita Buchoff, who moved to Maine from Chile with him — has been wonderful so far.

“This is, like, the best environment for doing research,” he says.

Still, he does hope to return to Chile after completing his Ph.D. to use all the skills he has learned in his native country. He certainly hasn’t forgotten his roots. In the spare moments between perfecting his English, preparing proposals and conducting research in the field, Figueroa-Muñoz recently led an article for the prestigious publication Science about how Chile’s new policy allowing artisanal and recreational fishers to capture salmon escaped from aquaculture facilities will help better manage the populations and minimize their environmental impact.

“I want to learn as much as possible here and come back to Chile and contribute to study the ecology of freshwater systems in Patagonia in terms of food webs and fish,” Figueroa-Muñoz says. “I would like to thank my advisers and my labmates. I’m living my dreams. I’m really proud of being here.”

Outdoor gear company Patagonia says “the earth is now our only shareholder” after transferring the company’s ownership from founder Yvon Chouinard and his family to two nonprofits established to fight climate change.

In a letter posted on the 50-year-old company’s website Wednesday night, Chouinard said Patagonia would transfer 100% of its voting stock to the Patagonia Purpose Trust, created to uphold the values of the company long known for its environmental activism. All of its nonvoting stock will go to the Holdfast Collective, a nonprofit “dedicated to fighting the environmental crisis and defending nature.”

“While we’re doing our best to address the environmental crisis, it’s not enough,” Chouinard wrote. “We needed to find a way to put more money into fighting the crisis while keeping the company’s values intact.”

Patagonia estimates that after reinvesting some profits back into the company, about $100 million annually will be distributed to the Holdfast Collective as a dividend, depending on the health of the business.

Grace Chiang Nicolette, The Center for Effective Philanthropy’s vice president of programming and external relations, said this unusual move by the Chouinard family may become a blueprint for company founders looking to donate their businesses to causes important to them.

“Business owners are often faced with fraught decisions on the future of their company when it’s time to sell,” said Nicolette, who also co-hosts the “Giving Done Right” podcast. “The very wealthy are also faced with the fact that their net worths are growing faster than they can conceive of giving it away. This plan makes the company’s social impact its guiding principle and I think we’re going to see more donors pursuing this approach.”

Chouinard said other options for the Ventura, California, company to dedicate itself to protecting the planet — selling the company and donating the proceeds; or taking the company public — were not viable for Patagonia’s ultimate goals.

“Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth,” Chouinard wrote.

Chuck Collins, the Institute for Policy Studies director of the Program on Inequality and the Common Good, said Chouinard’s actions reflect a personal connection to the environmental crisis and a desire to back up his beliefs with his wealth.

“It shows that somebody who has substantial wealth is responding with the kind of scale needed to address the problem,” he said. “He’s working with the tools that he’s got. And it’s a pretty good response.”

Patagonia CEO Ryan Gellert said in a statement that the Chouinards challenged him and others at the company to develop a new ownership structure.

“They wanted us to both protect the purpose of the business and immediately and perpetually release more funding to fight the environmental crisis,” Gellert wrote. “We believe this new structure delivers on both and we hope it will inspire a new way of doing business that puts people and planet first.”

Brian Mittendorf, a professor of accounting at Ohio State University who focuses on nonprofit organizations and their financial statements, said the new Patagonia structure is similar to the one Paul Newman created for his salad dressing company, Newman’s Own. The profits from the business go into the Newman’s Own Foundation, which donates to nonprofits supporting children facing adversity.

The difference is that the Holdfast Collective is organized as a 501(c)4 corporation, according to the New York Times, which first reported the ownership change. That allows it to lobby politicians, which a public benefit charity like Newman’s Own Foundation is not allowed to do.

“What I don’t think is getting enough attention here is that the tax advantages of choosing a donation to a charity over a social welfare organization just aren’t that pronounced in this particular case,” said Mittendorf. He noted that the gift tax the Chouinards will pay is on their initial investment in Patagonia, not on its current worth, estimated at $3 billion.

“I kind of just view it as a desire to retain control over the company while ensuring that the resources that the company generates are used for a particular goal,” he said.

Patagonia makes outdoor clothing, gear and accessories for everything from skiing to climbing and camping. The company said it will continue its previous charitable donations, including donating 1% of its sales each year to grassroots activists and remaining a B Corp, a designation for companies that prioritize social and environmental standards as well as profits.

The billionaire founder of outdoor apparel brand Patagonia, known for supporting environmental causes, says he is giving away the company to a trust that will use its profit to fight the climate crisis.

Yvon Chouinard, aged 83, who became famous for alpine climbs in Yosemite National Park and has a net worth of $1.2bn, could have sold the brand – valued at $3bn, according to The New York Times newspaper – or taken it public. He made the announcement on Wednesday.

Instead, he, his wife and their two children agreed to transfer all of Patagonia’s voting shares, or stock that gives the holder voting rights, in the company to a trust in charge of ensuring the brand’s environmental values are respected.

All of Patagonia’s non-voting shares have been transferred to a non-profit body dedicated to fighting against climate change and nature protection and conservation. Company profits will also be donated to the non-profit.

“Earth is now our only shareholder,” Chouinard wrote in an open letter on Wednesday posted to Patagonia’s website.

“I never wanted to be a businessman,” he explained. “I started as a craftsman, making climbing gear for my friends and myself, then got into apparel.”

He added: “As we began to witness the extent of global warming and ecological destruction, and our own contribution to it, Patagonia committed to using our company to change the way business was done.”

Instead of “going public,” you could say we’re “going purpose.” Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth.

Founded almost 50 years ago, Patagonia quickly became committed to conserving nature, by carefully choosing its raw materials and donating one percent of its sales each year to environmental non-governmental organisations or NGOs.

But Chouinard has decided this is no longer enough.

One option was to sell Patagonia and donate the money. “But we couldn’t be sure a new owner would maintain our values or keep our team of people around the world employed,” he said in the letter.

Taking the company public would have been a “disaster,” he said: “Even public companies with good intentions are under too much pressure to create short-term gain at the expense of long-term vitality and responsibility.”

Patagonia will remain a company, which cares about its financial health and will operate with a board of directors and a CEO.

The Chouinard family will no longer get any money from the company but will stay on the board, oversee the trust and guide the nonprofit’s philanthropic work.

After the announcement, members of Patogania’s board celebrated the decision.

“Instead of exploiting natural resources to make shareholder returns, we are turning shareholder capitalism on its head by making the Earth our only shareholder,” Charles Conn, chair of the board, said in an open letter.

“As a closely held company, this huge change was easier for us than others. But the point is for companies to make transparent purpose commitments that make sense to their business, and to be held to account by their communities,” he added.",[],2022-09-15 00:00:00

High-end outdoor clothing brand Patagonia Inc is taking on fast fashion retailer Gap for copying its “iconic” fleece jacket design. Patagonia Inc has filed court proceedings in the Federal Court.

In a complaint filed on 22 November 2022, Patagonia alleges that Gap willfully and deliberately copied the fleece design through the creation and sale of its “Mockneck Pullover” jackets, mimicking the flap pocket and rectangular logo of Patagonia’s classic “Snap-T” fleece jackets (shown below).

Images taken from Patagonia website at URL: www.patagonia.com and GAP website at URL: www.gap.com.

A one star customer review of the Gap Product was submitted in the complaint, in which the consumer observed that the product was an “obvious Pata*gonia ripoff [sic]” and stated they “had to zoom in” to confirm the logo was Gap.

The Snap-T pullover fleece was introduced in 1985, with the flap pocket added to the design in 1989. Patagonia claims the Snap-T has since become an immediately recognizable Patagonia design and a “well known” trade dress, consisting of the snap placket and matching pocket flap, rendered in contrasting colour from the fleece and in a different fabrication. The Snap-T design has also featured in a New York Museum of Modern Art exhibit, and in the Victoria & Albert Gallery.

Patagonia alleges that Gap’s “adoption of designs and logos … cannot have occurred by accident” as it mimics all elements of this “iconic” trade dress. Patagonia states the Gap Product has and will continue to dilute the distinctive quality of Patagonia’s trade marks and trade dress, and is likely to cause confusion among consumers about the product source, or induce consumers to believing a collaboration has occurred.

Patagonia seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages in the form of its damages and lost profits and Gap’s profits attributable to the infringing conduct.

NEXT Energy Technologies got its start 10 years ago at a Santa Barbara office park, where a small team of UCSB grads toiling away on equipment bought at auction achieved something amazing. They developed a transparent photovoltaic (PV) coating that turns commercial windows into energy-producing surfaces, opening the door to a whole new world of solar power.

Last month, NEXT teamed up with Patagonia ― a globally recognized brand and leader in sustainable business practices ― to install 22 of their windows at the company’s headquarters in Ventura. It marked the first time NEXT’s technology is being demonstrated outside the lab and on a building.

NEXT CEO Daniel Emmett called it “a huge milestone for us. … We’re grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with Patagonia to demonstrate our technology in action and share the numerous benefits to building owners, developers, and occupants.” Those benefits, he said, include “reduced operating expenses, increased building value, improved building resilience, relieved pressure and reliance on the grid, and reduced carbon footprint.”

The windows went up on the south-facing face of the Olive Building on Patagonia’s main campus and will deliver dedicated power to common spaces for charging phones and other devices. The company has been using solar power at its headquarters in Ventura since 2005 and at its Reno Distribution Center since 1996, said Patagonia spokesperson Corley Kenna. “We rely on 100 percent renewable electricity for our owned and operated facilities in the United States and 76 percent globally,” Kenna said. “Finding better ways of doing business is something we always strive to do, and we’re pleased to partner with NEXT Energy.”

NEXT’s windows are made by printing a transparent photovoltaic coating ― made of organic semiconducting materials ― directly onto glass, which is then sealed behind a second sheet of glass integrated into a traditional glazing system. “We spent years of R&D to design façade systems for Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV),” said Shiloh Kocelj of Walters & Wolf, a glass fabrication company working with NEXT. “The dream of a seamless plug and play BIPV façade is a reality, and we are all very excited for the possibilities.”

NEXT estimates its windows are capable of producing 20-30 percent of the power produced by conventional solar panels alone. And by leveraging building faces, instead of just rooftops, its windows have the potential to offset anywhere from 10 to 40 percent of a typical commercial structure’s energy load, the company said.

“Global building stock is expected to double by 2060, and if transparent PV windows can be deployed widely on buildings during this timeframe, they have the potential to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by over one gigaton per year, a huge opportunity for climate impact,” Emmett said.

https://www.voanews.com/a/patagonia-founder-donates-company-to-charity/6749946.html,Patagonia Founder Donates Company to Charity,"Yvon Chouinard, the 83-year-old founder of the outdoor clothing and equipment company Patagonia, announced that he has placed 100% of the shares of his $3 billion company in a trust, which will direct future profits of the company to efforts to protect the environment and combat climate change.

“Earth is now our only shareholder,” Chouinard wrote in an open letter describing the decision, which places all of the voting stock in the company under the control of the Patagonia Purpose Trust, and all of the non-voting stock under the control of the Holdfast Collective, a nonprofit “dedicated to fighting the environmental crisis and defending nature.”

Under the plan, the Chouinard family will control the Patagonia Purpose Trust, and through it will exercise control over the company’s operations. The family will also “guide the philanthropic work performed by the Holdfast Collective,” according to a release issued by Patagonia.

Under the new structure, the company will continue to function and to invest in its operations, but all profits not reinvested in the company will be distributed as dividends to the Holdfast Collective, which will direct them to environmental causes.

Avoiding ‘disaster’

The move adds Chouinard to the list of billionaires, including Berkshire Hathaway founder Warren Buffett, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and former Wipro Limited chairman Azim Premji, who have promised to give large shares of their personal wealth to charity.

Chouinard said that he made the decision after considering other options, including selling the company and donating the profits. “But we couldn’t be sure a new owner would maintain our values or keep our team of people around the world employed,” he said.

Likewise, he dismissed the idea of taking the company public, writing, “What a disaster that would have been. Even public companies with good intentions are under too much pressure to create short-term gain at the expense of long-term vitality and responsibility.”

Former mountaineer

Chouinard was born in Lewiston, Maine, in 1938, but moved with his family to Southern California in 1947. It was in California that he became deeply involved in rock climbing and eventually, alpine climbing.

As a young man, Chouinard taught himself blacksmithing in order to make some of his own climbing equipment, and the sales of his handmade pitons — spikes driven between rocks in order to create points of stability — were the beginning of the business that would eventually become Patagonia.

The company has long been environmentally active. In the early 1970s, when it became clear that the widespread use of its pitons was damaging mountain faces, Patagonia invented a hexagonal aluminum “chock” that could be used as a non-damaging alternative. Since the 1980s, it has dedicated 10% of profits to environmental causes.

Billionaires and charity

In turning over the profits of his company to a charitable organization, Chouinard is far from the only extremely wealthy person in the world to surrender the bulk of their wealth to philanthropic pursuits, but doing so isn’t the norm, either.

In 2010, Gates and Buffett announced the launch of the Giving Pledge campaign, an effort to persuade the world’s wealthiest people to commit to giving away at least 50% of their net worth at or before their deaths.

To date, 236 individuals, the vast majority of them billionaires, have signed the pledge. However, they represent a small fraction of what Forbes magazine estimates to be the approximately 2,700 billionaires in the world.

Around the world

Some of the world’s wealthiest people have, with or without signing a formal pledge, donated considerable sums to charity.

Premji, the Indian billionaire who built Wipro, has reportedly donated well over 25% of his net worth, including $7.6 billion worth of shares in his company, to charitable causes, including education initiatives in his native country.

Sheik Sulaiman bin Abdulaziz bin Saleh Al Rajhi, a native of Saudi Arabia who earned his fortune in Islamic banking, announced a decade ago that he would give away most of his $7.7 billion fortune, and has spent large sums endowing a university, among other efforts.

Huang Zheng, founder of Chinese online shopping giant Pinduoduo and one of the wealthiest people in China, has given away billions of dollars, including a recent donation of $1.85 billion to a charitable foundation.

Strive Masiyiwa, the Zimbabwean telecommunications billionaire, has funded many large philanthropic efforts in his home country and around the world, and is also a signatory of the Giving Pledge.

Some giving deferred

Forbes, which has long tracked the wealth of the richest citizens in the United States, has developed a philanthropy score, which tracks, on a scale of one to five, how much the country’s wealthiest have given away.

Those who score a five are among the most charitable, having given away 20% or more of their net worth. Those who score a one, meaning they are among the least charitable, have given away less than 1% of their net worth.

In 2021, the magazine found that 156 of the 400 richest Americans scored in the lowest quintile, while just 19 were in the top two quintiles, meaning they had given away at least 10% of their net worth.

Notable names among those scoring in the lowest quintile include America’s two wealthiest men, Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos and Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk. Also listed as having donated less than 1% of their net worth were Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and Oracle founder Larry Ellison.

Bezos stepped up his philanthropic activities in 2022, and others, including Musk and Ellison, have signed the Giving Pledge, indicating that at some point, they plan to make substantial philanthropic donations.",['Rob Garver'],

The bold business decision enshrines a new shareholder for the famous outdoor clothing company — planet Earth — and continues the Chouinard family’s dedication to combating climate change and promoting conservation causes.

“It’s been a half-century since we began our experiment in responsible business,"" Chouinard said in a statement. ""If we have any hope of a thriving planet 50 years from now, it demands all of us doing all we can with the resources we have. As the business leader I never wanted to be, I am doing my part. Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth, we are using the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source. We’re making Earth our only shareholder. I am dead serious about saving this planet.”

Patagonia is now owned by two entities, the Patagonia Purpose Trust and the Holdfast Collective, which together will control the company’s direction going forward and direct “every dollar that is not reinvested back into Patagonia [to] be distributed as dividends to protect the planet.”

That means that upwards of $100 million annually will be donated to environmental efforts through this arrangement.

Patagonia has been increasingly vocal about its environmental beliefs in recent years, donating Black Friday day sales to environmental causes, suing the former Trump administration to protect public lands, distancing itself from companies that harm the planet, and establishing protected land areas.

In a public letter, Chouinard describes how these and other efforts, including donating 1% of company profits to the planet and changing the mission statement, weren’t enough in the context of the worsening climate crisis.

The two most likely routes — selling the company and donating the sale profits or going public — didn’t interest him.

“One option was to sell Patagonia and donate all the money. But we couldn’t be sure a new owner would maintain our values or keep our team of people around the world employed,” he wrote. “Another path was to take the company public. What a disaster that would have been. Even public companies with good intentions are under too much pressure to create short-term gain at the expense of long-term vitality and responsibility.”

In the end, the new structure maximizes the amount of money from the company that could benefit the planet, while ensuring that the Patagonia brand remains a symbol of conservation.

This is the sort of bold action that could spur broader change throughout both the public and private sectors. Just imagine what sort of transformation would be possible if more people in positions of power gained the courage to value the planet over personal profit?

“Despite its immensity, the Earth’s resources are not infinite, and it’s clear we’ve exceeded its limits,” Chouinard wrote. “But it’s also resilient. We can save our planet if we commit to it.”",['Joe Mccarthy'],

According to Reuters, Patagonia filed a complaint in San Francisco federal court on Tuesday night, citing Gap’s recent sale of fleece jackets that illegally copy both its buttoned flap pocket design and the rectangular “P-6” logo which depicts a mountain range. The “adoption of designs and logos bearing even more similarity cannot have occurred by accident,” writes Patagonia. Part of the lawsuit references a one-star review of Gap’s product which writes, “Obvious Pata*gonia ripoff. I had to zoom in just to ensure that the logo was GAP.”

Patagonia alleges that Gap is violating a trade law element called trade dress, or the characteristics of a product's appearance that tell customers who made the product. According to Patagonia, the similarities between its product and Gap's ""cannot have occurred by accident.""

It's a serious suit, as Patagonia seeks trial and damages in addition to all Snap-T Fleece profits and Gap's fleece inventory.

https://gizmodo.com/patagonia-giving-profits-to-environmental-action-tax-1849546111,Don't Rush to Canonize Patagonia,"The founder of Patagonia said this week in an exclusive interview with the New York Times that he’s giving away his company to support environmental protection. Yvon Chouinard, the rock-climber-turned-businessman who has long pushed his company as the face of progressive corporate environmentalism, told the Times that he wants to “give away the maximum amount of money to people who are actively working on saving this planet.” But even in what seems like a best-case development for green capitalism, there’s some important PR spin to wade through.

Let’s first review what the change actually means for the Chouinard family and the company. The family gave all the nonvoting shares of Patagonia, currently worth about $3 billion, to a newly formed nonprofit called the Holdfast Collective; Patagonia will stay a for-profit business, but those profits, which amount to around $100 million a year, will now go entirely to this group. A trust now owns the family’s voting shares, which comprise about 2% of the company, and the Chouinard family and its advisers will be in charge of this trust.

“Instead of ‘going public,’ you could say we’re ‘going purpose,’” Chouinard said in a statement on the Patagonia website, which has a flashy section devoted to the announcement titled “Reimagining Capitalism.” “Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth.”



While Patagonia may posit itself as “reimagining capitalism,” this particular manipulation of the control of a company has been done before. As Daniel Hemel, a professor at NYU’s School of Law, pointed out on Twitter, businessman Barre Seid used a nearly identical formulation of tax benefit manipulation to transfer $1.6 billion to Leonard Leo, the activist who is in part responsible for the successful push to secure a conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court, leading directly to catastrophic environmental decisions like West Virginia vs. EPA.

What’s more, the Patagonia transferral isn’t without some perks to the family—there are some significant tax benefits involved. As Bloomberg pointed out, some of the other options on the table would have meant hefty fees for Chouinard: the sale of the $3 billion company could have meant paying more than $700 million in capital gains tax, while his heirs would have had to pay some 40% in estate tax if the company were transferred directly to them. As it stands, the deal still costs some $17.5 million in gift taxes for Chouinard. That’s a hefty sum, sure, but small potatoes given the other possibilities.

“We are letting people opt out of supporting all the expenses of government to do whatever they want with their money,” Ray Madoff, a professor at Boston College Law School, told Bloomberg. “This is highly problematic from the point of view of democracy, and it can mean a higher tax burden for the rest of Americans.”

Both a sale and passing the company to heirs would have entailed keeping the profits of Patagonia—something Chouinard expressly does not want to do. This week’s moves makes him, on paper, poorer than when he started. However, the strategy to set up a nonprofit and a trust controlled by the family is its own power move: It ensures that the company’s cultural capital now comes with a potentially powerful donor arm that can exert influence in the policy space. Think of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Jeff Bezos’s Earth Fund, or Mark Zuckerberg’s Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. It’s also notable that the nonprofit is a 501(c)(4), which allows it to directly participate in political giving. There were other options at play—Chouinard could have chosen to give profits back to employees, or give profits directly each year to grassroots charities—but none that gives the family and company the influence this option does.

We also know next to nothing about the new nonprofit that will receive the funding from Patagonia’s profits. The company said that the Holdfast Collective “will use every dollar received to fight the environmental crisis, protect nature and biodiversity, and support thriving communities, as quickly as possible”—a pretty broad mandate that can mean many different things.

Looking at Chouinard’s own environmental interests and the organizations and causes he has supported could provide some clues. Patagonia has long been recognized as one of the best models of corporate responsibility when it comes to supporting grassroots environmental groups, while Chouinard himself has also been outspoken about the uselessness of billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk racing to space (a premise we at Earther agree with).

But some of his chosen causes have been troubling. Last year, Chouinard provided a positive pull quote for a book called Bright Green Lies, which was authored by the three leaders of a radical environmental group called Deep Green Resistance. As Earther reported in February, the group and its leaders not only espouse eco-extremist ideology—including having an anti-civilization bent—but also have transphobic ideology woven into the roots of their organization. In April, Politico released an investigation into allegations of transphobia inside the nonprofit Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund; as Politico notes, Patagonia was a supporter of that nonprofit.

“Patagonia and Yvon Chouinard have a 50-year track record of supporting the grassroots environmental community,” J.J. Huggins, Patagonia spokesman, told Earther in an email. “We invite you speak with any of the 1,000-plus groups we fund, or examine our support for the LGBTQ+ community, including our support for federal and state legislation to protect marriage equality and trans rights, along with our support for reproductive rights.”

The fact that a nonprofit organization is not-for-profit does not mean that its activities are automatically noble, useful, or even a net good; I’m curious to see what direction Holdfast Collective chooses to take its giving, and if they’ll avoid some of these very problematic pitfalls.

Chouinard’s public image has long been one of a “reluctant billionaire”: a rock climber entrepreneur who never wanted to be rich. If we’re going to have super-rich people, Chouinard is a far better option than many others. But the way that he is handing off his company must also be recognized as a PR act: as Matt Levine of Bloomberg put it, the way the deal was made “allows Chouinard to say that he ‘no longer owns the company’ and have a New York Times headline saying ‘Billionaire No More,’ which seems to have been an important goal,” while still maintaining a lot of control of the company. We need to ensure we’re keeping an eye on Patagonia’s own new brand of capitalism, as well.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/patagonia-gives-away-company-to-climate-change-nonprofit/,Patagonia founder gives away company to climate-change organization,"Yvon Chouinard, the founder of outdoor gear company Patagonia, has given the company away to two environmental organizations, a move he predicts will yield $100 million a year to help fund their efforts.

Chouinard said on Wednesday that he has transferred ownership of Patagonia, which he founded in 1973, to Patagonia Purpose Trust and the Holdfast Collective.

""Earth is now our only shareholder,"" the 83-year-old founder said in a letter posted on Patagonia's website.

""If we have any hope of a thriving planet — much less a thriving business — 50 years from now, it is going to take all of us doing what we can with the resources we have,"" the letter read.

The Holdfast Collective will control the bulk of Patagonia stock — about 98% — and receive all the profits that aren't reinvested in the company. It ""will use every dollar received from Patagonia to protect nature and biodiversity, support thriving communities, and fight the environmental crisis,"" the company said.

The trust will control the 2% of Patagonia stock that has voting power and will ensure the company's future decisions are in line with its founder's environmental goals. It will be overseen by members of the Chouinard family and their advisers, according to the New York Times.

Patagonia's leadership will stay the same, and Chouinard family members will continue to serve on the board, the company said.

Patagonia started nearly 50 years ago, growing out of Chouinard's love of mountaineering and expanding into other product lines as his interests dictated. It was a pioneer in sustainable sourcing, adopting organic cotton, a clothing repair service and generous workers benefits like onsite childcare. Today the company is valued at approximately $3 billion and sells everything from ski jackets to sustainably sourced salmon jerky. It is also a B corporation and donates 1% of its annual profits to environmental causes.

Patagonia's commercial success turned Chouinard into an unlikely billionaire — a status that ""really, really pissed me off,"" he told the Times. By giving away most of their assets during their lifetime, the Chouinard family has established itself as one of the nation's most charitable, the Times said.

The Chouinards will also pay a roughly $17 million gift tax on the stock donated to the Holdfast Collective, the Times said. The collective is classified as a 501(c)(4) organization, instead of a typical nonprofit. The unusual legal structure is a way to ensure the company fulfills its founder's ideals even after his death, Chouinard said in his letter.

""Instead of 'going public,' you could say we're 'going purpose.'

https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/15/yvon-chouinard-donates-patagonia-to-fight-climate-change-protect-land.html,Why Patagonia's billionaire founder gave away his $3 billion company to fight climate change: 'Earth is now our only shareholder',"The founder of outdoor apparel maker Patagonia is donating his company to a greater cause: fighting climate change.

Yvon Chouinard, the rock climber-turned-billionaire, and his family have transferred their ownership of Patagonia to the newly created Patagonia Purpose Trust and nonprofit Holdfast Collective. The two entities will ensure that all of Patagonia's profits go toward combating the climate crisis and protecting undeveloped land across the world, the company announced on Wednesday.

Patagonia expects to generate and donate roughly $100 million in profits annually, depending on the health of the business, the company said. The company, which Chouinard founded in 1973, is worth $3 billion, according to the New York Times.

Chouinard himself has a $1.2 billion net worth, as of Thursday morning. ""Earth is now our only shareholder,"" he wrote in a letter released on the company's website late Wednesday, adding: ""While we're doing our best to address the environmental crisis, it's not enough. We needed to find a way to put more money into fighting the crisis while keeping the company's values intact.""

When reached for comment, a Patagonia spokesperson pointed CNBC Make It to the company's Wednesday announcement.

""The Patagonia Purpose Trust ... exists to create a more permanent legal structure to enshrine Patagonia's purpose and values,"" the announcement reads. ""It will help ensure that there is never deviation from the intent of the founder and to facilitate what the company continues to do best: demonstrate as a for-profit business that capitalism can work for the planet.""

The company's mission can be traced to Chouinard's humble beginnings. In the 1960s, he was a pioneering rock climber in California who lived out of his car and ate damaged cans of cat food he purchased for 5 cents apiece, the Times reported. He was also a craftsman who made climbing gear and apparel for himself and his friends.

""I never wanted to be a businessman,"" Chouinard wrote in his letter, adding that he only realized the ""extent of global warming and ecological destruction, and our own contribution to it"" once he entered the apparel industry.

Today, Patagonia is a B corporation, a designation conferred on private companies that meet the highest environmental, social and governance standards set by global nonprofit B Lab. As part of those efforts, Patagonia sources eco-friendly clothing materials and annually donates 1% of its total sales to grassroots activists.

The company plans to continue those efforts, according to Chouinard's letter. As of this year, about 88% of its products are made from recycled or renewable materials like recycled polyester and organically grown cotton, the company says.

Patagonia's public goal is to use 100% of those materials in their products by 2025. The company says it already uses 100% renewable energy in its stores, offices and distribution centers.

In 2019, The United Nations Environment Programme recognized Patagonia for its commitment to environmental sustainability and advocacy. The company has also become more politically outspoken in recent years, suing the Trump administration in 2017 over plans to shrink several national monuments in Utah.

""Despite its immensity, the Earth's resources are not infinite, and it's clear we've exceeded its limits,"" Chouinard wrote on Wednesday. ""But it's also resilient. We can save our planet if we commit to it.""

It seems like every outdoor brand and every style brand has its own spin on the classic garment, whether it's a straightforward, stylish waxed jacket or a highly technical shell outfitted with any number of proprietary monikers and superlatives. Dig a little deeper, though, and you'll find that those superlatives and technologies really do make a difference when it comes to protecting the wearer from precipitation, and will dictate the situations where reaching for a raincoat makes sense.

To sift through the noise, we took our two favorite raincoats, the Patagonia Granite Crest and The North Face Dryzzle FUTRELIGHT, and put them through their paces, hoping to determine which is the true GOAT of the rain jacket world.

First Up: Patagonia Granite Crest Jacket

What I liked about the jacket

This jacket is certainly purpose-built, which I very much appreciate in a world where every garment is expected to thrive in any situation. Patagonia has always taken care to ensure that its garments actually perform well in the field, no matter how many finance bros start rocking puffy vests to work in midtown Manhattan or downtown San Francisco. The Granite Crest Jacket is no exception — you can tell it's truly made for the outdoors from the first time you put it on. Hell, even some of the studio shots of the jacket on Patagonia's website show the model wearing a climbing harness. To me, this is a huge draw.

Patagonia

I also appreciate the fact that Patagonia is sticking to its guns and helping shape a better future for all of us with its sustainability practices. I don't want to overstate this, because manufacturing is still a flawed system in the end, but the Granite Crest is made about as responsibly as you can get. It is crafted with 100 percent post-consumer recycled ripstop made from fishing nets. Its waterproofing features a PFC-free DWR finish (a durable water repellent coating that does not contain perfluorinated chemicals) and still meets Patagonia's stringent H2No performance standard.

What I didn't like about the jacket

While I love that it's purpose built — the hood is even perfectly sized to fit over a climbing helmet — I found that this makes it a little more difficult to wear each and every day. When I wore the hood without a helmet, it came down over my eyes, making it tough to see anywhere but straight forward and straight down, which isn't ideal for checking both ways before I cross the street. The jacket also has that semi-glossy shine that is common with ripstop outdoor gear (think tents, rain jackets and puffers, just to name a few). This isn't inherently a bad thing — I dig it in the outdoors —but it does make it tough to mix it with clothes that don't strictly follow the Gorp-core guidelines. When I wear it with jeans or nicer pants and shoes that aren't hiking boots or sneakers, the jacket looks distinctly out of place.

Told you the hood was enormous. Will Porter

The jacket is also very warm, but not necessarily in a good way. It doesn't tout itself as a particularly breathable jacket, and it's not, so keep in mind that if you want to rock this on a humid day, you may come to regret it. The pit zips are an essential feature of this jacket, but even then, I can really only wear this on cold days. Don't even think about wearing it over a tee shirt, unless you like sweaty arms.

Next Up: The North Face Dryzzle FUTURELIGHT Jacket

What I liked about the jacket

To start with a direct contrast from the Patagonia jacket above, I love the Dryzzle FUTURELIGHT because of its versatility and breathability, which make it perfect for city wear. While I get to the outdoors as often as possible, the reality is that most of my life is spent in the concrete jungle, so I need garments that can thrive with any outfit and in any condition, from a drizzle (pun not intended by me, but intended by TNF) to a downpour to a snow storm. It also lacks the shine of the Patagonia jacket, making it ideal for city dressing — it just looks better with most of my wardrobe.

I made sure to set the photo shoot for the dreariest Brooklyn day. Will Porter

The shell is fully waterproof and crafted from a soft stretch-woven face and stretch-knit backing, which is extremely comfortable and a bit easier to move in than the Granite Crest jacket. Like the Granite Crest, it also features a non-PFC DWR finish, adding a bit of extra water repellency to the waterproofing and taped seams. I also appreciate the small details like flaps over the pocket zippers to keep moisture out, and pocket locations that are perfect for keeping your hands dry and comfortable. The brand says this is a slim fit jacket, but I'm a medium in almost all outerwear and the medium fits me perfectly, even with a bulky hoodie or light puffy layer underneath.

What I didn't like about the jacket

Honestly, there isn't a lot I don't like about this jacket, so I won't belabor the point. I'd prefer a hood that fit just a tad better and had a longer, more protective bill, but it still fits nicely over a hoodie and kept my head dry.

The fit, while it isn't as slim as they said it was, could be a bit more boxy, but that's definitely a personal preference. As I stated above a medium is the perfect fit for me, but it'd be great to be able to sport a warmer puffer underneath, especially if I'm looking to take advantage of the waterproofing on a really cold day.

My only other complaint is that the zipper doesn't zip straight to the top very smoothly — the flap behind the zipper tends to get caught 3/4 of the way up.

https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/how-patagonia-surfed-around-death-and-taxes,How Patagonia Surfed Around Death and Taxes,"When 73-year-old adventurer Rick Ridgeway learned that his old buddy Yvon Chouinard was giving away outdoor retailer Patagonia to a nonprofit that will donate the company’s profits to environmental work, he wasn’t terribly surprised. Ridgeway has known Chouinard, the company’s 83-year-old founder, since the early 1970s, when the pair bonded during trips to climb and surf in remote places. Then, Ridgeway spent 15 years leading Patagonia’s environmental initiatives and public engagement. The company’s fidelity to green values, he said, was clear from the start.

“Patagonia’s always been one step ahead, out in the vanguard exploring new ways to do things,” Ridgeway said. “The company’s had that commitment since it started 50 years ago.”

On September 14, Patagonia made headlines when Chouinard announced that he was transferring 98 percent of the family-owned company—and all its nonvoting stock—to the nonprofit Holdfast Collective, an advocacy group with a mission to “fight the environmental crisis, protect nature and biodiversity, and support thriving communities.”

The remaining 2 percent—plus the voting power to guide the company—goes to the Patagonia Purpose Trust overseen by members of the Chouinard family. In Patagonia’s ebullient terms: “Earth is now our only shareholder.”

Patagonia projects that the Holdfast Collective will spend or donate $100 million each year, creating an overnight heavyweight among America’s environmental groups and philanthropies. Calling this the “biggest milestone in the company’s history,” Ridgeway estimated a ten-fold increase of the company’s current charitable donations. It’s a major windfall for the environmental movement. And it’s also a creative way to dodge two things that keep many aging founders awake at night: death and taxes.

During his time at Patagonia, Ridgeway saw firsthand the Chouinard family’s quest to secure the company’s legacy. “It was a real conundrum,” he said. “Not just for the tax consequences. The conundrum at its highest level centered around how to inculcate, into the structure of the company, its core values, so that those values would be preserved after the Chouinards were dead.”

Those core values include a longtime dedication to sustainability work. In 2002, Chouinard cofounded the charitable giving network 1% for the Planet, pledging Patagonia would give away 1 percent of annual sales to grassroots environmental nonprofits. (It will continue to do so.) A decade later, Patagonia became California’s first B-Corp, a certification for companies with environmental or social missions.

For entrepreneurs seeking to cement such legacies, “there’s a limited set of options,” said Stuart Hart, cofounder of the sustainable innovation MBA program at the University of Vermont. Hart said that for years Patagonia has explored many succession options. Going public and selling are two common routes. But each can mean losing control, Hart explained, adding that such a move is painful for many leaders. “This was the option that ensured the longevity and perpetuity of the mission for the company,” he said.

When news about the Patagonia transfer broke on the afternoon of September 14, public reaction had a joyous tone rarely linked to conversations about corporate restructuring. “BRB gonna cover myself head to foot in Patagonia,” tweeted publisher Lisa Lucas. Writer Rebecca Solnit tweeted that Chouinard was “annihilated as a billionaire; enhanced as a hero.”

Even as they applauded the move as altruistic, some observers also noted it would avoid massive tax liabilities for the Chouinard family. While the New York Times article that first reported the Patagonia story quoted a company adviser saying it brings the Chouinards “no tax benefit,” that’s incorrect, said Daniel Hemel, an expert in tax law and a professor at New York University School of Law.

“The Chouinards got a huge tax benefit from this,” Hemel said. By keeping control of just 2 percent of Patagonia, the family can contribute to political campaigns by proxy and steer the company while minimizing their tax liability on a $3 billion corporation, Hemel said. The nonprofit Holdfast Collective can use the company’s money for advocacy work. Crucially, its 501(c)(4) designation allows the collective to put money into political campaigns—something a traditional 501(c)(3) charity is banned from.

“If I give $3 billion to you, I’d owe $1.2 billion in gift tax,” Hemel said. “They figured out a way to give $3 billion away, having it not go to a traditional charity, and instead of paying $1.2 billion in gift tax, they’re paying $17 million in tax. So they cut their gift tax bill by more than 98 percent.”

This does not, Hemel stressed, undercut the impact of the move. The Chouinard family is giving up a vast fortune. Their tax savings translate to even more funding for environmental advocacy. The family is both playing by the tax rules and working to save the planet. Chouinard is, famously, a “reluctant billionaire,” and he really does want to save the planet.

Still, by ploughing the company’s earnings into a nonprofit supporting political campaigns, the Chouinard family has drawn attention to a part of tax law that many experts find disturbing. “The ability to give stock to a c-4, then have the c-4 cash out of dividends and capital gains tax-free, that can be used for good or ill,” Hemel said. Last month, The New York Times reported that financier Barre Seid used a similar move to donate $1.6 billion in company shares to the conservative Marble Freedom Trust helmed by dark-money guru Leonard Leo. Such donations divert funds from the government to the hands of powerful individuals. And they can bring a large—and largely opaque—infusion of cash into politics.

“I don’t think that’s an argument against what the Chouinards did. If I were in the Chouinards’ position, I hope I’d be generous enough to do the same,” Hemel said. ""It points out that there are problems with our tax code that we should fix. But there are also threats to our climate that we should address.”",[],

Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard and his family are giving away their ownership in the outdoor apparel maker they started five decades ago to benefit climate change. But that does not mean the company is going to become any less competitive or aggressive in meeting its business objectives. ""I think what people fail to understand about Patagonia, both the past and today and the future, is that we are unapologetically a for-profit business,"" CEO Ryan Gellert told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Wednesday. ""We are extremely competitive. The Chouinards are extremely competitive about the business. We focus on making high-quality products, standing behind that product for the usable life of it. We compete with every other company in our space, aggressively. I don't think we have lost that instinct,"" Gellert said. That also means that pay and compensation of employees will not suffer, he said. ""I think this whole thing fails if we don't continue to run a competitive business and included in that is taking care of our people,"" Gellert told CNBC.

The conversations that led to the decision started internally a couple of years ago. If Patagonia had decided to take the company public or sold either a majority or minority stake in the company, ""we had very little confidence in meeting with quite a few potential investors that the integrity of the company would be protected,"" Gellert said. Instead, Patagonia opted to put the shares of the company into two trusts, the Patagonia Purpose Trust, which holds all the voting shares (2% of the total), and the Holdfast Collective, which holds the remaining, nonvoting shares. The Patagonia Purpose trust is dedicated to maintaining the company's values and the Holdfast Collective is a ""nonprofit dedicated to fighting the environmental crisis and defending nature,"" Chouinard wrote in a statement describing the decision. By transferring the overwhelming majority of the company to a social benefit trust, Patagonia avoids paying a large tax bill — an issue which was discussed immediately and loudly on the heels of the announcement that the Chouinard family was giving the company away. Patagonia leadership was expecting the discussion of the tax benefit of their new structure, but tax avoidance was ""never"" part of the decision to give the company away, Gellert said. ""With the family, it was never a conversation in two years,"" the Patagonia CEO said. ""It was not lost on us the tax benefit via the 501c-4,"" which is a designation of an organization that ""must be operated exclusively to promote social welfare"" and is therefore tax exempt, according to the Internal Revenue Service.

""But with the family, it was very clear from the beginning. There were two goals that were focused on: Create a structure that could ensure the integrity and the values of Patagonia and cash flow the environment in more meaningful ways now,"" Gellert said. Gellert pointed out that the Patagonia founding family did pay $17.5 million on the 2 percent of stock that went into the Patagonia Purpose Trust. Patagonia ""has a history of always paying our taxes,"" Gellert said. ""We are a company that very much believes in that. We are a company that has avoided complex structures both in the U.S. and globally to sidestep taxes. We are actually one of the few companies that have lobbied consistently and publicly for higher taxes particularly in support of climate legislation."" Patagonia's decision to donate the majority of the company's profits, which it expects to be approximately $100 million a year, comes amid a fierce debate about how politically and socially active businesses and business leaders should be. Yet, Patagonia has managed to stay popular with both sides of the political divide. Its vests are the defacto uniform for many of the investment and venture capital set. In the annual Axios brand reputation poll, Patagonia does well on both sides of the political divide, ""and that, candidly, is really encouraging and a little bit surprising, because we take positions with the environment at the center consistently and vocally,"" Gellert said. ""What I take away from that is that people respect that we are very consistent."" ""In this world, it is increasingly difficult to fake it,"" Gellert said. ""And so I think that companies that don't have a deep commitment to the things they espouse, I think it falls apart pretty quickly.""","['Catherine Clifford', 'In Catclifford']",2022-09-21 00:00:00

(KOLO) -The outdoor clothing and gear company, Patagonia, is not your regular brand. To help the environment, the Repairs Department at Patagonia gives another life to any of their gear that needs fixing, even their very first items created.

What began as a small group of employees in 1998, the repairs team is now 115 employees strong. 50,000 repairs happen each year in Reno alone. The Reno warehouse fixes around 100,000 items for the Patagonia repair network.

Repairs Manager Josh Schill describes their work as unique and challenging.

“We are repairing anything that was ever made. Sometimes that requires a substitution and other times we have that exact fabric. I don’t even know how many rolls we have in a typical season, but we buy ten thousand to fourteen thousand yards of fabric.”

This team at Patagonia allows customers to keep things in play and avoids people having to throw away a jacket for a messed-up zipper, a hole, or even prevents them from having to buy something new. The Environmental Protection Agency reports each year 85 % of clothing ends up in landfills.

Schill continued,

“We think we have great quality, and we are using our repairs process to do all those things but also take that message and do better in the future with the design and production teams. Our message and what we stand for in our mission. It is integrated into saving the home planet. We understand business comes with a footprint and we are doing everything we can to mitigate that.”

Diego LaRochelle has been in repairs since October. He mentioned sewing is very new for him, but he is learning every day. LaRochelle said why he enjoys the work he does,

“I have an appreciation for older gear, I think about the older gear my dad has handed down to me or the stuff I’ve been lucky to thrift, so, personally it’s been awesome to see old gear that’s been well-used and well-loved to come in and get to go back out and have a second life.”

Manuel mentioned what the best part of the job is,

“The nice thing about repairing something and being reusable is the feeling. It’s about the company’s principles. It’s a very nice feeling to recycle to repair.”

https://fortune.com/2022/09/15/patagonia-founder-yvon-chouinard-what-will-happen-to-his-company-now/,Who is Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard and what happens to the company now?,"“Earth is now our only shareholder.”

This is the tagline for Patagonia’s jaw-dropping move to transfer the entire ownership of the company from the Chouinard family to a nonprofit organization that will spend all profits from Patagonia on combating climate change.

“Hopefully this will influence a new form of capitalism that doesn’t end up with a few rich people and a bunch of poor people,” Yvon Chouinard, the founder of Patagonia, said in an interview with the New York Times on the day of the announcement.

Chouinard has seen his net worth skyrocket over the years as Patagonia sales soared, but has regularly noted that he detests excessive wealth and was looking to offload his any way he could.

Under the new model, Patagonia will—like a typical business—continue to seek to maximize its profits and compete with other outdoor clothing retailers. But the move differentiates Patagonia from other businesses as its profits will go to a trust and nonprofit organization rather than to shareholders who own a stake in the company.

This has rarely been done before—and never at this scale. “Truth be told, there were no good options available. So we created our own,” Chouinard said in a statement.

So how does it work, and what were the other options?

How does the new model work?

The Chouinard family decided to take their shares and sell them to two newly created entities: a nonprofit and a trust.

Patagonia’s entire voting stock, which was once held by the Chouinard family and only represents around 2% of overall shares, was placed in a newly established entity known as the Patagonia Purpose Trust. The entity will be overseen by members of the family and closest advisers and will be in charge of approving key company decisions, such as appointments to the board of directors and changes to the company’s legal charter.

Meanwhile, the remaining 98% of the company, valued at around $3 billion, will go to the Holdfast Collective, whose only responsibility will be to protect the planet. The Holdfast Collective will distribute an annual dividend from any cash that is not reinvested in Patagonia to fight the environmental crisis, protect undeveloped land around the world, and advocate for causes and candidates in politics.

Patagonia will continue to operate in the same fashion—selling about $1 billion annually in jackets, hats, and the famed finance-bro fleece vest made of 100% recycled polyester—but the $100 million of profits that previously went to the Chouinard family each year will now go to the newly established nonprofit organization.

“We are going to give away the maximum amount of money to people who are actively working on saving this planet,” Chouinard told the New York Times.

Why not just sell the company and donate the proceeds to charity?

“One option was to sell Patagonia and donate all the money,” Chouinard wrote in a statement. But, he said, this move would put the future of Patagonia at risk.

“We couldn’t be sure a new owner would maintain our values or keep our team of people around the world employed,” Chouinard wrote.

In a selloff, Patagonia could have ended up in the hands of a private equity company or a large fashion conglomerate, which might fray Patagonia’s vision of treating its workers and the planet with respect.

Why not go public?

“What a disaster that would have been,” wrote Chouinard. Going public would still allow Chouinard to sell off his shares and donate the proceeds to charity, but that would leave the direction of the company to the public market.

“Even public companies with good intentions are under too much pressure to create short-term gain at the expense of long-term vitality and responsibility,” Chouinard wrote.

Who is Yvon Chouinard?

The financial engineering of a deal of this scale is unmatched in creativity, and who else could pull it off than Yvon Chouinard?

A pioneering rock climber in the Yosemite Valley in the 1960s, Chouinard is not the typical unicorn company founder. In his youth, he reportedly lived out of his car and ate damaged cans of cat food. Today he can be found in his modest homes in Ventura and Jackson, Wyo., wearing raggedy old clothes, driving a Subaru, and using neither a cell phone nor a computer.

Chouinard started his career making hardened steel pitons for use in Yosemite Valley in 1957, which he sold from the back of his car to maintain his lifestyle of surfing and climbing. Around 1970, he became aware that the use of steel pitons made by his company, which made up 70% of his income, was causing significant damage to the cracks of Yosemite. In response, he introduced new aluminum chockstones, called Hexentrics and Stoppers, which cannibalized the sales of pitons and led to the further success of his business.

He founded Patagonia in 1973 to reflect his idealistic priorities, and was a first mover in sustainability and stakeholder capitalism. In 2002, Patagonia began giving away 1% of its sales each year to grassroots environmental movements. (This will stay as part of the business model under the new ownership changes, Patagonia said in a statement.)

Then, in 2012, Patagonia became the first company in California to become a certified Benefit Corporation, or B Corp, which is a private certification of for-profit companies of their “social and environmental performance.”

Are there others who have donated their wealth?

According to the New York Times, the only person to do something on this scale is Barre Seid, a Republican donor, who gave away his $1.6 billion electronic company Tripp Lite to a nonprofit run by Leonard Leo, who cochairs the conservative legal group the Federalist Society.

The recipient in that case was a conservative political advocacy group that has been one of the prime architects of conservatives’ efforts to reshape the American judicial system, including by appointing conservative judges to the Supreme Court and increasing funding efforts to stop action on climate change, according to ProPublica.

How does this change capitalism?

The move goes against the traditional Milton Friedman economic theory that the only responsibility of businesses is to generate profits for shareholders. Economists of this school believe that without the incentive to maximize shareholder returns, businesses wouldn’t succeed and might lose focus.

But according to Charles Conn, the chair of Patagonia, “surveys show that most investors believe ESG goals should trump short-term profit, and more than ever, employees and consumers are choosing companies based on what they stand for.”

In an op-ed for Fortune, Conn argues that while shareholder capitalism has brought a lot of good, in the form of the reduction in absolute poverty and longer lives through medical innovation, “let’s be honest: It made its gains at an enormous cost, including increasing inequality and wide-scale uncompensated environmental damage.”

He notes that shareholder capitalism thinks goals other than profit will confuse investors. “Nonsense,” he writes, adding that “over time, the market will continue to work and responsible purpose-led companies will attract more investment, better employees, and deeper customer loyalty.”

“This is not ‘woke’ capitalism,” he writes. “It’s the future of business if we want to build a better world for our children and all other creatures.”",['Sophie Mellor'],2022-09-15 00:00:00

Yvon Chouinard – the founder of the well-known outdoor retailer – announced via an open letter on the company's website that he and his family have given away Patagonia to a non-profit organization and specially developed trust to help combat climate change. Patagonia is worth around $3 billion.

In his message titled ""Earth is now our only shareholder,"" Chouinard, 83, confessed, ""I never wanted to be a businessman.""

Instead, he began his career as a craftsman and created ""climbing gear for my friends"" before entering the apparel industry with Patagonia.

He went on to note the company's mission to help prevent ""global warming and ecological destruction"" by creating eco-friendly clothing and annually donating 1 percent of its sales. It later earned B Corp certification and garnered California benefit corporation status.

Patagonia has since been ""in business to save our home planet.""

Chouinard knew there were few ways to serve this initiative.

""One option was to sell Patagonia and donate all the money,"" he wrote. ""But we couldn't be sure a new owner would maintain our values or keep our team of people around the world employed.""

He added that Patagonia could have also gone public, a move he said would be an inevitable ""disaster.""

""Truth be told, there were no good options available. So, we created our own,"" he explained, adding, ""Instead of ""going public,"" you could say we're ""going purpose."" Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we'll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth.""

Now, the all company's voting stock that was previously owned by his family has been transferred to the newly-formed Patagonia Purpose Trust. The trust will guarantee that the company's vision and morals –– to run sustainable businesses and give away the profits –– stay a priority, according to the outdoor apparel founder.

Despite this generous donation, Chouinard, his wife, and his two adult children are not receiving any tax benefits, instead, they will pay roughly $17.5 million in taxes for the gift, according to The New York Times. The family, along with some advisors, will operate the trust going forward.

In addition to that all of the nonvoting stock, which represents 98 percent of the company's worth, has been handed to the Holdfast Collective, ""a nonprofit dedicated to fighting the environmental crisis and defending nature,"" he said.

""The funding will come from Patagonia: Each year, the money we make after reinvesting in the business will be distributed as a dividend to help fight the crisis,"" Chouinard added.

Though the major change comes 50 years after Patagonia was first launched, its founder proudly said, ""and we are just getting started.""

""If we have any hope of a thriving planet — much less a thriving business — 50 years from now, it is going to take all of us doing what we can with the resources we have. This is another way we've found to do our part.""

He concluded by noting that Earth's ""resources"" have run out, and now is truly the time to save it.

""Hopefully this will influence a new form of capitalism that doesn't end up with a few rich people and a bunch of poor people,"" Chouinard told The New York Times. ""We are going to give away the maximum amount of money to people who are actively working on saving this planet.""","['Charmaine Patterson', 'People Editorial Guidelines']",

Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard saves money wherever he can.

Despite founding a company that prides itself on prioritizing employee wellbeing and sustainability over profits, Chouinard grew up scrimping and saving during his career as a professional rock climber.

Patagonia, which he founded in 1973, is now worth $3 billion. In September, Chouinard announced plans to give away the outdoor-apparel retailer to a trust and nonprofit.

Chouinard lived an unusual lifestyle in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, in part because the nature of living in the wilderness as a climber and in beach shacks as a surfer deprived him of modern comforts, and in part because of a desire to save money, especially during the early days of Patagonia.

Here are some of his wackiest budget tactics during the earlier years of his life, as recounted in his 2005 autobiography ""Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman.""

As a young adult, Chouinard had to adapt his life to the great outdoors so that he would get the best opportunities for climbing and surfing. For example, in 1957, Chouinard and his friends lived in a hut on the beach in San Blas, Mexico, for a month, eating fish and tropical fruit, and using candles from the local church to wax their surfboards, he wrote.

He also got gas money ""by diving into trash cans and redeeming soda pop bottles"" in the late 1950s. ""One time I found an entire freezer load of partially frozen meat,"" he added.

Before founding Patagonia, Chouinard made a living selling climbing equipment from the back of his car. ""The profits were slim, though,"" he wrote. ""For weeks at a time I'd live on fifty cents to a dollar a day.""

One year he and a friend bought a couple of cases of damaged cans of cat food in San Francisco and took those out to the Rockies for the summer, where their diet consisted of oatmeal, potatoes, ground squirrel, blue grouse, and porcupines they killed with an ice ax, he said.

It wasn't just food that he saved money on.

When traveling with his friends in the late 1950s, ""we were always sick from the bad water and couldn't afford medicine,"" he said. He said that they would take charcoal from the campfire, mix it with a half cup of salt in a glass of water, and drink the mixture so that they would vomit. Over time he gradually gained natural ""immunity"" to poor-quality water, he claimed

Even as his business grew, Chouinard continued to minimize both personal and business costs.

In 1966, Chouinard set up a base for his equipment business, Chouinard Equipment, in a rented tin boiler room of an abandoned packing company slaughterhouse in California. The company's first retail store was in an ""ugly tin shed"" decorated with old wood, he wrote.

Chouinard had some unorthodox living arrangements, too.

""I slept two hundred days a year or more in my old army-surplus sleeping bag,"" he wrote. ""I didn't buy a tent until I was almost forty, preferring to sleep under boulders and the low-hanging branches of an alpine fir.""

In the early 1970s, he and his wife lived in a beach shack for half the year and spent the summer months in the back of an old van until his wife converted the basement under their retail store into a makeshift apartment.

Even now, Chouinard still wears old clothes, drives a rundown Subaru, and has two modest homes in California and Wyoming, The New York Times reported. He doesn't even own a computer or cellphone, according to the publication.",['Grace Dean'],2022-12-26 00:00:00
https://www.climbing.com/news/two-climbers-die-patagonia/,"Two Climbers Die on Descent From Cerro Chaltén, Patagonia","Heading out the door? Read this article on the new Outside+ app available now on iOS devices for members! Download the app.

On January 19, Basque climbers Amaia Agirre, 31, and Iker Bilbao, 29, were killed while descending Cerro Chaltén (Fitz Roy) when a large, wet avalanche swept them into a crevasse. They had successfully climbed the Afanassieff (5.10; 5,000ft) and had rappelled La Brecha de los Italianos—a gully notorious for its falling rock, ice, and snow— before pausing on the glacier below to reorder their equipment. It was during this break that an avalanche released from the steep snow slopes below La Brecha, dragging Agirre and Bilbao into the crevasse. The third member of their party, Josu Linaza, ran perpendicular to the avalanche’s path and was not buried. Due to the high avalanche danger and the team’s ropes now buried in the crevasse, Linaza did not attempt to dig them out.

Linaza hiked for four hours before reaching a group of climbers who could call for a rescue via their Inreach. The message was sent to the unofficial rescue team of the area, the El Chaltén Alpine Rescue Centre, of which Dr. Carolina Codó is the leader. The team met to discuss the situation, aware that they were at least six hours from the accident site, and that the chances of survival while being buried in an avalanche would drop dramatically over time.

“Death by suffocation and hypothermia is inevitable,” Codó wrote to Climbing in an email (translated from Spanish). “Therefore, we evaluated that the [rescue team] volunteers could not be risked when the chances of survival were zero.”

Professional climber Jacob Cook was bivvied on the summit of Cerro Chaltén when he received news of the accident. The following morning, Cook and his partners descended the Franco-Argentina and then waited all day above La Brecha for its sun-baked walls to go into the shade, providing safer conditions to descend. Cook feared for wet avalanches, like the one that took Agirre and Bilbao, as well as for La Brecha itself.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by hermanospou (@hermanospou)

La Brecha used to be a gully filled with low-angle ice which held together loose rock. Now, rising temperatures have all but erased the ancient ice and have left a dangerous shooting gallery in its wake. Cook described several climbers who have had close calls in the gully recently: a friend’s leg was broken by a falling rock, and another friend had refrigerator-sized blocks fly past him while rappelling. And in February 2022, John Bolte was killed by rockfall while rappelling La Brecha.

When Cook reached La Brecha’s accident scene roughly 33 hours after the avalanche, he was struck by how unfortunate Agirre and Bilbao had been. “It’s a very dangerous place but they were also extremely unlucky to be where they were when that happened,” Cook said. “It seems unbelievably unlucky, like they could have been five meters to the left and probably survived.”

Cook blames climate change for Cerro Chaltén–and other Patagonian mountains—becoming more hazardous in recent years: high day-time temperatures can produce destructive wet avalanches and cause loose blocks to effectively unfreeze from alpine walls. Climbing Cerro Chaltén has become especially dangerous, Cook said, because La Brecha is still the best way off the peak. “There just isn’t a good descent from the mountain right now,” he said. “It’s definitely a problem facing [climbers] in El Chaltén.”

Other options include descending the North (Goretta) Pillar via the Casarotto, which is unappealing for climbers who’ve summited via the Afanassieff as they will be rappelling more steep, technical terrain than the Franco-Argentina/La Brecha descent. There is also the Royal Flush descent, but Cook does not recommend it for its similarly serious nature: it’s the biggest face on Cerro Chaltén at 3,000 feet. “Especially onsight, you’d be rapping into an extremely committing situation,” he said.

Eneko Pou, a frequent Patagonia climber and friend of Agirre, said Agirre and Bilbao were talented young alpinists with promising futures. Pou did not know Bilbao personally, but knew he was a well-respected alpinist and a career firefighter. According to Pou, Agirre was one of the strongest alpinists in Spain and had “a lot of talent doing almost everything, a lot of specialties.” She’d climbed 5.12+ and WI 6, and went on several expeditions, including Nepal in 2021, where she participated as a medic on a new route up Chekigo’s south face. Agirre also did the first female ascent of Groucho Marx (5.10d A3; 2,460ft) in Chamonix and was a member of the National Women’s Mountaineering Team of the Spanish Federation of Mountain Sports and Climbing.

https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2023/03/09/patagonia-acquires-like-minded-climate-smart-cracker-start-up,Patagonia acquires like-minded climate smart cracker start-up,"Moonshot – founded two years ago by Julia Collins – produces carbon-neutral crackers.

It works with wheat farmers in Washington State who grow organically – avoiding petroleum-based fertilizers and chemical pesticides – using regenerative practices like planting cover crops, reducing tillage and rotating crops to build up healthy microbes in the soil and potentially sequester more carbon.

The wheat is traceable to the field and all in the supply chain – from farmer to miller and the manufacturer – are based within 100 miles of each other, resulting in a lower carbon footprint.

Moonshot also uses renewable energy in a LEED-certified facility, while its recyclable packaging is made with 100% recycled materials.

Shooting for the moon

Julia Collins

“I founded Moonshot with the vision of using the power of food to help tackle climate change,”​ said Collins, noting the company was named to emulate its mission is to ‘shoot for the moon by taking a bite out of climate change, one cracker at a time.’

Taking it one step further, Collins built a platform called Planet FWD, helping other companies and brands to do the same.

""To us, it's not one action, but taking a full inventory of your company's impact on the planet so you can holistically evaluate where you can make adjustments and drive change. It all starts with measuring your baseline carbon footprint so you can create an action plan from there and track progress year over year,”​ said Collins.

Owned by the Earth

Sausalito-based Patagonia Provision, too, sources ingredients that rebuild soil, protect the heath of ocean ecosystems and protect the environment.

It was one of the first companies to partner with the Rodale Institute in support of Regenerative Organic Certification. Its parent company – a certified B-Corporation – stopped providing branded clothing to companies that damaged the environment and takes back used Patagonia apparel for upcycling into other products in its ReCrafted Collection.

Last year, Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard and family shareholders transferred their ownership to the Holdfast Collective, a nonprofit dedicated to preserving the planet.

“Instead of going public, you could say we’re going purpose. Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth,”​ said Chouinard on the company’s website.

Collins said, “By joining Patagonia Provisions – which recently made Earth its only shareholder – Moonshot now belongs to the planet. I cannot imagine a more spectacular path forward for our mission, our team and our climatarian community.” ​

Added Paul Lightfoot, Patagonia Provisions’ GM, “Moonshot has achieved impressive growth by producing and selling delicious and nutritious crackers with a materially improved carbon footprint compared to industry standard practices.​

“Moonshot’s values and mission are strongly aligned with Patagonia Provisions, which made it easy to warmly welcome their people onto our team.”​

Wake-up call

This acquisition – Patagonia’s first in more than 20 years – is part of its strategy to boost its food division, investing in like-minded businesses and products.

“Patagonia doesn’t always follow conventional thinking,”​ said Lightfoot.

“We are, at heart, still a gear and apparel company, but [our] mission is really simple and clear – to save our planet. Yvon and the rest of the leadership team believe that food should be the most important lever that we can pull toward fulfilling that mission.​

“There are a lot of consumers out there who want to make choices that make them feel like they’ve [play] a role. That’s going to create one of the greatest market demand opportunities for food companies.”​

He added, “We think there’s no better way to serve a wake-up call to the food industry than to watch their market share dwindle toward food that’s better for the planet.”​

Patagonia’s NPD team, for example, is experimenting with kernza – a perennial grain with long roots that can help build soil health and helps to capture carbon from the air – used to make items like beer and pasta.

However, not every experiment goes smoothly: it wanted to use breadfruit because of its environmental and social benefits, but eventually discontinued a line of breadfruit crackers because of quality issues.

Moonshot’s crackers will join Patagonia’s 28-strong F&B portfolio – with items like smoked mackerel, dried mango and kelp salsa – sold online and in retail like Whole Foods across the US.

Growth strategy

Lightfood believes the F&B division will grow quickly and will eventually rival the apparel side.

“We think that anywhere there are parts of the food system that are extractive and destructive, we have a role to play in creating a counterbalancing set of food products that are regenerative,”​ he said.

“We don’t seek growth for its own sake. But we recognise that to have an impact, we have to scale. So this probably will be a part of the company that grows a lot over the next 5 to 10 years.”​",['Gill Hyslop'],2023-03-09 00:00:00

Brands are borrowing from Patagonia’s playbook for Black Friday and beyond.

The 50-year-old outdoor apparel company, which has long been the poster brand for environmental and social responsibility, has a history of pioneering disruptive initiatives for Black Friday. This year, its influence was apparent as brands released their shopping holiday plans.

In 2011, Patagonia ran a full-page “Don’t buy this jacket” ad in the New York Times, urging people to buy less and more thoughtfully. This year, sneaker brand Cariuma, among others, is opting out of running a Black Friday promotion hoping to send the same message. In 2013, Patagonia urged consumers to repair what they own rather than buy new. Likewise, fashion brands Freitag, Mud Jeans and Raeburn are closing their e-commerce sites on Black Friday, while hosting anti-consumption events like clothing swaps and repair workshops. And in 2016, Patagonia donated all of its profits from the shopping holiday to grassroots environmental groups, which equated to $10 million. On a smaller scale, custom accessories brand Stoney Clover Lane has announced that, on Giving Tuesday, it will donate 100% of its net profits from a dedicated collection to nonprofit Salood.

“Patagonia leads the way in sustainability, which is admirable,” said Mollie Hughes, CEO of sustainable shopping platform Softly. “But sustainable brands can participate in Black Friday discounts while still encouraging responsible consumption.”

Of course, Patagonia’s against-the-grain, often shocking moves haven’t been confined to the holiday season. In September, the company’s founder, Yvon Chouinard, made waves when he and his family simply transferred their ownership of the company, valued at $3 billion, to a nonprofit. Moving forward, the organization will ensure that 100% of Patagonia’s profits, estimated to be $100 million per year, are used to protect the environment.

Thanks to the rise of the conscious consumer and also social media providing consumers with new access to brands, brands’ values, ethics and processes are under the microscope like never before. Still, brands that authentically put the environment at the center of their mission are a rare breed. But Laura May Gibbs, founder and creative director of 8-year-old Australian activewear brand Nagnata, is among those leading with a Chouinard mindset.

“What Patagonia has done is incredible,” said Gibbs. “That’s my vision for Nagnata in the next 20 years: to have a business that purely funds environmental programs and communities dedicated to combating environmental issues.”

More brands have received B Corp certification, following Patagonia in confirming their commitments to sustainability, quality working conditions, diversity and inclusion. Since 2016, that’s included the aforementioned Cariuma, as well as Toms, Allbirds, fashion brand Another Tomorrow, underwear brand TomboyX and Anuka Jewelry, among others.

To date, Nagnata has been fully funded by Gibbs, despite many investment offers. A big reason is that Gibbs wants to uphold Nagnata’s dedication to charity work and community work without feeling pressure to justify it. “From others’ point of view, I don’t always make the best decisions, but part of Nagnata’s beauty is that we’re a very human brand; we prioritize community,” she said.

Gibbs plays by her own rules in situations across the board. For example, she strictly works with wholesale partners that allow for the long lead times the brand’s sustainable production processes require. And she’s prioritized product over marketing since deciding to launch the brand around a unique concept: a long-lasting, age-inclusive brand of yoga studio-to-street styles made from natural fibers. To test her vision, she linked with Australia’s knitwear manufacturers, driven by their no-waste production processes. And she made merino wool a signature of the brand, after realizing the challenge of making performance wear out of other natural materials. It took her two years to develop Nagnata’s first sellable pieces.

“I’ve been working in fashion since I was 19, traveling to a lot of factories and mills, and seeing the pollution in the waterways and the denim factories,” said Gibbs. “The more I found out about the industry, the more I realized that it wasn’t married with my belief system.”

Gibbs acknowledged that producing new fashion of any kind cannot be called sustainable. As such, she calls her focus “sustainably-minded design.”

“I want to do the best I can do, in every part of the process, by considering everything down to the fabric choice,” she said. She added that, other than some organic cotton used to make a small T-shirt collection, Nagnata has used zero ready-made fabrics. And it continues to work toward its goal of using 100% natural fibers — it will get there by the end of 2023, according to Gibbs. For now, some recycled synthetics are used to facilitate stretch.

Gibbs said Nagnata caters to the wellness-focused lifestyles of both people in its headquarters of Byron Bay, Australia and people in Los Angeles. Of course, like sustainability, wellness was prioritized across regions during the height of the pandemic. That served the brand well: In 2020, its sales doubled.

Nagnata has only recently started advertising, on digital channels. Prior, it had relied on organic growth driven by beautiful, approachable and relatable imagery by photographer friends of Gibbs, as well as messaging showcasing its values. In addition, Gibbs’ strong reputation within the Australian fashion industry, having worked as a designer for Alice McCall, for one, earned the brand local press.

What has really helped to catapult the brand, however, have been its big stockists of Net-a-Porter and Lane Crawford, both secured early on. Gibbs attends the biannual buyers’ markets in New York and Paris. And, typically, she splits her time between Australia and Los Angeles.

The company’s U.S. business is growing, currently accounting for 20% of its revenue. So, setting up a dedicated e-commerce site and third-party logistics in the U.S. is a priority. And next week, it will host a pop-up in L.A. — it plans to open an L.A. store in the future.

As for other stores, Nagnata upgraded from a makeshift storefront to a first permanent store, in Byron Bay, Australia, earlier this month. Next, Gibbs wants to open a store in Sydney.

Currently, Nagnata’s corporate team is made up of six employees, plus it has an L.A.-based COO and two business advisors who act as CEOs, Gibbs said. Nagnata also employs a retail staff.

Moving forward, Gibbs wants to grow Nagnata’s emerging men’s business and build on Nagnata’s product assortment — based on the shoppers’ demands, it’s been evolving to look more like traditional ready-to-wear, Gibbs said. It’s already introduced knit sweaters and, in February, it will debut outerwear and a ski collection. According to Gibbs, Nagnata’s Net-a-Porter sales spiked after Gibbs convinced buyers to feature the brand’s styles in categories beyond activewear.

From now on, the corporation’s profits will fund efforts to deal with climate change as well as to protect wilderness areas. It will, however, remain a privately held enterprise. According to initial reports about this unusual approach to philanthropy that ran on September 15, 2022, Patagonia is worth aboutS$3 billion, and its profits, which will be donated in perpetuity, could total $100 million every year.

The Conversation U.S. asked Indiana University’s Ash Enrici — a scholar who studies how philanthropy affects the environment — to explain why this arrangement is so significant.

Is This Move Part of a Trend?

The biggest donors, those giving away billions of dollars, are increasingly making climate change a priority. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for example, announced in 2020 that he was putting $10 billion into his Earth Fund, and Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, said in 2021 that she would devote $3.5 billion of her fortune to fighting climate change.

Likewise, big donors are increasing their funding of conservation efforts.

In September 2021, the Earth Fund joined with eight other philanthropic powerhouses to pledge $5 billion to “support the creation, expansion, management, and monitoring of protected and conserved areas of land, inland water, and sea” around the world. This initiative aims to conserve 30 percent of Earth by 2030.

Within days of Chouinard’s announcement, another splashy climate gift emerged, setting a similar precedent. Filmmaker Adam McKay said he will donate $4 million. Those proceeds from his satirical film, which was a metaphor regarding climate inaction, will fund climate activism.

No matter how frequently these donations occur, it’s important to keep in mind that the cost of meeting the world’s environmental challenges is enormous and will cost trillions of dollars. So while all of these gifts are certainly significant in their scale, donors and governments will need to do and spend much more.

What Makes It Stand Out?

What’s unusual about Chouinard’s climate-change gift is its structure. By giving away his company and directing that the profits be spent fighting climate change in the long term in the form of regular installments, he is creating a new model for large-scale donations.

ADVERTISEMENT

It also sets a notable precedent. Chouinard and his family are giving away the source of their wealth and setting things up in a way that is going to result in a predictable form of support for work on climate issues — an estimated $100 million each year from Patagonia’s profits.

I think it’s a great example for other business owners and very wealthy people to follow.

How Are Conservation and Climate Change Efforts Connected?

Journalists, scholars, and the public often treat addressing climate change and conserving ecosystems as two distinct priorities. But they are instead closely related. Having ecosystems thrive in a way that protects biodiversity is a way to slow the pace of climate change.

Climate change itself will harm ecosystems and contribute to the loss of biodiversity through, for example, raising temperatures in large bodies of water to the point where established marine ecosystems become so disrupted that many species die off.

And the flip side of that is that maintaining healthy ecosystems can help counter climate change. For example, mangroves are often cut down for shrimp farming and other industries. But protecting them offers the potential to retain as much or more carbon as tropical rain forests, while also safeguarding the animals and plants on the land and in the water.

What Do You Think This Money Should Fund?

To me, how they — the newly minted Patagonia Purpose Trust, which will own and run the company, and the Holdfast Collective, the nonprofit funded by Patagonia’s profits — operate will be just as important as what they fund.

ADVERTISEMENT

Based on research I’m engaged in, I believe that they can do more good by reflecting on how they work, hopefully in ways that are both equitable and effective. For example, they can consider highly collaborative approaches, incorporate flexibility for adapting circumstances and long-term funding to match ecological timescales. It’s also essential that Indigenous people living in the places affected by environmental work have a say and are heard.

Because the Holdfast Collective is a social-welfare group, rather than a charity, it will be free to emphasize policy reform — which I think should be a major priority.

Government and international aid agencies are often too constrained by bureaucracy to be able to adapt and adjust their practices in a way that might be needed to address urgent environmental challenges.

Philanthropists are more free in terms of how they work. That means funders like Patagonia’s trust can provide seed money to jump-start new initiatives that later may be more heavily funded and scaled up by governments.

Why Are Many People Troubled by Gifts Like This?

In recent years, scrutiny of philanthropy of all kinds has been on the rise. Some of the criticism takes aim at big donors, like Bezos, whose sources of wealth contribute to the problems their gifts are supposed to be solving.

Concerns about how philanthropy can perpetuate or excuse discrimination and oppression are also growing, leading to calls for its “decolonization.”

Even avid environmentalists are expressing deep concerns about the potential downsides of this new model. They’re asking whether it might be used to fund causes championed by other wealthy donors with starkly different agendas.

Regardless of what concerns you may have about what the Chouinard family decided to do, or regarding other billion-dollar donations that take aim at climate change, one thing is for sure: The cost of doing nothing at all will surely be much higher than taking action, however imperfectly.","['Jean-Marc Giboux', 'Liaison Agency', 'Getty Images', 'Ash Enrici Is An Assistant Professor Of Philanthropic Studies Indiana University.']",2022-09-26 13:41:38.557000

The news caps a fitting end to the trail-blazing rock climber’s unconventional business career. As one of the best-known outdoor clothing and gear brands, Patagonia could easily go public. Chouinard could also find a willing buyer. Or, he could simply retire, retain his ownership and keep the $3 billion business in the family.

Instead, Chouinard, 83, and his family are shifting their stake in the company to Patagonia Purpose Trust and a nonprofit called Holdfast Collective, which will redirect the company’s annual profits toward environmental causes.

“Earth is now our only shareholder,” Chouinard wrote in an open letter published Wednesday. “Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth.”

Holdfast Collective is organized as a 501(c)4 corporation, according to The New York Times, which first reported the news. That structure has attracted wide criticism in recent years because it allows nonprofits to spend untaxed donations to influence politics while concealing donors’ names.

But the decision also reflects Chouinard’s open disdain for politicians he dismisses as “climate deniers.” During the 2020 election, Patagonia sold clothes with tags reading “vote the assholes out,” referring to politicians who downplay the threat of climate change.

“You’ve got the Koch family and the fossil-fuel companies: They’re going to be influencing the elections,” Chouinard told Fast Company in a 2019 interview. “We’ve got to do the same thing.”

Born to a French-Canadian family in Maine, Chouinard grew up aspiring to become a fur trapper. He learned to navigate the mountains while hunting coots and rabbits with falcons. As a young man, he joined a trail-blazing group of big wall rock climbers in Yosemite National Park, gaining notoriety for a nine-day first ascent of El Capitán’s North American Wall.

He entered the world of business as a self-taught blacksmith making hand-forged pitons – the spikes that climbers at the time used to support themselves while climbing up vertical walls.

Despite a self-proclaimed anti-capitalist streak, Patagonia – his second major company – catapulted Chouinard into the billionaire class.

In recent years, however, he has increasingly sought ways to use the company and its profits to champion his lifelong love of the outdoors. Patagonia has bankrolled documentaries and books extolling the virtues of wild fish and casting an unflattering spotlight on the hatcheries that dilute their genetics.

Arguing that organic doesn’t do enough to offset the extractive damage of industrial farming, Patagonia has embraced regenerative agriculture for both fiber and food products. The company set an aggressive goal to become carbon neutral by 2025.

The daughter of AFAR digital content director Laura Dannen Redman practically lived in her Patagonia down bunting through four months of rain, snow, and sleet (“like she was a tiny postal worker”). Redman says it was perfect for playing in the snow, even without boots—the foldover mitts and foot coverings did the job. “I was surprised by how comfortable she seemed in less frigid temps,” Redman says. “It is down, so keep that in mind if your kids have a hint of an allergy.” It’s made with a recycled nylon shell and recycled down (reclaimed from other down products).

It was an understated clip unveiling an unprecedented move: Chouinard is giving away his company to an entity that will steer all profits into climate solutions.

The move will funnel $100 million a year into climate-positive investments, make Patagonia a powerful force in climate philanthropy and establish a new model for corporate sustainability.

Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard and his family—who made a ten-figure fortune from his outdoor outfitter empire—have relinquished their ownership of the 49-year-old company, transferring it to trusts and nonprofit organizations and pledging Wednesday to redirect Patagonia’s future profits toward fighting climate change.

Key Facts

All of the company’s nonvoting shares—or 98% of total shares—are now owned by a new organization called the Holdfast Collective, a 501(c)(4) that Patagonia says will use every dollar not reinvested into the company to support nature and biodiversity and to “fight the environmental crisis.” (Patagonia has already donated $50 million.) The company’s voting shares are now owned by the Patagonia Purpose Trust, another new entity the company says will “enshrine Patagonia’s purpose and values” and “demonstrate as a for-profit business that capitalism can work for the planet.” Depending on Patagonia’s performance, the company projects it could pay out to the Holdfast Collective an annual dividend of about $100 million—the organization hasn’t specified how it plans on using the money. Chouinard wrote in an open letter that he considered selling the company and donating the proceeds or even going public, but he decided to transfer its ownership to keep the company’s workers employed and maintain Patagonia’s values. Ryan Gellert will stay on as chief executive, and the Chouinard family will continue to sit on Patagonia’s board, the company said.

Crucial Quote

“Hopefully this will influence a new form of capitalism that doesn’t end up with a few rich people and a bunch of poor people,” Chouinard told the New York Times, which first reported the news. “We are going to give away the maximum amount of money to people who are actively working on saving this planet.”

Forbes Valuation

We estimated Chouinard to be worth $1.2 billion before he relinquished control of the company. He is no longer a billionaire.

Surprising Fact

The Chouinard family’s decision to give up the company was partly set in motion when Forbes listed Chouinard as a billionaire, he told the New York Times. His inclusion on the list “really pissed me off,” he said, because he didn’t have $1 billion in the bank and doesn’t “drive Lexuses.” Forbes first included Chouinard in its lists in 2017 based on the value of Patagonia, not the cash in his bank account.

Key Background

Chouinard, who founded Patagonia in 1973, is a longtime environmentalist, and for years his company has donated 1% of sales to grassroots activists. The company was one of a handful that continued to pay employees amid Covid-19 store closures, and in 2018 Patagonia donated an additional $10 million to organizations fighting climate change, a sum it said it saved after former President Donald Trump lowered the corporate tax rate, which the company called “irresponsible.” Last year, Patagonia announced the company would stop selling its popular vests with corporate logos because their inclusion in a design “reduces the life span of a garment, often by a lot, for trivial reasons.” In 2011, Patagonia ran a Black Friday ad in the New York Times asking customers not to buy its products, and to instead reuse or repair items they already own.

In a jam-packed events calendar, Patagonia hosted a morning activism run that saw 150 attendees on Saturday for SXSW, followed by an in-store coffee bar, breakfast, repairs and screen-printing workshop.

The trio of repair technicians representing “Worn Wear” — Patagonia’s branded resale platform — saw a handful of customers drop by the repair table in the back of the South Congress retail store for minor mends. The setup was complete with tatted-up sewing machines, notions, spare fabrics and stickers with “If It’s Broke, Fix It” and other kitschy slogans, as well as a repair handbook, which is an extension of Patagonia’s ironclad repair ethos.

“Art is special but there’s a place in the world for craftspeople,” said Anne Graham, a Patagonia Worn Wear repair technician, while fixing a hole in a jacket pocket at the event. Graham has been with Patagonia’s repair center since 2015. Technicians Claire Beaumont and Evan Franz were also in town from the West Coast conducting repairs at SXSW and raved of the service from an employee viewpoint.

In another sustainability-billed event, ethical retailer Fashionkind and luxury resort Auberge hosted an intimate cocktail gathering at the Commodore Perry Estate, Auberge Resorts Collection last Saturday. The event drew namesakes such as Judy Greer and Stacy London, among others.

The second-largest retailer in the world, Amazon, also made a sustainability play. The e-commerce giant partnered with thrift marketplace platform Goodfair to hand out SXSW-themed merch printed on thrifted denim jackets from Goodfair.

Together, the teams gave out more than 2,000 jackets across three days at an Amazon Prime event. Additionally, six artists were on site customizing jackets for attendees.

“This partnership is significant for several reasons,” Topper Luciani, founder of Goodfair, said to WWD. “First, Amazon is known for owning every supply chain except this one. It’s exciting to see them work with a company that aligns with their customers’ values around sustainability and ethical fashion. Additionally, the younger, hipper crowd at SXSW resonates more with sustainability and thrifting. This move shows that Amazon is listening to their audience and making efforts to meet their demands.”",['Kaley Roshitsh'],2023-03-15 21:23:22+00:00
https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/patagonia-sues-gap-allegedly-copying-172423732.html,Patagonia Sues Gap For Allegedly Copying Its Snap-T Pullover Fleece and Logo,"Patagonia, Inc. has filed a new lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for Northern California against Gap, Inc. for the allegedly infringing on multiple trademarks.

In the complaint, filed last week, Patagonia alleged that Gap is selling copies of its Snap-T pullover fleece that utilized a “highly similar” rectangular logo that resembles its “P-6” mountain skyline logo, first used in 1973. The outdoor company added in the filing that these Gap products are designed to “make it appear” as though Patagonia is the source of Gap’s products or has collaborated with Gap or authorized use of its trademark and trade dress.

More from Footwear News

Patagonia wrote in the complaint that Gap’s Infringements “mimic all elements” of the Snap-T trade dress and use a rectangular logo that, particularly in the context of the infringing trade dress, is “likely to cause confusion” among consumers about the source of the products or whether they are the result of a sponsorship by or collaboration with Patagonia.

“The Gap infringements have caused or are likely to cause dilution of Patagonia’s famous and distinctive mark by diminishing its distinctiveness and singular association with Patagonia,” the company said. “Given how derivative the Gap Infringements are of Patagonia’s original designs and logo, there is no question that Gap’s copying has been willful and deliberate.”

The company went further to highlight a Gap customer review left on the Gap.com website under the alleged infringed product. “I had to zoom in just to ensure that the logo was Gap,” the review said. “This is wild, why are you copying other brands, you have your own lane.”

Patagonia went on to state that unlike this one review, not all consumers will zoom in, either at point of sale or post-sale. “And even if consumers do zoom in, they are likely to believe this is one of Gap’s many collaborations,” the complaint said.

Story continues

Ultimately, Patagonia is seeking damages and lost profits from Gap in an amount proven at trial. The B-Corp. also wants Gap to turn over all existing inventory of the alleged infringed product as well as prohibit Gap from further infringement on its products or logos.

This new claim follows Patagonia’s October trademark infringement, copyright infringement and unfair competition lawsuit against Walmart. In the complaint, Patagonia alleged that both Walmart and New York-based lifestyle apparel brand Robin Ruth USA produced and sold apparel bearing what Patagonia called “nearly identical” copies of its P-6 Trout logo and artwork, replacing the “Patagonia” trademark with the word “Montana.”

https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/10/4/patagonias-profitable-philanthropist-cant-fix-the-planet,Patagonia’s philanthropy won’t fix – and might hurt – the planet,"Giving back is fine. Not taking so much from the planet and its people in the first place is what would really help.

In September, Patagonia’s billionaire founder Yvon Chouinard grabbed headlines after announcing that he was giving away his company to a trust that will use its profits to combat climate change.

Chouinard joins the growing ranks of the megarich “giving back” to causes they care about. Warren Buffet has pledged to give 99 percent of his money to charitable causes before he dies. Bill and Melinda Gates have similarly donated $65.6bn through their foundation, and so have 230 of the world’s most affluent who have joined The Giving Pledge to give away their money before or at their deaths as philanthropy.

The richest 0.1 percent have a combined wealth of more than $50 trillion (PDF). The richest 1 percent have an accumulated wealth worth $222 trillion. That is almost half the world’s total money.

With all of this wealth available over the next few years, the planet’s problems – poverty, preventable diseases, hunger, biodiversity loss, carbon emissions and more – should soon be solved. Right?

Unfortunately, while these billionaires are generously donating large sums of money, they are, in the creation of that wealth in the first place, failing to achieve the core goal of philanthropy – to promote the health, happiness and wellbeing of others. Their approach takes the gold out of the ground from under people and then gives a part of it back to them. Literally.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is a nonprofit fighting poverty, disease and inequity around the world. However, Microsoft – where the Gates made their money – has, alongside Apple, Google and Amazon, been accused of using gold in its products mined illegally from Indigenous territory in Brazil’s Amazon forests.

Illegal gold mining in Brazil is known to increase crime, poverty, malaria and other diseases while destroying sources of clean water, subsistence foods, traditional livelihoods and cultural practices for Indigenous communities. These Indigenous groups, which protect key biodiversity hotspots and carbon sinks, could ironically benefit from some of the Gates Foundation’s donations to guard their territories against invasion from the very firms that supply Microsoft with gold.

These hypocrisies are not unique. Jeff Bezos created a $10bn fund to address climate change while Amazon reported emitting 71 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2021 – more than the entire annual emissions of countries like Portugal, Ireland and Singapore.

Indeed, where there is great suffering, there are often great profits.

Chouinard’s open letter states that “instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth, we are using the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source”. While that may be preferable to buying mega yachts, Patagonia is still “extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth”. The wealth that Chouinard controls.

While I truly believe Chouinard, an environmentalist and activist, has and will continue to funnel this wealth into impactful on-the-ground conservation and climate projects, this in itself may be a problem.

Concerned citizens are misled into thinking that more sales will save the planet. During Patagonia’s 2012 “Don’t buy this jacket” campaign, sales rose 30 percent. Patagonia’s 2016 Black Friday pledge to give all revenue from that day to environmental protection groups led to five times higher sales than the company’s estimates, reaching $10m. The company called it a “fundraiser for the earth”.

Here is the problem: these campaigns all promote increased consumption and thus extraction of value from nature with the misunderstood message that creating more profits will better “protect the source”. Yet three out of five garments produced globally end up in a landfill within a year.

While Patagonia’s new structure ensures the company’s annual net profits of more than $100m will support climate and environmental initiatives, what does this represent in terms of unnecessary production and consumption? Have the true costs to the environment, climate and society been accounted for and will those profits repair the environmental and social damage of the production and consumption?

The generous donations of billions of dollars are only possible through the accumulation of even larger sums of monetary profits. Greater profits are created by taking something, like nature, for free, or by undervaluing something, like human labour. Everything that profit stands for was mined or farmed or grown or crafted, taking the energy of the earth, humans or other living creatures and turning it into products and services.

Philanthropy, even in the trillions, will never fully repair the damage inflicted by the continual pursuit of profits. The impact goes unaccounted for and value gets lost in the transfers between revenues and reparation.

The profitable philanthropist approach to solving the world’s problems separates the goal of promoting the welfare of others from the accumulation of enough money to generously donate. Such philanthropists are happy to donate the money they have already made, but refuse to slow down and lose out on money they have not yet made.

Chouinard’s decision is already inspiring others among the world’s wealthiest to give more, sooner and in a smarter way. Within a day of the Patagonia founder’s announcement, Lululemon’s billionaire boss Chip Wilson pledged $76m for conservation in Canada. Are we to applaud billionaires for figuring out how to efficiently exploit their fellow citizens, our earthly home and our political systems to accumulate more money than they can even spend within their lifetime – because they then give away what they cannot use?

If these billionaires invested less of their energy towards building profitable multinational corporations, massive investment portfolios and savings accounts, they may have less money to donate but might actually create more wellbeing.

Chouinard’s letter ends by reminding us that the Earth’s resources are not infinite, and it is clear we have exceeded its limits. Yet, Patagonia’s profits continue to grow year on year.

Instead of distributing dividends and reinvesting revenues, what about stopping production at the point of profit? Let us bring back the “Don’t buy this jacket” campaign, with a twist. Instead of placing the responsibility on citizens to stop consumption, we need a “Don’t produce this jacket campaign”. Lowering production and consumption lessens the exploitation of the natural world and human labour, and the need for such large-scale philanthropy in the first place.

If these leaders truly want to do business better, promote the welfare of others, shift the mindset of the world’s most affluent and actually address the root causes of the world’s most pressing problems they would limit the growth of their bank accounts and their businesses.

Giving back the gold is great, but leaving it in the ground would really change the system and save our planet.

Most of Patagonia’s shares—98%—are going to a nonprofit, meaning that Chouinard will not have to pay taxes on that gift.

Quartz spoke to New York University law professor Daniel Hemel about the Chouinards’ decision, what separates it from a recent maneuver by a conservative billionaire, and what initial media coverage got wrong.

Do you see the Patagonia announcement as an act of philanthropy, an act of tax avoidance, or something in the middle?

It’s all of the above. The family is using Patagonia to make the world a better place. They are also doing it in a tax-advantaged way. They’re taking advantage of a feature of the tax law that lots and lots and lots of philanthropists take advantage of. When an exempt organization receives dividends or sells appreciated stock, the exempt organization doesn’t pay taxes. And that’s true for public charities, private foundations, and also 501(c)(4)s.

The Chouinards are not claiming an income tax deduction in the same way that the 10% of Americans who itemize get a tax deduction when they give to charity. A lot of the big-time philanthropy— whether it’s going to a (c)(3) [a typical nonprofit charity] or a (c)(4)—that deduction matters only a bit in the big scheme of things because many philanthropists have already figured out ways to minimize their income tax liability. When Warren Buffett gives Berkshire Hathaway stock to the Gates Foundation, he’s able to deduct a bit of it, but his taxable income is so small relative to the amount he’s giving away that the deduction is almost trivial to him. What really matters is the fact that the Gates Foundation can then sell the stock tax-free. I don’t think what they’re doing is in any way tax evasion—it’s legitimate tax avoidance.

The Chouinard family is paying $17 million in taxes on this gift, right?

It’s almost an irrelevant detail because the amount of gift tax they’ll pay is so small relative to the donation they’re making. They want to stay in control of Patagonia. If they just gave 100% of their Patagonia shares to the (c)(4), then the (c)(4) would have control over Patagonia. Instead, they’ve created a dual-class structure, sort of like Google or The New York Times, where a minority shareholder actually has majority control. And they’re giving a 2% interest that has voting rights to a family trust. Then they’re giving 98% to the (c)(4). The family trust is not tax-exempt, so gifts to a non-exempt trust are subject to gift tax at a 40% rate. So that $17 million in gift tax is gift tax on the 2% of shares. But typically if you make a $3 billion gift [the estimated value of Patagonia], you’d be paying $1.2 billion in gift tax. So they’ve almost entirely eliminated their gift tax.

So if they had given the entire company to the (c)(4), they would have paid $0 in gift tax?

Right. They would’ve paid $0 in gift tax. And my understanding is the reason why they didn’t do that is because then the board of the (c)(4) would control Patagonia rather than the family. In practice, it doesn’t really matter that much because a) $17 million is pocket change to them and b) they’re going to have a lot of sway at the (c)(4). They would probably be able to control Patagonia through this (c)(4) anyway. This is a way of making sure that the family, rather than the nonprofit, remains calling the shots at Patagonia.

On Twitter, you took issue with the New York Times article announcing the Patagonia news and how it was framed. It differentiated between this and a similar gift that billionaire businessman Barre Seid made when he donated his entire company Tripp Lite to a nonprofit aimed at conservative political advocacy, including opposing climate advocacy efforts. I don’t want to equivocate on the merits of these two donations, but are these two very different people executing essentially the same financial gymnastics?

The only difference with Seid is he had arranged a sale of Tripp Lite, so if he didn’t move fast he would’ve faced a tax liability really soon. Whereas the Chouinards were planning ahead. If they didn’t do this, it’s not like they’d face a $1 billion tax bill next year. [Seid donated 100% of Tripp Lite shares to the nonprofit before selling the firm to an Irish conglomerate, allowing the nonprofit to reap untaxed $1.65 billion takeover fee.]

So, Patagonia’s owners weren’t under the same pressure, but in both situations two corporate owners gave away their companies to 5 01(c)(4)s in order to avoid taxes and use the money for political causes.



What the Chouinards are doing in terms of climate advocacy—they’re trying to save the planet. So, if I were them, I would like to think I would be as generous and do the same thing. So I do not mean to criticize them. I actually think they’ll probably use the money in a better way than if it went to the federal government and some of it went to fossil fuel subsidies. But one doesn’t want a constructed tax system predicated upon everyone being like the Chouinards.

Often (c)(4)s are associated with so-called dark money in politics. Is Patagonia’s donation technically considered dark money?

Advertisement

This isn’t dark money because we happen to know where the money is coming from. And it’s the same for Seid—we know where the money is coming from. (c)(4)s don’t have to disclose their donors to the public or even to the IRS. So whereas if it were a political campaign or a Super PAC, they would file an FEC disclosure where they would say, “This is who gave us money.”

So, the darkness is the lack of transparency, but the Chouinards are being entirely transparent here.



Do you have a critique of this maneuver or more of how the tax code is set up?

A few critiques: First, there is a critique of The New York Times that has different coverage of two substantively similar gifts. Second, the fact that you can give appreciated stock to a (c)(3) or a (c)(4) and not pay tax on it means that people are going to amass large fortunes, direct those fortunes without them going through the government and basically not pay any tax. That’s Gates, that’s Buffett, that’s Zuckerberg, that’s Seid, and the Chouinards. I think it makes sense for the government to subsidize charitable giving. It doesn’t make sense to subsidize it in this way. And it makes less sense to give that benefit to (c)(4)s that really don’t have to do anything charitable at all.

But given that we have the system we do and climate change is an urgent problem, I wouldn’t want liberals to say, oh, “We’re going to pay as much tax as we can.” I would want them to say, “Well, maybe we’ll try to change the rules, but until we do, we’ll play by those rules.”

https://gearjunkie.com/apparel/outerwear/patagonia-storm-shift-jacket-review,"Patagonia Storm Shift Jacket Review: Performance, Durability Meet Sustainability ‘Firsts’","After testing the Patagonia Storm Shift Jacket for 2 months, I'm convinced this shell is as good as it gets.

Downhill ski shells have gotten really good in the last decade or so. With continuous refinement and fierce competition in the market, it’s tough to find significant differentiation between the good and the great.

So maybe it’s no surprise that Patagonia’s premium Storm Shift Jacket is as good as they come. Skiing inbounds frequently, through both frigid cold storms and sunny bluebird days, the Storm Shift Jacket has proven comfortable, protective, and yet not overly warm or clammy. And it does this while using mostly recycled materials throughout the jacket and no “forever chemicals.”

The Storm Shift Jacket is the brand’s “first nonfluorinated GORE-TEX ePe membrane and PFC-free DWR finish,” according to Patagonia. But it has the same waterproof, breathable, durable performance consumers expect from the brand.

In short: The Patagonia Storm Shift ($479) is a slightly insulated downhill ski jacket that uses 100% recycled polyester GORE-TEX fabric and PFC-free DWRs to minimize its environmental impact. In terms of performance, it’s extremely good and should hold up for years of hard use. If it has a downside, it’s that the jacket’s weight and bulk make it a mediocre choice for ski touring. This is an inbounds-facing coat.

Patagonia Storm Shift Jacket Review

Putting on the Storm Shift Jacket for the first time, I immediately noticed the tough, slick feel of the face fabric. While most shells feel hard on the exterior face, the Storm Shift is extremely slippery to the touch, and in a good way. It seems that nothing is going to stick to it. And it also feels really tough.

That proved to be a good sign. In testing the 100% recycled two-layer GORE-TEX jacket, I put it through realistic use. That meant carrying sharp skis over my shoulder for 20 minutes when walking to the base of Copper Mountain. It also meant running into tree branches while looking for some powder stashes on a stormy day at Vail. And after a dozen days on a few mountains, the jacket still looks brand-spanking new.

Durability with this one shouldn’t be a problem.

I’ll get into more specs below, but to keep it short, this jacket has everything you need and not much you don’t. But do note, as a shell, it’s warm. That’s because it has some insulation in the form of a zigzag tricot knit in the liner. If you plan to wear this on warm days as a rain jacket, you may want to reconsider. This is a ski jacket through and through.

Patagonia Storm Shift: What It Has, What It Doesn’t

The Storm Shift is a nicely featured jacket. It has zippered pockets at the stomach, chest, forearm, and interior. It also has a large interior drop-in pocket. It’s the perfect amount, enough to carry everything from lunch to water to a lift pass in the forearm.

Next, the hood is great. It’s easily large enough to fit a helmet, and hugs tightly when adjusted to allow for peripheral vision. It closes around the face well and the design protects your nose from the zipper.

The main zipper is an excellent YKK model that seems to be extremely water-resistant. It zips smoothly and easily. The Velcro cuff closures are small but secure. And the powder skirt (Patagonia calls it a “powder gasket”) snugs tightly and stays in place thanks to a silicone texture.

Finally, the inside of the coat has an insulating liner that adds a fair amount of warmth to the shell. I wouldn’t call this jacket a parka. And for cold weather, you want to layer with a puffy or fleece underneath. On very cold days (under about 10 degrees Fahrenheit) I wore the ARTILECT Divide Stretch Down Hoodie as an underlayer and stayed pleasantly warm.

Fit, Function, and Cons

So, where does the Storm Shift come up short? Well, I’d say its weight is a possible ding against it. At 817 g (28.82 ounces), this is a substantial jacket. If you want to buy one jacket and plan to do a lot of touring, this is probably not a good choice. Not only does it weigh quite a bit, but it’ll also take up a lot of space in a pack and will be too warm for spring uphill touring. It certainly would be fine as a side-country jacket, or on ski tours on cold winter days. But it’s definitely a downhill-oriented coat.

The Storm Shift has what I’d call an “American fit.” By that, I mean that it fits true to size by North American standards. I’m 5’8″ and 150 pounds. A medium fit me but is a little loose. I could probably downsize to a small and be well-served, but the medium is OK if slightly baggy.

Patagonia Storm Shift Jacket: Conclusion

Who should consider the Patagonia Storm Shift? This is a great jacket for downhill skiers, period. The style is somewhat understated for sure. But if that’s your jam, the function of the Storm Shift is as good as any of the dozens of ski jackets I’ve tested over the years.

Patagonia’s level of refinement and attention to detail shines through in the Storm Shift. It’s a significant investment, but I expect the durability to be excellent and this jacket to last for many years of hard use.",['Sean Mccoy'],2023-02-17 22:12:41+00:00

Their pants, vests, and jackets are designed for rivers and mountaintops, yet are more commonly seen on the streets of New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Before the tracksuit became a well-regarded office attire, Patagonia clothing was the top choice for casual Wall Street Fridays.

The company is now making global headlines after its founder, Yvon Chouinard, a rock climber-turned-billionaire, his wife and two adult children transferred ownership of the company to a trust and group of non-profits that will use the benefit generated by a company valued at €3 billion to fight climate change, in a move first reported by The New York Times. “Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth,” wrote Chouinard in a letter on the company website. The announcement has been widely applauded as innovative in American philanthropy sectors, and it comes at a time when great fortunes are being subjected to greater scrutiny.

Chouinard, 83, says he never unexpected to become a millionaire. “I never wanted to be a businessman,” he writes. The son of a French-Canadian handyman who moved to the US, he started out as a craftsman making gear for his friends and then moved on to apparel. Over time, the brand became part of the identity of fans of outdoor life who are concerned about the deterioration of the environment. The company promoted a philosophy of consumption that broke with the main lines of capitalism. Unlike fast fashion, the brand invites its buyers to use its garments until these reach the end of their useful life. Patagonia stores do not open on Black Friday, a day when American consumerism is given free rein. They also allocate, and will continue to do so, 1% of their sales to environmental organizations. Despite this, the company has enjoyed phenomenal sales of more than $1 billion annually.

Chouinard, his wife and the couple’s two adult children, Fletcher and Claire, have transferred the company and fortune to two organizations: the Patagonia Purpose Trust, which will hold 2% of the company’s stock, and a non-profit organization for-profit company Holdfast Collective, which will own 98%. These were created to use the $100 million that the company earns annually in profits to fight the environmental crisis and defend nature around the world.

Located in the city of Ventura, California, north of Los Angeles, Patagonia will remain a for-profit brand. The trust obliges the members of the Chouinard family to ensure that the resources are being used in a good way. In his letter, the founder defends his choice. “One option was to sell Patagonia and donate all the money. But we couldn’t be sure a new owner would maintain our values or keep our team of people around the world employed. Another path was to take the company public. What a disaster that would have been. Even public companies with good intentions are under too much pressure to create short-term gain at the expense of long-term vitality and responsibility.”

“The Earth is now our only shareholder,” he writes.

https://fortune.com/2022/09/15/patagonia-ceo-says-founder-views-billionaires-as-policy-failure/,Patagonia CEO: Founder feels 'every billionaire is a policy failure',"In a modern and sustainable take on Willy Wonka, Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard (aged 83) is giving away his fortune. But this story doesn’t involve any golden tickets. Chouinard announced Wednesday that he is redirecting his profits to organizations focused on trying to save the environment, specifically funneling his funds to the newly established Patagonia Purpose Trust and Holdfast Collective.

The outdoor clothing and gear retailer will continue to operate like a normal business, but the founder and his family told the New York Times that they’ve decided to flip the switch on capitalism by shirking personal gain. They are transferring the ownership of Patagonia to a trust and nonprofit organization that will use the company’s profits to fight climate change.

Chouinard told the Times he doesn’t like being a billionaire, seemingly distancing himself from the lavish lifestyle of the über-rich.

“I was in Forbes magazine listed as a billionaire, which really, really pissed me off,” he said. “I don’t have $1 billion in the bank. I don’t drive Lexuses.”

“It was important to them that they were not seen as the financial beneficiaries,” Patagonia CEO Ryan Gellert said in the Times interview of Chouinard’s children, who didn’t want to inherit the company. “They felt very strongly about it. I know it can sound flippant, but they really embody this notion that every billionaire is a policy failure.”

The pandemic exacerbated already stark differences in how the ultra-wealthy and the rest of the world live. In 2021, the top 1% were able to take advantage of a soaring stock market and make like bandits. Their wealth increased to the tune of $6.5 trillion, per the Federal Reserve. As a result, more people have been calling for greater taxes on billionaires, and the government has slowly started to respond as the House Democrats recently introduced President Biden’s Billionaire Minimum Income Tax Act.

A 2021 poll from Vox and Data for Progress found that only 36% percent of respondents felt generally positive about billionaires, while 49% did not. And as faith in billionaires waned, so did general enthusiasm for the economic system that created these billionaires. A survey from Edelman Trust Barometer in 2020 found that most people felt capitalism does more harm than good.

Chouinard isn’t here to disagree with the masses. Instead of keeping the wealth in the family, he is actively working on using his billions to make a larger impact.

“We are going to give away the maximum amount of money to people who are actively working on saving this planet,” Chouinard said.

Lots of billionaires have big plans to give away their wealth (see Gates and Buffett), but Chouinard’s approach is unique. He chose to transfer all of the company’s voting stock to the Patagonia Purpose Trust, a move that allows Chouinard and the family to ensure that their goals of conservation and a sustainable business are effectively being implemented. The desire to stay on brand comes at a cost though, as the family is paying $17.5 million in taxes to set up the trust.

Patagonia and its owners have a long history of trying to operate in an ethical and environmentally conscious manner. In the 1980s, it first implemented an initiative where it gave 1% of its sales to environmental groups and movements.

A company inherently buys into capitalism and consumerism, but in this world, businesses have to innovate to create less damage, chair of Patagonia, Charles Conn said in commentary for Fortune. “This is not ‘woke’ capitalism. It’s the future of business if we want to build a better world for our children and all other creatures,” said Conn.",['Chloe Berger'],2022-09-15 00:00:00

Yvon Chouinard has divested control over Patagonia to a trust and future profits to a nonprofit. Whereas trust-controlled firms are new to the US, a similar corporate governance form has been around for centuries in Scandinavian countries. Their foundation-owned firms have been highly successful, survived for generations, and contributed to a better world.

Yvon Chouinard, founder and majority owner of Patagonia, dominated the headlines last week for doing something that no other billionaire has: donating almost all his wealth at once. He gave his apparel company and its millions in annual profits to an environmental nonprofit and placed its voting stock into a trust. For Chouinard, it was the only way that Patagonia’s values, including protecting nature, could be preserved.

While this approach may seem novel in the United States, it has been deployed for decades in Scandinavia. It’s demonstrated that billionaires can give away their companies and continue to generate considerable profits, while also contributing substantially to social and environmental causes.

Chouinard has not only made a world-changing investment in climate action through his donation of Patagonia, but also set a precedent for other American leaders to follow suit.

Terms of the Deal

Chouinard is donating all of the voting stock, which is held exclusively by the family, to the newly created Patagonia Purpose Trust. Although this voting stock represents only 2% of the company’s $3 billion value, the Trust will control the company, ensuring that Chouinard’s values are upheld to perpetuity.

The non-voting stock, which accounts for the remaining 98% in value, will be transferred to the Holdfast Collective. This nonprofit will receive Patagonia’s annual profits, which total about $100 million annually. According to The NonProfit Times, the Holdfast Collective seeks to “fight environmental crises, protect nature and biodiversity, and support thriving communities.”

Learning from Scandinavia

You might recognize companies like Carlsberg, Heineken, Ikea, Maersk, Novo-Nordisk, and Rolex. These companies have thrived for generations under a similar trust-controlled arrangement as Patagonia’s. They are owned by foundations, so their annual earnings are channelled to the foundation, which is governed by an independent board that loosely oversees the company’s operations. The foundation ensures that the founder’s original wishes are upheld.

Henry Hansmann of the Yale Law School and Steen Thomsen of the Copenhagen Business School showed that these foundation-owned firms are as profitable as investor- or family-owned firms. Denmark has a particularly large number of these companies, with 25% of the country’s 100 largest companies and 50% of its total market capitalization made up of foundation-owned firms. The Danish pharmaceutical company Novo-Nordisk contributes approximately 11% to Denmark’s medical research and development – unheard of among for-profit companies.

In many cases, the company’s founders may choose to create a foundation to help sustain their legacy and values. And in even more cases, the foundation provides an attractive alternative to the internal family struggles about succession. Canada’s Rogers family, for example, has been airing its family squabbles publicly. They have spent years in court disputing ownership and control of Rogers Communications, worth more than $20 billion.

Setting a Precedent

Chouinard and Patagonia have been mavericks in the business community since the company was formed in 1973. In fact, the patriarch would rather call himself “a dirtbag” than a billionaire.

In the ‘80s, Patagonia committed to donating the greater of 1% of its profits or 10% of sales to environmental activism. Chouinard went on to co-found 1% for the Planet, which now counts more than 5,000 companies as members. Ten years ago, Patagonia also became the first California-based company to be registered as a ‘Benefit Corporation’, legally bound to create a “material positive impact on society and the environment.” It also remains one of the few multinationals of its size that is a certified B-Corp.

Chouinard has once again carved a new path for U.S.-based companies. This next move could have a significant impact on other American business leaders.

Warren Buffett has pledged to give away 99% of his wealth to social causes, yet at 92 years old, he has only given away a fraction of that amount. Even though Buffett has been making money from companies that have not advanced social causes, he can ensure that his legacy is more positive by following Chouinard’s lead.","['Tima Bansal', 'Amy Danise']",2022-09-20 00:00:00

Privately held, Patagonia is valued at $3 billion. Under the new ownership structure, Patagonia will distribute roughly $100 million to the nonprofit to prompt environmental causes. And it will function as a B-corp—a for-profit corporation mandated to meet high standards of audited social and environmental performance and transparency.

“Earth is now our only shareholder,” Yvon Chouinard wrote, in a statement distributed on Patagonia’s website.

Chouinard’s environmentally minded move garnered global headlines. To be sure, there were significant tax benefits for him and his family. But nonetheless, the transfer serves as an important reminder of the reality of climate change and the role companies can play in tackling the threat.

It also occurred as intense flooding in Pakistan has killed nearly 1,500 people, likely attributable to rainfall that was worsened by climate change. Meanwhile, this summer marked one of the hottest on record, suggesting more climate-related disasters lie ahead.

It’s against this backdrop that the Climate Week summit, held concurrently in New York City with the U.N. General Assembly, is taking place this week. The climate crisis continues to be of strong interest to investors and consumers: According to a new study by the journal Nature Communications, an overwhelming majority of Americans want action to address global warming.

For our special report about Climate Week, we chose to focus on the risks and rewards of investing energy.

Fossil fuels will remain a huge source of the emissions that cause global warming—but they also are critical to the energy transition. And there are plenty of opportunities, too, as the Inflation Reduction Act shows. As Stephanie Mah of DBRS Morningstar writes, “efforts to improve affordability of clean energy and strengthen resiliency to climate change [have] come front and center.” Indeed, thanks to the new law, the costs of renewable energy are expected to decline dramatically over the next decade.

In our report, Morningstar’s Jon Hale looks at the largest renewable energy funds. Analysts Allen Good and David Meats, who follow the oil sector, discuss in a Q&A how oil companies are preparing for the carbon transition. (Oil giant Shell, incidentally, just named its renewables chief as its new CEO.) Adam Fleck, director of equity research, ESG, shares a trio of promising climate-action stocks. And in the coming days, we’ll take a closer look at appealing investments in renewable energy, promising climate-action technologies, the pitfalls of thematic investing, and the world of carbon credits.

You should also flip over to our sister site, Investable World, a Morningstar data project that looks at a variety of sustainable investing themes— such as energy—and how to invest in them. For example, you can see which funds have exposure to nuclear power.

Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard is giving away the company by transferring it to a newly established trust and nonprofit in order to ensure its profits go towards combatting the climate crisis.

Chouinard, the rock climber-turned-billionaire, announced the move in a statement on Wednesday.

""Instead of 'going public,' you could say we're 'going purpose.' Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we'll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth,"" he wrote.

Chouinard, 83, said that he opted for the unique ownership model instead of selling the company to an owner that could potentially compromise Patagonia's values, or going public and leaving the company beholden to shareholders first.

Instead, ownership of the outdoor apparel company, valued at around $3 billion, is being transferred to the Patagonia Purpose Trust and Holdfast Collective.

""It's been nearly 50 years since we began our experiment in responsible business, and we are just getting started. If we have any hope of a thriving planet—much less a thriving business—50 years from now, it is going to take all of us doing what we can with the resources we have. This is another way we've found to do our part,"" Chouinard said.

Patagonia said going forward all profits that are not reinvested back into the company will be distributed to Holdfast Collective to go towards environmental causes, according to an additional statement provided to Insider. The company estimates this amount will total about $100 million each year.

Founded by Chouinard nearly 50 years ago, Patagonia is well known for breaking with conventional business practices and for its commitment to sustainability.

In an interview with The New York Times about the decision, Chouinard said he hopes the move will ""influence a new form of capitalism that doesn't end up with a few rich people and a bunch of poor people.""

""We are going to give away the maximum amount of money to people who are actively working on saving this planet,"" he said.

Dan Mosley of merchant bank BDT & Co., who helped Patagonia structure the move, told The Times he's never seen anything like it: ""In my 30 plus years of estate planning, what the Chouinard family has done is really remarkable.""

""It's irrevocably committed. They can't take it back out again, and they don't want to ever take it back out again,"" Mosley said.

Chouinard and his family have given away most of their wealth throughout his lifetime, making them one of the most charitable families in the US.

Chouinard has also famously said that Patagonia's decisions that were good for the planet have also been good for business.

""I didn't know what to do with the company because I didn't ever want a company,"" Chouinard told The Times. ""I didn't want to be a businessman. Now I could die tomorrow and the company is going to continue doing the right thing for the next 50 years, and I don't have to be around.""","['Kelsey Vlamis', 'Lakshmi Varanasi']",2022-09-14 00:00:00

Many brands are aligning profits with purpose, but Patagonia's decision in September to convert its for-profit business to one under which all the profits flow through to fighting climate change is the most complex move yet by a U.S.-based company in the realm of sustainable capitalism. Is it a model for other companies to pursue in the future? For the family founded firm, it's in some ways a natural evolution. Patagonia has long been on the vanguard of responsible business practices. As far back as 1985, Patagonia deployed portions of its profits to the environment, via an ""Earth tax."" It's far from the only well-known U.S. brand to be structured in a way that allows profits to be donated to charitable causes. Newman's Own, the food brand founded by Hollywood icon Paul Newman, is perhaps the most familiar. Since 1982, Newman's Own has given 100% of profits to charity, now totaling half a billion dollars in contributions. But that business, with a pure non-profit structure, was more of a ""first generation"" model for sustainable business, says Tensie Whelan, founding director of the NYU Stern Center for Sustainable Business. ""The Patagonia model is a little more sophisticated."" A business model already in Europe Yet while Patagonia made headlines in the U.S. for being a novel marriage of capitalism and charity, similar corporate structures are already in use with several large family-controlled European companies, from Carlsberg to Ikea and Novo Nordisk. ""Nothing new in this model,"" said Morten Bennedsen, professor of family enterprise at INSEAD and the academic director of the Wendel International Centre for Family Enterprise. Even in the U.S., one of the most iconic retail brands, has long had a No. 1 shareholder devoted to charitable causes and designed by the family founder: Hershey's. ""It is a model that is attractive for family firms that do not want to continue as classical family firms and want the long term stability and the increased professionalization that comes with enterprise foundations,"" Bennedsen said. It often is very attractive from a corporate tax perspective, too, which has been noted of both the Ikea and Patagonia business models. ""That is another driver of this,"" he said. One hundred percent of Patagonia profits are now committed to its new non-profit Holdfast Collective — which owns all of the company's non-voting stock (98% of the total stock). A Patagonia spokeswoman said the move makes clear that it is possible to ""do good for people and planet and still be a successful business."" 'Unapologetically a for-profit' Patagonia's CEO went further in a September interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" dismissing any idea that this change will lead it to focus less on beating the competition. ""What people fail to understand about Patagonia, both the past and the future, is that we are unapologetically a for-profit business, and we are extremely competitive,"" Ryan Gellert said. ""We compete with every other company in our space aggressively. I don't think we've lost that instinct,"" he said. ""This whole thing fails if we do not continue to run a competitive business."" ""How we build our products, how we sell them, and then the goal of releasing value to help the environment ... the alignment of these goals gets lost if the story fails to recognize that Patagonia is a for-profit business with its profits being released to help the environment,"" the spokeswoman said. ""That's an essential distinction.""

There are less extreme options for values-driven founders than the paths chosen by Yvon Chouinard and Paul Newman. ""Most founders like to maintain control and have for-profit (less altruistic) sensibilities,"" Whelan said. B-Corp status, employee-ownership, and mutual organizations and cooperatives are all models that allow more focus on creating stakeholder value, in addition to shareholder value. ""We are seeing significant growth in these alternative models,"" Whelan said. Indeed, since 2011 the number of B-corps has steadily been on the rise, with the total number recently topping five thousand. For its part, Patagonia as a business will remain unchanged in terms of its day-to-day operations, but all of its profits (after reinvesting in the company, paying employees, etc.) will be handed over to the Holdfast Collective to fight climate change, an annual profit stream estimated at around $100 million per year. ""This was a process unlike any I've ever been a part of before,"" said Greg Curtis, executive director of the Holdfast Collective. ""It really started with what's going to happen long term with the company, so that the purpose doesn't change going forward. We want to recognize natural life spans ... What does this actually mean for capitalism? What really motivates people – is it profit, is it purpose?""

https://www.seattletimes.com/business/billionaire-no-more-patagonia-founder-gives-away-the-company/,Billionaire no more: Patagonia founder gives away the company,"A half-century after founding outdoor apparel maker Patagonia, Yvon Chouinard, the eccentric rock climber who became a reluctant billionaire with his unconventional spin on capitalism, has given the company away.

Rather than selling the company or taking it public, Chouinard, his wife and two adult children have transferred their ownership of Patagonia, valued at about $3 billion, to a specially designed trust and a nonprofit organization. They were created to preserve the company’s independence and ensure that all of its profits — some $100 million a year — are used to combat climate change and protect undeveloped land around the globe.

The unusual move comes at a moment of growing scrutiny for billionaires and corporations, whose rhetoric about making the world a better place is often overshadowed by their contributions to the very problems they claim to want to solve.

At the same time, Chouinard’s relinquishment of the family fortune is in keeping with his long-standing disregard for business norms and his lifelong love for the environment.

“Hopefully this will influence a new form of capitalism that doesn’t end up with a few rich people and a bunch of poor people,” Chouinard, 83, said in an exclusive interview. “We are going to give away the maximum amount of money to people who are actively working on saving this planet.”

Patagonia will continue to operate as a private, for-profit corporation based in Ventura, California, selling more than $1 billion worth of jackets, hats and ski pants each year. But the Chouinards, who controlled Patagonia until last month, no longer own the company.

In August, the family irrevocably transferred all the company’s voting stock, equivalent to 2% of the overall shares, into a newly established entity known as the Patagonia Purpose Trust.

The trust, which will be overseen by members of the family and their closest advisers, is intended to ensure that Patagonia makes good on its commitment to run a socially responsible business and give away its profits. Because the Chouinards donated their shares to a trust, the family will pay about $17.5 million in taxes on the gift.

The Chouinards then donated the other 98% of Patagonia, its common shares, to a newly established nonprofit organization called the Holdfast Collective, which will now be the recipient of all the company’s profits and use the funds to combat climate change. Because the Holdfast Collective is a 501(c)(4), which allows it to make unlimited political contributions, the family received no tax benefit for its donation.

“There was a meaningful cost to them doing it, but it was cost they were willing to bear to ensure that this company stays true to their principles,” said Dan Mosley, a partner at BDT & Co., a merchant bank that works with ultrawealthy individuals including Warren Buffett, and who helped Patagonia design the new structure. “And they didn’t get a charitable deduction for it. There is no tax benefit here whatsoever.”

That differs from the choice made by Barre Seid, a Republican donor who recently gave 100% of his electronics manufacturing company to a nonprofit organization shortly before the company was sold, reaping an enormous personal tax windfall and making a $1.6 billion gift to fund conservative fights over abortion rights, climate change and more.

By giving away the bulk of their assets during their lifetime, the Chouinards — Yvon, his wife Malinda, and their two children, Fletcher and Claire, who are both in their 40s — have established themselves as among the most charitable families in the country.

Patagonia has already donated $50 million to the Holdfast Collective and expects to contribute an additional $100 million this year, making the new organization a major player in climate philanthropy.

Mosley said the story was unlike any other he had seen in his career. “In my 30-plus years of estate planning, what the Chouinard family has done is really remarkable,” he said. “It’s irrevocably committed. They can’t take it back out again, and they don’t want to ever take it back out again.”

For Chouinard, it was even simpler than that, providing a satisfactory resolution to the matter of succession planning.

“I didn’t know what to do with the company because I didn’t ever want a company,” he said from his home in Jackson, Wyoming. “I didn’t want to be a businessman. Now I could die tomorrow and the company is going to continue doing the right thing for the next 50 years, and I don’t have to be around.”

‘This might actually work’

In some ways, the forfeiture of Patagonia is not terribly surprising coming from Chouinard.

Advertising

As a pioneering rock climber in California’s Yosemite Valley in the 1960s, Chouinard lived out of his car and ate damaged cans of cat food that he bought for 5 cents apiece.

Even today, he wears raggedy old clothes, drives a beat-up Subaru and splits his time between modest homes in Ventura and Jackson. Chouinard does not own a computer or a cellphone.

Patagonia, which Chouinard founded in 1973, became a company that reflected his own idealistic priorities, as well as those of his wife. The company was an early adopter of everything from organic cotton to on-site child care, and famously discouraged consumers from buying its products, with an advertisement on Black Friday in The New York Times that read, “Don’t Buy This Jacket.”

The company has given away 1% of its sales for decades, mostly to grassroots environmental activists. And in recent years, the company has become more politically active, going so far as to sue the Trump administration in a bid to protect Bears Ears National Monument.

Yet as Patagonia’s sales soared, Chouinard’s own net worth continued to climb, creating an uncomfortable conundrum for an outsider who abhors excessive wealth.

“I was in Forbes magazine listed as a billionaire, which really, really pissed me off,” he said. “I don’t have $1 billion in the bank. I don’t drive Lexuses.”

Sponsored

The Forbes ranking, and then the COVID-19 pandemic, helped set in motion a process that would unfold over the past two years, and ultimately lead to the Chouinards giving away the company.

In mid-2020, Chouinard began telling his closest advisers, including Ryan Gellert, the company’s CEO, that if they couldn’t find a good alternative, he was prepared to sell the company.

“One day he said to me, ‘Ryan, I swear to God, if you guys don’t start moving on this, I’m going to go get the Fortune magazine list of billionaires and start cold-calling people,’” Gellert said. “At that point we realized he was serious.”

‘The ideal solution’

Now that the future of Patagonia’s ownership is clear, the company will have to make good on its lofty ambitions to simultaneously run a profitable corporation while tackling climate change.

Some experts caution that without the Chouinard family having a financial stake in Patagonia, the company and the related entities could lose their focus. While the children remain on Patagonia’s payroll and the elder Chouinards have enough to live comfortably on, the company will no longer be distributing any profits to the family.

“What makes capitalism so successful is that there’s motivation to succeed,” said Ted Clark, executive director of the Northeastern University Center for Family Business. “If you take all the financial incentives away, the family will have essentially no more interest in it except a longing for the good old days.”

Advertising

As for how the Holdfast Collective will distribute Patagonia’s profits, Chouinard said much of the focus will be on nature-based climate solutions such as preserving wild lands. And as a 501(c)(4), the Holdfast Collective will also be able to build on Patagonia’s history of funding grassroots activists, but it could also lobby and donate to political campaigns.

For the Chouinards, it resolves the question of what will happen to Patagonia after its founder is gone, ensuring that the company’s profits will be put to work protecting the planet.

“I feel a big relief that I’ve put my life in order,” Chouinard said. “For us, this was the ideal solution.”","['The New York Times', 'This Story Was Originally Published At Nytimes.Com.']",2022-09-14 15:32:05

While Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard’s decision Wednesday to give away the outdoor-apparel company to help tackle climate change and other environmental problems shocked some in the industry, many people familiar with Chouinard weren’t surprised. 10 steps you can take to lower your carbon footprint ArrowRight “It seemed very Yvon to me,” said John Sterling, who worked in Patagonia’s environmental programs from 1996 to 2002. “When I worked there, it was a challenge to out-activist Yvon.”

Chouinard, a nature-loving rock climber turned businessman and reluctant billionaire, founded Patagonia in 1973 and has since been molding the company into a leader in responsible business. Giving Patagonia away marks the boldest act of environmental activism yet, after years of unconventional crusades ranging from a campaign against genetic engineering to suing a sitting president over protecting public lands.

Patagonia’s reputation isn’t “a conceived of strategy for the brand,” Sterling said, but rather it reflects Chouinard’s values. “He’s got a pretty clear sense of where he’s headed.”

In a 2012 interview, Chouinard, now 83, explained that the resources he has to “do good” come from his company.

Despite being “a relatively small company in the scheme of things,” Patagonia, he said, “has this tremendous power to change — well, I mean, I hate to be bragging, but change society and to change larger companies and lead by example.”

Here are a few of the radical pursuits Patagonia has undertaken during its nearly 50-year history.

Civil disobedience training and bail policy

For years, the company has provided optional nonviolent civil disobedience trainings to employees. The sessions, Sterling said, stemmed from a group of employees getting arrested in 1996 at a protest against logging ancient redwoods in a forest in Northern California.

Patagonia has also established a bail policy to help any employee who is arrested while peacefully protesting, provided that they have previously completed a civil disobedience class.

This policy of encouraging dissent is not confined to environmental issues. This summer, amid the nationwide debate over abortion, the company announced in a post on LinkedIn that all part-time and full-time employees receive “training and bail for those who peacefully protest for reproductive justice.”

“We don’t have a just society, and that’s when you need civil disobedience, absolutely,” Chouinard said in the 2012 interview.

Environmental Internship Program

Patagonia’s Environmental Internship Program offers employees the opportunity to take up to two months away from their regular jobs to work for an environmental group of their choice while continuing to earn their paycheck and benefits.

John Wallin, who worked at Patagonia from 1993 to 1999, did two internships through the program — an experience that he said inspired him to leave the company and start his own nonprofit environmental organization.

“I did that because the internships both gave me a fluency in the issues and a desire to make a bigger difference,” said Wallin, who founded the Nevada Wilderness Project. “The Patagonia response, when I said, ‘I think I’m going to leave my middle management job in mail order and start this nonprofit because I think we can protect a lot of Nevada,’ was ‘That is so fantastic. Here’s a phone line and a desk in our service center in Reno.’”

According to Patagonia, 34 employees, 12 stores and one department took advantage of the program this year, which amounted to “almost 10,000 volunteer hours for 43 organizations.”

Efforts to remove dams

Patagonia has long supported the removal of dams, especially those that are “derelict and particularly harmful,” according to a 2014 company statement.

In the statement, Chouinard called himself “a lover of wild rivers.” “That’s why our company has been involved in trying to take out obsolete and damaging dams since 1993,” he said.

The company has advocated for the removal of four lower dams on the Snake River, placing four full-page ads in the New York Times in 1999 that called attention to the impacts of those dams on Pacific Northwest salmon populations, said Sterling, who was directing the company’s environmental programs at the time.

More recently, Patagonia funded a 2014 documentary film called “DamNation,” which aimed to mobilize support for demolishing dams to revive wild fish populations.

1% for the Planet

Patagonia has been donating money to causes it supports since the 1970s. But starting in 1985, the company pledged that 1 percent of its sales would go toward “the preservation and restoration of the natural environment.”

In 2002, Chouinard co-founded a nonprofit corporation called “1% for the Planet” in an effort to get other businesses to do the same.

“1% of sales is a hard number,” Chouinard said in the 2012 interview. “And I don’t look at it as charity. It’s our cost of doing business.”

The 1% for the Planet alliance now has more than 5,000 members, according to its website — a list that includes brands such as Kleen Kanteen, Boxed Water and Caudalie.

Public lands advocacy

A fierce defender of public lands, Patagonia made headlines when Chouinard and the company became embroiled in a high-profile fight with the Trump administration over national monuments in Utah.

After President Donald Trump moved to drastically reduce the size of the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in December 2017, Patagonia posted a stark message to its website: “The President Stole Your Land.”

“In an illegal move, the president just reduced the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments,” the rest of the message read. “This is the largest elimination of protected land in American history.”

In the lead-up to December and after, Patagonia carried out a multipronged effort to support public land protections that went beyond assisting grass-roots environmental organizations.

The company orchestrated a publicity effort that included its first-ever television ad — a one-minute spot that featured Chouinard, who is known for being somewhat of a recluse, talking about the importance of public lands and “wild places.” Patagonia and other outdoor recreation companies also successfully moved a major industry trade show out of Salt Lake City to Denver.

Patagonia joined a coalition of Native American and grass-roots groups in a lawsuit aimed at forcing Trump to restore Bears Ears’ original boundaries.

The decision to sue a sitting president was “fairly unprecedented” for a company like Patagonia, said Josh Ewing, who worked with Patagonia on Bears Ears while heading the nonprofit Friends of Cedar Mesa.

The lawsuit and the effort to move the trade show “were steps that companies usually don’t take,” said Ewing, who now directs the Rural Climate Partnership. “They don’t take protest-like steps with their money because they’re afraid of their money, they’re afraid of losing their money if they get too active.”

https://footwearnews.com/2022/business/athletic-outdoor/patagonia-close-stores-paid-week-off-holidays-1203384480/,Patagonia to Close All Stores And Give Workers a Paid Week Off For Holidays,"Patagonia is once again shutting down its North American stores, warehouse and offices for the week after Christmas, giving employees a week of paid time off to rest and recharge.

North American employees will receive paid time off between Dec. 25 through Jan. 1, CEO Ryan Gellert announced in a release.

“We believe in providing quality of life for our people,” Gellert said in a statement. “I want to thank Patagonia’s incredible employees for an amazing year of working to save our home planet, and I want to thank our nonprofit partners and customers for their continued support and friendship.”

The outdoor apparel maker first instituted the practice last year and said at the time that while it’s e-commerce site would be open, no orders would ship during the holiday period.

It is has become increasingly common for major retailers to close their doors on certain major holidays like Thanksgiving. Walmart, Kohl’s, Best Buy, Dick’s Sporting Goods and more kept their doors closed on Thanksgiving this year. And Target said that its decision to remain closed on Thanksgiving became permanent as of 2021.

Still, Patagonia’s week-long paid holiday break initiative is an outlier in an industry that typically runs major sales drives in stores the week after Christmas.

Patagonia is known for its efforts to adhere to its values as company, including protecting the planet and its employees. The company was one of the first major U.S. retailers to close during the onset of COVID-19.And in September, Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard said he is transferring ownership of the privately-held business, reportedly valued at $3 billion, to a nonprofit and specially designated trust. The move was meant to ensure that the company’s profits are completely reinvested in the business or used to further values and goals related to the environment.

https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/visit-los-alerces-national-park-argentina,Hug Some of the Oldest Trees on Earth in Patagonia,"Welcome to (Inter)National Parks: Adventures in the Global Outdoors , where we transport you to the world’s most incredible protected lands, nature reserves, and marine sanctuaries, from the slopes of Western Canada to the vast grasslands of Botswana to the fjords of New Zealand. For more on these far-flung natural wonders—plus travel tips and expert interviews—check out the rest of our coverage here

In a place as fairy-tale gorgeous as northern Patagonia, it takes a lot to stand out. But ancient 3,600-year-old trees bordering greenish-turquoise glacial lakes so vibrant they look fake, backed by snow-capped mountains with Andean condors gracefully soaring overhead, make the World Heritage Site of Los Alerces National Park well worth a stop on a trip to Argentina. Alerce trees (Fitzroya cupressoides) happen to be the oldest living thing in Argentina—and one of the oldest trees in the world. Los Alerces National Park was created in 1937 in order to protect these evergreens similar to the monstrous North American sequoia. Its original name in the native Mapuche language is Lahuan or Lawan, meaning “cure” or “remedy,” hinting that this tree probably holds more power than we know. But there’s more to this half million-acre park than just cool, old, healing trees. This is an ecosystem that’s home to puma, huiña cat (austral spotted cat), huillín (an endangered native otter), culpeo fox, and gray fox. There are even some random bright pink flamingos and lime-green Austral parakeets thrown in to make you say “huh?” The vibe here is wild enough that none less than famous outlaws Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid once took to hiding out in a log cabin nearby. Between horseback riding to connect with your inner gaucho, hiking through Valdivian temperate rain forest, swimming Wim Hof-style with glaciers in view, world-class rafting on the nearby Futaleufú River, and fly fishing in water so clear you can watch huge rainbow trout swim by, Los Alerces and the surrounding area merits at least a full few days of your time. Consider that just outside the park is Argentina’s up-and-coming wine destination, Trevelin, and you may find yourself never wanting to leave this little slice of surreal heaven. Most adventure travelers come to Patagonia for the epic hiking of Torres del Paine in Chile or Fitz Roy in El Chalten, but locals know that smaller national parks like Los Alerces hold similar views with a smaller percentage of the crowds. And only in Parque Nacional Los Alerces will you have the chance to hang out with these legendary trees that grow extremely slowly (1 millimeter per year), but reach heights over 150 feet. If you’re looking to slow down and let nature help put everything in perspective for you, the alerces could indeed be what the Mapuche call a “cure.” Here’s everything to know about visiting Los Alerces.

Drive one of the most beautiful road trips The nearby town of Esquel has a tiny airport, and from there local buses can get you to the park—though it can be a bit of a headache with varying frequency and routes depending on the time of year. For a more streamlined and complete Patagonian experience, land in the larger touristic hub of Bariloche, rent a car, and road trip south along route 40. You’ll be in for the most stunning five-hour drive of your life; one moment it’ll seem like you’re in the lupine-flower-filled setting of The Sound of Music, then blink and you’ll feel like you’re the main character in beige and sandy desert-steppe Dune. The park has three main access gates. The north gate, fifteen miles from Cholila, takes you in by the Rivadavia Lake area. The central gate stems from Route 40 twenty miles from Esquel and starts you by Futalaufquen Lake and Villa Futalaufquen. And the lesser-used south gate brings you close to the Futaleufú Hydroelectric Complex, six miles from Trevelin. The roads within the park are gravel and slow going, so relax, embrace the pace, and be sure to make a leisurely stop at every roadside waterfall to soak up the view.

Escape the northern winter The park gets saturated with local tourism in January and February, as this is summer break here. November and December, or alternatively March through May, is ideal for the best chance at pleasant weather with fewer people in the park. During spring in the Southern Hemisphere (starting in November), bright yellow retama bushes and thousands of pastel-colored lupines color the landscape. Whereas come fall around May, the lenga trees turn some higher-altitude forests blood red with their changing leaves. The park entrances have strict hours: Gates open at 9 am and close at 8 pm in the summer. In the low season, gates close at 5 pm. With Argentina’s constantly shifting inflation right now, prices can change overnight, but the entrance fee for foreign tourists is usually the equivalent of around $10 USD, to be paid in cash only in Argentine pesos. Come prepared (and maybe bring extra cash just in case), as there is no ATM in the park. In the off-season of May through October, there is no entrance fee.

This is not a park that is well-equipped yet for foreign tourism, so planning ahead (especially if you don’t speak Spanish) can be a little confusing. This site is the best to point you in the right direction for who to contact for camping, booking a cabin, or planning activities. Don’t expect a fast response from anyone within the park—there is no wifi outside of the main Tourist Information Center and no reliable cell signal. As for what to pack? While the internet will tell you that average summer temps can be in the 70s or 80s, what you don’t usually hear is that there can be frosts even in the middle of the summer season. At any time it can decide to rain, blast you with sun, or kick up incredibly strong winds. Bring layers and an “open to enjoying whatever happens” attitude.

Hike to waterfalls, lake views, glaciers, and ancient trees There are 19 official hiking trails with different levels of difficulty. Maps can be found in the Information Center, which is also where you should register to let them know where you plan on hiking in the park. The easiest walk would be the Irigoyen Waterfall Trail, which in an easy five minutes will have you cutting through forests and along the river for views of a tranquil waterfall. This one is good if you just need to get out of the car for a few minutes to stretch your legs. A step up, but still an easy walk, is the Mirador Lago Verde trail, which is 1.3 miles with an elevation gain of 200 feet that takes you up to a picturesque lake overlook, an ideal spot for busting out a thermos and drinking yerba mate like a local.

For a better chance to see wildlife, the Lago Verde & Glacier Mirador Trail is a 5.1 mile partial loop trail with an elevation gain of 1,158 feet, still easily doable if you’re in decent walking shape and want to feel like you did a “real” hike. If you’re feeling extra ambitious, try climbing El Dedal Peak (high difficulty, lasting about seven hours). From the summit, you can see part of Futalaufquen Lake, the Situación Peak, and the Desaguadero River valley.

If you want something with a bit more flair, try trekking the 24,000-year-old Torrecillas glacier. You’ll need to book this excursion ahead of time, as it requires a 40-minute boat ride and a certified guide. And if you have come this far to see alerce trees, you can’t leave without a visit to the Alerzal Milenario. Boats leave from Puerto Chucao to cross Lago Menéndez, where you disembark and follow a trail to one of the oldest trees on Earth, “El Abuelo.” Plan this excursion ahead of time, as there are few boat options per day and the limited tickets sell out fast in the summer. The trails are well-marked and provide reliable information. If you come when there’s snow, heads up that the covered trails will be difficult to follow—they aren’t exactly well-trodded in the winter.

Drink wine, explore ice tunnels, or ride the Old Patagonian Express After you’re done hiking, there’s so much more to do in the area. You can horseback ride or explore ice tunnels, or be decadently lazy and take in the Patagonian scenery by boat excursion. To further enjoy the water, you can rent a kayak or fly fish (fishing season is November 1 - May 1). Or simply find yourself a secluded spot on a pebbled beach, eat a picnic lunch of empanadas, then siesta unapologetically for the rest of the afternoon.

Just outside the park are the microbreweries of Esquel (and a wonderfully intimate and well-stocked wine bar called Hache Patagonia). From there, you could also ride La Trochita, a still-functioning steam engine train. Known as the Old Patagonian Express, it feels like you’re being transported to a different era. Nearby is Piedra Parada for world-class rock climbing.

Head towards Trevelin for wine tasting at Casa Yague (the second-most southern winery in the world) or Contra Corriente. If you happen to be in town late October or early November, check out the tulip fields nearby in full bloom. Also in Trevelin, Fondo Sur serves up upscale but never pretentious farm-to-table food, or take in high tea with all sorts of yummy desserts made with heavy cream at one of the Welsh tea houses in town. A quick and easy jaunt over the Chilean border (just a few miles outside of Trevelin) will land you in Futaleufu, home of some of the planet’s top white water rafting.

Where to stay near Los Alerces If you’re on a backpacker’s budget or just feel like going rustic, you can camp in one of the seven organized campgrounds with infrastructure or nine wild camps. Especially if you plan on traveling in the summer months, reserve a spot ahead of time. There are multiple cabins and hostels in the park as well, but close to the park outside of Esquel is Huemules, a glamping company offering cozy domes that make for a very comfortable and memorable stay. The vineyard of Casa Yague in Trevelin also rents out homey private cabanas.

Chouinard and his family are transferring ownership of Patagonia to a trust and nonprofit in an effort to maintain the company’s environmentalist values and increase its contributions toward fighting climate change.

“Earth is now our only shareholder,” Chouinard said in a statement.

As part of the shift, Chouinard committed Patagonia to giving away all its excess profits to efforts to fight the environmental crisis.

The company’s excess profits will go to the Holdfast Collective, an environmental nonprofit organization that is also receiving the entirety of Patagonia’s nonvoting shares — about 98 percent of the company.

The remaining 2 percent of the company — the voting shares — will go to the Patagonia Purpose Trust. The trust, which was created to protect and maintain Patagonia’s values, will have final say on key decisions.

Chouinard noted that they chose not to sell Patagonia or take the company public for fear that its values would be compromised.

“Instead of ‘going public,’ you could say we’re ‘going purpose,’” Chouinard said. “Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth.”

Despite giving away ownership, Chouinard said he and his family will continue to guide the Patagonia Purpose Trust and Holdfast Collective and sit on the board of directors.","['Julia Shapero', 'Susan Armstrong I This Column Was Created Jobbio', 'Days Ago', 'Am Et', 'Hours Ago']",2022-09-14 22:09:10+00:00
https://explorersweb.com/a-5th-climber-dies-in-patagonia/,A 5th Climber Dies in Patagonia,"The Patagonia climbing season is unfolding with several great climbs, solos, traverses and new routes, but also an alarming number of fatalities. The latest occurred on Tuesday near the base of Cerro Torre.

Marcos Gorostiaga, a 28-year-old doctor from Bariloche, Argentina, was climbing 1,953m Cerro Mocho when a large rock struck him. His climbing partner was some 80 meters away and radioed for help, Cumbres Mountain Magazine reported. Somewhat unusually, the army deployed a helicopter to the site, but rescuers could only verify that the climber had died.

Five dead so far

Gorostiaga is the fifth casualty in Patagonia this season. Christoph Klein of Switzerland fell to his death on an icefield near Cerro Standhart in December; Cassandra Doolittle of the U.S. died of hypothermia after getting lost on her way down from soloing Aguja Guillaumet. Two weeks ago, an avalanche swept Basque climbers Iker Bilbao and Amaia Aguirre into a crevasse near the Brecha de los Italianos, during their descent from a successful climb of Fitz Roy.

The crew at Comision de Auxilio (Aid Commission) in El Chalten is overwhelmed, rescue doctor Carolina Codo told TiempoSur two weeks ago. The volunteer rescue service desperately lacks resources. There are only six rescuers, Codo said, while the number of visitors in the region is increasing. They have no helicopter of their own and only rarely, as on this occasion, does the army send a military helicopter. However, it is not suitable for mountain rescues.

“Four climbers dead in a season is a record,” said Codo in mid-January. After this week’s fatality, that mark is now even higher.

Does good weather kill?

Some suggest that unusually high temperatures are triggering avalanches and rockfalls. In some cases, the dangerous conditions have prevented rescuers from approaching the sites of accidents. In an article in Gripped, editor Brandon Pullan points out that “Every year…more climbers die in Patagonia.”

Pullan also cited Jacob Cook’s comments on social media. Cook was climbing on Fitz Roy when Bilbao and Aguirre died at the base of the mountain. The accident occurred at the same place where a friend of Cook’s had lost his life the previous year. Cook and his partners had to make a nerve-wracking descent through that region just hours after the Basques perished.

“I was literally shaking with fear until we found ourselves running along the glacier through the avalanche debris,” Cook wrote. “Honestly, the frequency with which people die and the extent to which the mountains are decomposing within each warm weather window [makes] climbing here feeling almost suicidal.”

Argentinian climber Guillermo Martin, who maintains the Cultura de Montaña blog, confirmed to ExplorersWeb that the weather has been unseasonably warm in Patagonia for the last month.","['Angela Benavides', 'Sam Anderson', 'Kris Annapurna', 'Rebecca Mcphee', 'Andrew Mclemore', 'Andrew Marshall']",2023-02-02 23:29:18+00:00
https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2022/09/28/patagonias-influence-utah-lands/,Patagonia’s influence on Utah lands just got a ‘turbocharger’,"(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) View of Monument Valley, with the Bears Ears in the distance, from the Pine Spring in Monument Valley, on Thursday, May 26, 2022.

In the beginning, there was an expansive swath of land sacred to numerous Indigenous tribes in southern Utah. There was a climber named Josh Ewing, and an advocacy organization called Friends of Cedar Mesa that did not have, as Ewing put it, “enough to pay a paycheck for someone to run the organization.”

There was no Bears Ears, not in monument form anyway.

“We were like, ‘Who out there in this universe cares about public lands and, you know, can support a little grassroots organization in the middle of nowhere?’” Ewing said.

Then there was a California-based apparel company called Patagonia with a 20-year history of donating to grassroots environmental movements. First, it gave Friends of Cedar Mesa a grant. Then it produced a short film about Ewing and the unique Indigenous structures at Cedar Mesa — an area within what would eventually become the Bears Ears National Monument — that were being threatened by mining operations, looting and ignorance.

Then it stuck around. Through the creation of the monument, its contraction, its restoration and threats of another contraction, it has established itself as a major player in the tug-of-war over open spaces in Utah. The company has been shaping opinions on land use and outdoor recreation in the state for more than a decade, but that may just be the tip of the mountain.





(Katherine Frey | The Washington Post) These 800-year-old Ancestral Pueblo ruins are known as House on Fire for the smoldering color of their sandstone.

Last week, Yvon Chouinard, whose focus since he founded Patagonia in 1973 has resolutely been on protecting open spaces and combating climate change, made an unexpected but not out of character announcement. In August, he and his family donated the company’s shares to a trust and an environmentally focused nonprofit. The gesture will allow Patagonia to perpetuate its role as an environmental advocate around the globe for generations to come. In Utah, it should keep Patagonia in the fight to protect Bears Ears and may even allow the company to play a larger role in determining how the state preserves and manages its public lands going forward.

“Whether history is written now or in the future,” said Peter Metcalf, the former CEO of Black Diamond, a major brand in climbing and backcountry ski gear based in Salt Lake City, “the impact that Patagonia has had in this state on business as a whole, on the outdoor industry and conservation will be profound.”

Embedded in Utah

Patagonia’s environmental ethos, Metcalf says, has been literally embedded in the crags and mountains across Utah far longer than the company has been in the public eye.

Chouinard started as a climber, and the more durable and versatile pitons, carabiners, ice picks and crampons he famously constructed in a backyard tin shed didn’t just sprout the formation of Patagonia and its offshoot, Black Diamond. It also expanded climbing of all types out to more people across a greater variety of terrain — including throughout the mountains and deserts of Utah. Environmental awareness came as part and parcel of that movement.

“The process of becoming an environmentalist and thinking of a product and your impact in the world began with: You can’t be a successful climber without being in tune with nature,” Metcalf said. “Nature had to allow you to pass. You didn’t conquer a mountain.”

Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune Peter Metcalf, president of Black Diamond CEO, addresses the crowd, as Lawmakers and environmental and public lands advocates rally against the public lands transfer in the capitol rotunda, Monday, March 2, 2015

Metcalf also brought much of Chouinard’s activism with him when he moved Black Diamond to Salt Lake City in 1989. Few outdoor companies were making the state their home at that time. Yet Metcalf said he understood that placing the company closer to areas rich in climbing and backcountry skiing would allow it to be more innovative and in-tune with its customers while also positioning it to champion policies that would benefit them.

“It was all based upon what Patagonia did,” said Metcalf, the former general manager of Chouinard Equipment, the climbing gear maker from whose ashes Black Diamond was formed. “I mean, this is what you do.”

Metcalf also spearheaded bringing the nascent Outdoor Retailer show to Utah. He said he did it to highlight the state’s natural assets, vindicate his decision to move Black Diamond here and show off his company’s campus in the shadow of the Wasatch Mountains.

That same show, years later, first thrust Patagonia’s connection to Utah into the national spotlight.

Bears Ears and boycotts

Most of Patagonia’s early work in Utah was through its “1% for the Planet” initiative, which provided grants to grassroots programs like the one it gave to Friends of Cedar Mesa in 2012. Ewing’s group supported a movement spearheaded by a coalition of five Indigenous tribes to gain federal protection of 1.4 million acres of culturally, recreationally and yes, minerally rich land near Blanding. In December 2016, then-President Barack Obama designated Bears Ears as a national monument.

But just a few months later, after Utah lawmakers asked former President Donald Trump to repeal the national monument status given to Bears Ears, Patagonia could no longer stay in the shadows. Saying the outdoor industry should not support a state that does not support recreation, Patagonia and Black Diamond led a boycott of the Outdoor Retailer show and pushed for it to be relocated. The following year, the show — which has been estimated to have an economic impact of about $40 million annually — found a new home in Denver.

Throughout the dust-up, Patagonia retained its brick-and-mortar store in Sugar House, where it has had a presence since 1986. According to spokesperson J.J. Huggins, the store helps fund 13 local environmentally focused nonprofits, including Wasatch Community Gardens and the Salt Lake section of the American Alpine Club.

When its five-year contract with Denver expired last year, Outdoor Retailer’s organizers opted to return to Salt Lake City. The winter show is scheduled to be held at the Salt Palace in January despite the threat of boycott from at least two dozen major brands. Again, Patagonia led the charge.

“When you had Black Diamond working hard at something, and then you get Patagonia putting it front and center, that’s like putting the spinnaker up on a boat in high wind,” Metcalf said. “And everybody else is like, ‘Follow that boat! We’re jumping on that campaign. Like, that’s important.’

“And it just galvanized the industry. And it brought so much national attention to it.”

But that’s not where the retailer’s efforts ended. Patagonia had staked itself to Bears Ears, and it wasn’t going down without a fight.

A year after the monument was created, Trump acquiesced to state lawmakers’ requests. He slashed Bears Ears to 15% of its original size while also cutting in half the 1.7-million-acre Grand Staircase Escalante, a nearby area that had been given national monument status in 1996 by former President Bill Clinton. The New York Times reported that interests in oil and gas mining in protected parts of Bears Ears factored into the Trump administration’s decision to shrink the monuments.

(Francisco Kjolseth | The Salt Lake Tribune) President Donald Trump is surrounded by Utah representatives at the Utah Capitol on Monday, Dec. 4, 2017, after signing two presidential proclamations to shrink Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments.

Patagonia had braced for the move and quickly filed a lawsuit against Trump and the heads of several agencies, including Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, the director of the Bureau of Land Management and the chief of the Forest Service. It argued that the Antiquities Act of 1906 that was used by Obama to create the monuments did not also give a president the power to reduce them.

“They said to the state of Utah, ‘Give us all what you got because we’re going to be in this from the thick and thin in the beginning to the end. And we’re going to apply not just nominal but real and substantive resources and get involved in the litigation,’” said Pat Gonzales-Rogers, the former inaugural executive director of the Bears Ears Intertribal Coalition. “So there is no doubt they took a step that was quite bold and quite assertive for a company that has actually a for-profit bottom line.

“And that’s an incredible kind of movement that goes over and above a mere gesture.”

Gonzales-Rogers’ opinion does not reflect that of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, nor the Bears Ears Commission. The coalition, through co-director Charissa Wahwasuck-Jessepe, declined to comment for this story.

As of 2018, Patagonia had spent about $2 million to protect Bears Ears, according to a report by the New York Times. Yet the company armed the campaign with two other tools that likely carried even more value: its sway within the outdoor community and its high profile.

The concerted effort by the tribes was credited by Metcalf, Gonzales-Rogers and Ewing as the driving force behind the creation of the monuments. As many as 30 tribes have joined together to advocate for the preservation of the lands, on which are found a trove of ancient dwellings, petroglyphs and fossils. But, Gonzales-Rogers said Patagonia’s involvement brought the struggle into the public eye. It generated interest with a larger audience and gave the tribal coalition access to rooms from which it might have otherwise been excluded.

“It really lent license and voice to those particular areas that tribe could not speak to,” said Gonzales-Rogers, now a lecturer at the Yale School of Environment. “And so, their amplification as well as their support philosophically — as well as monetarily — was really critical because it really showed that this is an issue that crossed against borders.”

(Zak Podmore | The Salt Lake Tribune) Board members, staff and supporters of the Indigenous-led group Utah Diné Bikéyah celebrate President Joe Biden’s decision to restore the boundaries of Bears Ears National Monument at an overlook on Cedar Mesa in San Juan County on Friday, Oct. 8, 2021.

At the same time, the company’s decades-long effort to urge its customers to think beyond how an action will affect their outdoor playground to how it will affect the environment as a whole gained momentum. The film about Ewing, who moved to the area because of its climbing, played into that.

“We needed to get the people who were recreating at Bears Ears to be engaged in the advocacy and to support the tribes,” Ewing said. He added, “We knew with the politics in Utah, there had to be a broad coalition of people asking the Obama administration and Congress to protect it if it was ever going to happen.”

President Joe Biden restored both monuments to their original size in 2021, less than a year after taking office. However, earlier this year state Attorney General Sean Reyes led an all-Republican contingent of state leaders, including Gov. Spencer Cox, in filing a lawsuit challenging the monument designation and, more broadly, the Antiquities Act. They argue that the size of the monuments makes them unwieldy and that they would be better managed locally than at the federal level.

So the stage is set for another act in this drama, but this time Patagonia may play an even larger role.

‘Going purpose’

In his letter to Patagonia customers, Chouinard wrote last week, “Instead of ‘going public,’ you could say we’re ‘going purpose.’”

The letter detailed the company’s latest step in its mission to serve as a vessel for saving the planet. Chouinard, his wife and two children donated their voting shares to a trust that they and their advisors will oversee and which will ensure Patagonia remains true to its environment-first directive. They donated the other 98% of the company’s shares, and therefore all of its annual profits to an environmentally focused nonprofit called the Holdfast Collective.

The Chouinards will pay about $17.5 million in taxes on the $3 billion gift, though Bloomberg estimates they will avoid hundreds of thousands of dollars in future taxes. A similar donation of shares of a $1.6 billion electronics company made last year by entrepreneur Barre Seid to a conservative nonprofit — one that works against climate change legislation among other issues — was structured it in such a way that Seid will not owe any taxes from it.

After Trump's decision, Patagonia posted ""The President Stole Your Land"" on its home page. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)

The Holdfast Collective is a 501(c)(4), which means it can make unlimited political contributions, including for lobbying and to support or oppose candidates or legislation. If Patagonia continues to generate its current revenues, the nonprofit will have about $100 million to donate each year. By one estimate, that would place it among the 10 richest conservation organizations in the world.

Metcalf called it a “turbocharger” for the company’s enterprises.

“Money is the lubricant of politics,” he said. “And without the ability to fund campaigns and give to elected officials, you [can be] seriously handicapped. … That ability to fund educational campaigns and political officials? That is super powerful.”

Will Patagonia continue to use those funds to fight for federal protection of lands and expansion of recreational access in Utah? The short answer appears to be yes.

“We will continue to work with Tribes, grassroots activists and outdoor athletes to protect Bears Ears and other special places around Utah,” Huggins, the company spokesperson, said in an email, “and to work on the root causes of the climate crisis.”

If history — including a decade advocating for Bears Ears — is any indication, Patagonia will see this struggle to its end.

CNN —

For travelers itching to go on an adventure, to reconnect with nature or to feel like they are the only humans for miles and miles, Patagonia is one of the last untouched places on Earth.

This remote region covers hundreds of thousands of square miles of southern Argentina and Chile, stretching across ancient forests, vast glaciers, deep fjords and the jagged Andes mountains.

Patagonia is home to diverse wildlife including pumas, penguins and parrots. There is kayaking, trekking, biking, climbing, rafting and snorkeling – even alongside sea lion pups.

“This is a place for people who like an adventure. You can feel the wind and feel the sea,” said Kevin Zaouali, one of the directors of the new CNN Original Series “Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World.” “In Patagonia, you feel alone in this huge world of wildlife.”

Here are some of the must-see places at the end of the world:

Torres del Paine National Park is a paradise for nature lovers, hikers and climbers. Ana Fernandez/AFP/Getty Images

Torres del Paine National Park, Chile

Torres del Paine National Park is a crown jewel of Chile’s park system. It has miles-long glaciers, turquoise-blue lakes, granite peaks towering up to more than 9,400 feet, stunning waterfalls and rare wildlife.

“There are very few places in the world that are so pristine, so unspoiled,” said Camilo Rada, a scientist and mountaineer from Chile.

This park is one of the most sparsely populated regions in the world, where wildlife must be resilient to survive its punishing and unpredictable extremes. There are condors, wild horses, rheas, guanacos and pumas.

“This is one of the best places in the world to see these pumas. Everywhere else they are afraid of people, but not here. They don’t have any predators – there are no wolves or bears, so they are pretty chilled,” René Araneda, former guide and director of “Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World,” told CNN. “Torres del Paine National Park is probably my favorite place in the world.”

It’s estimated that the park and surrounding area is home to hundreds of pumas.

The park is also home to some of the region’s best trekking, including the W Trek (50 miles) and O Circuit (68 miles). Summer is the ideal time for hiking, which is November to March in the Southern Hemisphere.

For accommodations, two great options are the world’s first geodesic dome hotel, called EcoCamp Patagonia, and the upscale Explora lodge.

Península Valdés and El Pedral, Argentina

More than 700 miles northeast of Torres del Paine on the Argentinean coastline, Península Valdés is another wildlife lover’s paradise. At the UNESCO World Heritage Site, visitors can see orcas, southern right whales, elephant seals, sea lions, Magellanic penguins and countless birds.

Zaouali recommends taking a boat ride to see the southern right whales up close. These slow, peaceful giants got their name because they were once known as the “right ones” to hunt.



The orcas, on the other hand, can be seen from the beaches of Península Valdés.

“It’s the best place in the world to see orcas,” Zaouali said. “If you go, you’ll be in real contact with the wildlife.”

Punta Norte, on the northern tip of the peninsula, is one of the only places in the world where orcas come ashore to hunt unsuspecting seals and sea lion pups. Only two orca pods know this ingenious hunting trick.

First, they swim sideways to hide their dorsal fins, then beach themselves to snap up their meal and finally maneuver back into the sea. This happens in March and April, and the risky feat is stunning to see.

In El Pedral, about 30 miles south, there is a growing penguin colony.

“If you are there, you’re alone in a huge penguin colony. It’s the best place to stay if you want to experience Patagonia on a different level,” Zaouali told CNN, calling the spot magical.

There are over 12,000 Magellanic penguins, conservationist Popi García said in CNN’s “Patagonia” series.

“One of the favorite penguins in this colony is called Clarita,” García said, “We know that she’s about 16 years old. She was able to raise 14 chicks.”

September to April is the best time to see the penguins when these migratory waddlers come to breed.

Los Glaciares National Park, Argentina

Located in the southwest of Santa Cruz province in the Argentine Andes, Los Glaciares National Park is defined by its numerous glaciers.

The most famous is the Perito Moreno Glacier – extending 19 miles in length, three miles in width and 560 in depth, according to the Global Alliance of National Parks.

Zaouali compared the icy wonder to “The Wall” in “Game of Thrones.”

“It’s a huge spectacle to see,” said Zaouali. He recommends visiting in the spring and summer, when it’s melting, to see and hear the huge chunks of the wall breaking off in front of your eyes.

Standing at over 11,000 feet, Mount Fitz Roy is the highest peak in the park. For jaw-dropping views of the mountain, hikers walk the steep 13-mile Fitz Roy trek.

Horseback riding, kayaking, biking and climbing also offer panoramic views of the awe-inspiring park.

The northern Argentinian village of Balneario El Cóndor is home to the world’s largest parrot colony, according to the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

After wintering up north, pairs of burrowing parrots return to the same nest every spring. Some of their nests stretch back ten feet into the cliffs. There are 37,000 active nests, conservationist Mauricio Failla said in the “Patagonia” series.

These green, yellow and blue birds are very social and vocal, which is why Failla loves studying them.

Other local attractions on the coast of the Río Negro province include the sandy beaches and the Faro Río Negro lighthouse.

There is kite surfing, windsurfing and sand yachting, which is a wheeled vehicle with a sail that’s powered across the sand by the wind.

Chiloé Island, Chile

Chile’s Chiloé Island offers some of the best whale sightings in the region. The beautiful surrounding fjords are a magnet for wildlife, including sea lions, dolphins and the largest animal that has ever lived: blue whales.

Summer is the best time to see the endangered blue whales; it’s when they gather along the Pacific Coast to feast on krill. The nearly 200-ton whales will eat four tons of krill a day.

“Seeing a blue whale never gets boring. It’s always a thrill,” oceanographer Susannah Buchan told CNN. “It’s always amazing and emotional and a complete privilege.”

There are 700 migrating whales that come to this region every year from January to April.

Buchan recommends whale watchers visit in February. But she warns it’s a vast and dynamic feeding ground, so sightings are not guaranteed. Sometimes she won’t see whales for a couple of weeks.

A trip to Chiloé Island is not complete without soaking up the culture. There is a large indigenous community, rooted in deep traditions. Fishing and tourism are top industries for locals.

The island is famous for its picturesque palafitos, wooden houses on stilts above the water. There are even stilted hotels and restaurants that tourists can visit.

The area is also known for its delicious seafood. One of the traditional Chilean dishes is curanto, a feast of meat and seafood that’s cooked in a pit in the ground and covered by a large leaf. It’s one big communal pot of clams, mussels, sausage, potatoes, chicken and pork.

Buchan advises passing on Chilean salmon, which is not native to the region. There are no natural salmon in the Southern Hemisphere, so the local salmon is farmed. Overcrowding in the pens has led to disease among the salmon, she said, and big-scale escapes, damaging native fish communities and devastating the marine ecosystem.

Back on the mainland east of the island lies Pumalín Park, Chile’s largest private nature reserve. The park once belonged to North Face founder Douglas Tompkins but was donated to the country of Chile. This park is free to visit. This lush and temperate rainforest with crystal clear rivers is a stunning area for outdoor enthusiasts.

Carretera Austral, Chile

If you’re looking for a road trip through especially off-the-beaten-path parts of Patagonia, the Carretera Austral route takes drivers more than 700 scenic miles from Puerto Montt in the Lakes District south to Villa O’Higgins in the Aysén region.

The road, at times unpaved and requiring ferries, passes through small remote villages and enormously diverse landscapes on what many consider Patagonia’s finest road trip.

One of “Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World” director Araneda’s favorite places in Patagonia is at the route’s southern end – the Aysén region. This forested area – encompassing several iconic parks including Pumalín Park and Laguna San Rafael National Park – is considered a biodiversity hotspot and new species are still being discovered here.

“This is one of the most unexplored places in the world,” Araneda said. “It looks like a jungle, like Costa Rica, but in a cold environment with the ocean and mountains.”

Estancias throughout Patagonia

For a unique experience, ranches called estancia offer traditional lodging throughout Patagonia.

Visitors can embrace the solitude of life as a gaucho, a native horseman that personifies the frontier spirit.

For horseback riding and fly fishing, the 100,000-acre Estancia Ranquilco in northwest Patagonia offers lodge stays and backcountry horse treks.

Another option is Tipiliuke, located in Argentina’s Chimehuín river valley in northwest Patagonia. There’s fly fishing, horseback riding, hiking, yoga, golfing, mountain biking, rafting, bird watching and even skiing at the nearby Chapelco ski area. The estancia’s chef is known for her empanadas.

Estancias offer the perfect opportunity to try authentic cuisine. One of the main staples is Argentinian barbecue known as asado.

In southern Chile, Estancia Cerro Guido stretches across 247,000 acres. Guests can experience the daily life of gauchos – spending time in the orchards and horse stables – and be immersed in local conservation work. The activities include driving 4x4, riding horses around Torres del Paine and joining puma trackers as they monitor this top predators’ daily movements and research how the big cats can coexistence with the ranches.

“The puma and the gaucho have always been enemies,” gaucho and puma tracker Mirko Utrovicic said in the series. “I think the most important thing is to realize that times change. Look at what surrounds us. We have to give them their space back.”",['Janelle Davis'],2022-07-09 16:23:21+00:00

American graduate student Cassandra “Cassy” Doolittle died over Christmas, while on a climbing trip in El Chaltén. Doolittle had just finished a solo of the Comesaña-Fonrouge (IV 5.10d; 1,300ft) on the northwest arete of the 8,500-foot spire Aguja Guillaumet in the Fitz Roy massif. She was caught by a fast-moving storm while descending.

Doolittle sent out a distress beacon at approximately 10:00 p.m. that evening, after becoming disoriented amid the high winds and heavy precipitation. She had descended the full length of the route but rappelled slightly past the walk-off point to access her base camp. She sheltered beneath an overhanging ledge and waited for rescue. Search and rescue efforts were delayed due to the heavy storm, and initial responders concentrated their search efforts higher on the wall, on the route itself.

“With this weather blowing in, she was likely hypothermic and dehydrated,” her mother, Pam Doolittle, told Climbing, “and I’m sure somewhat disoriented and scared. [So] she rappelled further down [than she should have]. But where she landed, she could’ve gotten out, she just was too disoriented and exhausted.” Doolittle said her daughter’s body was ultimately found below the end of her rope at the base of the wall, at approximately 6,500 feet, under a ledge where she’d attempted to take cover from the storm. The autopsy indicated death from exposure, with no evidence of a fall or other trauma.

Born on May 24, 1997, in Madison, Wisconsin, Cassy Doolittle attended school in Sauk City, a small town northwest of Madison, after her family moved to nearby Mazomanie in 2001. She later went to college at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, graduating with double majors in psychology and vocal performance and a minor in biology.

Doolittle began climbing at the Adventure Rock gym in Milwaukee, and later ventured to nearby Devil’s Lake State Park, “where she discovered her love for trad climbing, learning to trust her head and try hard over small cams and nuts,” said friend and climbing partner Hans Beuttler. At the time of her death, Doolittle was a third-year graduate student at the University of Las Vegas, pursuing a Ph.D. in neuroscience (and the pristine sandstone at the nearby mecca Red Rock Canyon).

This trip was Doolittle’s first time in El Chaltén, and “she’d just recently gotten comfortable in the alpine in the [Bugaboos] this last summer,” said Gardner. She’d initially planned to travel to Argentina with a partner, but when her second backed out of the trip, Doolittle decided to shift focus to easier objectives she felt comfortable soloing.

Many of Doolittle’s close friends and climbing partners reached out to Climbing to contribute to this memoriam. Their words painted a picture of a tenacious climber with a deep passion for the wild spaces of the planet, and a dedicated, caring friend.

***

In a tribute shared with Climbing, Madeleine Gardner recalled meeting Doolittle in El Potrero Chico, after driving down to the Mexican crag alone. “I hadn’t really gotten in with any group yet,” she said. “I was taking a shower at camp and this girl I’d seen around poked her head in and [said] ‘Yeah it’s mostly clear,’ [to someone] behind her. Within seconds, a few boys followed her inside. She sat on the countertop, looking quite bored as they began stitching up some wounds on her body, [which] I hadn’t even noticed because of her dulled expression.”

Gardner was impressed with Doolittle’s toughness, which she later learned was in response to a 100-foot fall. It was only a few days before the two would connect around a group bonfire, spawning the beginnings of a fast friendship.

A few months later, both were in Index with a similar group of friends. “I’m someone who strays on the outskirts of the crew … [and] Cassy was one of those rare people that sought out those who were hard to find,” Gardner said. “I remember the way she looked at me as I spoke one day by the river, when a few of us girls gathered to share stories of trauma. Sometime that week, she decided we were to be very intimate friends … We started sharing all our secrets with each other.”

Cassy was an all-around climber, but she was particularly stoked on the trad around Red Rock, said Gardner, a place where “she [could] lead rope solo a lot of things when she didn’t have a partner [which] made her feel capable and powerful.”

Doolittle often reflected on the sense of empowerment and community she found in climbing, said Gardner. “Often while having [group] dinners she would say how thankful she was to have met each one of us and how much it meant to her to have our friendship.”

“I remember she pulled me aside one night after she and the boys did some group soloing—saying how they all had this epiphany midway up the route that they just didn’t want to be doing this right now. Collectively humbled, they all bailed together. [Doolittle] was awestruck by the community she felt at that moment.”

Doolittle was talented and motivated beyond her climbing, with passions ranging from cooking to writing to music. Her mother fondly recalled her early passion for hockey, how Doolittle insisted on playing on the boys’ youth hockey team for as long as she was allowed. “She was ‘The Great Wall of China,’ a force the forwards contended with as they made attempts on goal.”

A skilled musician and vocalist, Doolittle was remembered by the Sauk Prairie Music Association as “kindness in human form … She was the student that stood up to bullies and welcomed everyone into the group. She was the person younger students would seek out for advice or support. She was musically gifted, [with] a style unlike anyone we have ever worked with.”

This versatility and expansive interest resulted in an individual equally guided by both logic and passion. “Cassie was very, very smart,” Gardner said. “An academic type, rational… but [also] forever fascinated by the illogical, magical side of things. She always wanted me to read her horoscope. She was fascinated by the idea of embodying a two-headed Gemini. She felt the duality of her mind a lot.”

Hans Beuttler, one of Doolittle’s regular climbing partners, remembered her for an “energy on and off the wall [that] was contagious. Climbing with [Doolittle] was always full of laughter and enthusiasm,” he said, “no matter how hard the challenge.”

“Cassy didn’t believe in Type 2 fun,” he added. “She said that climbing was all fun. No matter how big the adventure, she would be smiling and excited the entire time, which would only motivate those around her to try harder.”

Doolittle’s trip to El Chaltén was, in many ways, the fulfillment of a dream she’d carried throughout her climbing life, Beuttler said. “Cassy never imagined that she would ever make it to Patagonia. The place she saw as a paradise for climbing, she turned into her reality. Although her feelings at her end will forever be unknown, I like to believe that she climbed to the top of Guillaumet with the same passion and love for the mountains she always had.”

“When I think of Cassy now, it simultaneously aches and warms my heart,” said friend and climbing partner Bailey Spears. “She was sweet and had a voice that became squealy with excitement in a pleasant way. When it came to climbing, she became fiery. It amazed me how one person could embody such polar states. In addition to Cassy being an amazing human and strong climber, she was an incredible partner.

“She was fun, considerate, and encouraging. She was dialed on her rope systems, fast and smart. She was willing to take any pitch, even if it was rainy or scary. Cassy was basically every good quality you could use to describe a person and mixed in, she had this mysteriously beautiful and powerful style of doing everything.”

Spears remembered the first time she belayed Doolittle, who had chosen to lead the entire route using only nuts for protection. “I still feel that is fitting of her: playful, different, and bold. She was the most inspirational woman I have ever climbed with. Her persistence and commitment were astounding. Cassy could work herself to complete exhaustion, and even then, I don’t think quitting would be a thought that crossed her mind.”

Like Gardner and Beuttler, Spears recalled a woman who loved her friends deeply, without condition. She mentioned one occasion last summer, when a large group of their friends gathered to celebrate a birthday, and Doolittle just broke down into tears, smiling. She ultimately laughed and explained, “I just love you so much.”

“I know this isn’t the only friend she would cry for out of a full heart,” said Spears. “Cassy astounds me, inspires me, and forever will. She was wild and courageous; any other way wouldn’t have been her. She has, and always will have, an immense amount of love from the people that know her.”

Trinity Robinson met Doolittle three years ago, “by what felt like more than sheer coincidence.” While cragging in Las Vegas, Robinson met a climber, Chris, who recognized her from somewhere. Eventually, she realized they both were from southeast Wisconsin, and had met at Devil’s Lake. When Chris and his partner Grant picked Robinson up to go climbing two days later, Robinson opened the car door to find Doolittle in the front seat, taking a Zoom call for her graduate class.

“Once Cass finished her call, she promptly began asking [us] numerous questions. I was immediately hooked by her overall stoke, the way she cared about what I had to say, and … how much we had in common. As it turns out, we played hockey against one another in high school, growing up just an hour and a half apart.”

“She refused to let anything get in the way of her goals,” said Robinson, “and, oh boy, did she have a lot of them. The whiteboard in her room in Vegas laid out her dreams and objectives including a timeline and partners. We shared a similar psyche, understanding, skill, and goal orientation, though, I was nowhere near as organized. We made plans that, to me, felt like unattainable dreams, but promptly started ticking them off.”

By the spring, the pair had climbed in Joshua Tree, Red Rock, and Yosemite Valley. Though Doolittle had much less time to climb than many of her friends, amid a full-time schedule as a graduate student, “I swear she climbed more than almost anyone, including those living full-time on the road,” said Robinson. “She would drive eight hours after Friday lecture or lab, sleep for four hours or so, climb the Rostrum the next morning, and return to Vegas by Monday. Sometimes, if she could swing it, Cass would take meetings while belaying and even multi-pitching.”

The pair climbed together less in recent months, as Doolittle remained in Vegas to pursue grad school and Robinson stayed in Yosemite to climb full-time, but “Cass’ skill was skyrocketing,” Robinson said. “She was doing everything she set her sights on and never gave up. It seems as though we both improved like crazy, leading up to our ascent of the Nose on El Cap in November 2021.”

The pair had the wall almost entirely to themselves, and with dead phones they kept spirits high by singing songs from the Disney film Moana. “I was working at the Valley daycare at the time,” said Robinson, “and Cass had the voice of an angel. If I do say so myself, it was one of the cutest ascents the Captain had ever seen.”

The next spring, Doolittle went for the Nose in a day. “Of course, it was a success. It always seemed to be,” said Robinson.

For Doolittle’s birthday that May, the pair attempted a one-day ascent of the Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome. Despite a bungled approach, the team eventually fired up the wall, catching up to four separate parties. “I spent two hours standing on a micro ledge, on lead, waiting,” said Robinson. “We were moving so slowly it was certain we would top out well past dark. We decided to chill and sleep on the wall, though not too much sleep was had on our little ledge.”

“We spent that night watching the sun set behind the granite walls, talking about life, love, risk, and happiness. I always felt these were the best, most real talks I have had with almost anyone. We would be so exhausted that the feelings and words would just flow. Our friendship and comfort around one another grew past our climbing partnership. I know well that many of Cass’ other partners felt this way too. She had steadfast emotional intelligence and genuine care for what you had to say.”

Robinson last saw her close friend at Hidden Valley in Joshua Tree. “We frothed over the future with heart-eye emojis and, in my mind, I truly thought we would be those old ladies at the crag, still crushing, still psyched, still exuding a seemingly unstoppable youthfulness.”

“As it turns out, this time of our twenties, this ‘nothing can hurt us’ energy is a farce. I naively thought this couldn’t happen to us … In the grand scheme of time and partnerships, Cass’ and mine was brief, yet resounding.”

Robinson said she has recently found herself connecting with more and more of Doolittle’s former climbing partners. “[Her] stoke and kindness attracted so many wonderful humans, just as it attracted me … We all share an immense and unforgettable love for our partner. And we freaking miss her like crazy.”

Family friend Desiree Bates set up a GoFundMe shortly after the accident to raise funds for Doolittle’s recovery and funeral. The initiative has since vastly exceeded its fundraising goal, but an update from the family indicated that further funds will be used to “find a way to fuel the fires of other adventurers and explorers, the same way Cassy inspired the world of people around her … to support and honor the communities who [did so for] the woman that Cassy became.”

In addition to her large and loving network of friends and climbing partners, Cassy is survived by her parents, Daniel and Pamela, younger sister Nichole, older brother Kevin, sister-in-law Amanda, and niece Quinn. At the time of writing, the Doolittle family had traveled to Argentina to recover their daughter’s body.

In a tribute shared with Climbing, Doolittle’s brother, Kevin, expounded on the meaning of “stoke” and how his little sister embodied the word. “It feels pretty much impossible right now, but we need to keep her fire alive,” he said. “She would want my mom to feel the stoke when she is showing her horse Contigo this summer … She would want my dad to solo [pilot] his first airplane, and feel the stoke … She would want me and my little sister Nichole to grow close [and get stoked on] whale watching together…”

“She was taken far too soon… But if we can, and I know it seems totally impossible, we NEED to feel some of her STOKE, because that is what she would want.”

In the close of her contributions to this obituary, Gardner recalled how shortly after Doolittle’s 100-footer in Potrero, another climber, a schoolteacher, died in a fall while she and Doolittle were still there. “Everyone was shocked, but it didn’t last,” Gardner said. “Cassy couldn’t stand how easily everyone forgot about the tragedy, and she wrote about it a lot. [She] wondered constantly if her fate would be the same after she passed.”

“[Cassy] I love you forever,” she wrote. “Not just for a little while. This love won’t fade.”",['Anthony Walsh'],2023-01-18 20:07:18+00:00

Why shop Patagonia?

Some of the programs include the Ironclad Guarantee, product recycling program Worn Wear, and a commitment since 1985 to donate 1% of sales to preservation and restoration efforts through 1% for the Planet.

What is Patagonia's Ironclad Guarantee?

Patagonia has built their product to last. As such, they guarantee any product they make. If you’re not happy with your purchase, you have a few options to choose from: You can return the item to the store or online to get a full refund; you can request a replacement in-store or online; or, for minor damage, you can request a DIY repair kit to be sent to you (or you can take it into stores).

What is the repair process like?

With every purchase, you can get a free repair. (Note that repairs to highly technical items such as wetsuits may incur a fee.). For small tears or holes, Patagonia will send you a patch kit. For larger issues, stores can do minor repairs on site or you can send it in to their repair team in Reno, Nevada—you cover the shipping cost.

https://www.climbing.com/gear/patagonias-venga-rock-pants/,Field Tested: Patagonia’s Venga Rock Pants,"The Vengas are hands down my favorite climbing pants right now. But if I think I’ll be heading to the pub after the crag, I certainly pack a spare pair of jeans.

Because of flexible waistband I NEEDED to wear a belt when carrying a phone & wallet // The color faded relatively quickly and cotton micro-pilled // Pants looked rather old and schlubby long before they actually began degrading // Expensive

Patagonia’s Venga Rock Pants are climbing pants—pure and simple. They’re not the sort of fancy hybrid jeans that will serve you equally well at the gym and some overpriced gastropub. They’re rock pants, designed with mobility in mind, and they look like it—borrowing, as the name suggests,* from Europe’s colorful sport-pant tradition.

* “Venga, Chris! Venga!”

Designed to maximize lightness and flexibility without sacrificing durability, the Venga has roomy, articulated knees (accomplished thanks to a “dart” sewn into the medial pant leg) and a partially elastic waistband; they’re delightful beneath a harness; the gusseted crotch and spandex-cotton blend keep them from splitting a seam when you try to highstep or stem widely; I recommend them highly.

Features I especially liked

The Waistband: I like a lot about these pants, but my favorite feature (though it’s not without its drawbacks) is probably the partially elasticated waistband. The elastic in the waist snugs the pants around your waist–but not too tightly, since only part of the pants waistline is elastic. The elastic also lends flexibility to the waist and hip, which does two things. First, it allows you to step or high-step without resistance from your pants. Second, it takes pressure off the snap closure, which means that your pants won’t come unsnapped mid ascent. (There exists a video, which you will never see, of me doing a boulder problem in Red Rock, Nevada, and having my cragging pants—not made by Patagonia—come unsnapped mid-problem; I still sent, but the topout wasn’t pretty.) The one downside of the elastic waistband is that, well, my pants fall down when I’ve got wallet, keys, and cell phone in the pockets, so I have to wear a belt, though I ditch it (with the wallet, keys, and phone) before climbing.

The adjustable cuffs: The Venga has adjustable cuffs which allow you to climb without rolling up the hem of your pants, and, more crucially, make you at least look like a fashionable European climber—Stefano Ghisolfi, perhaps, or Nicky Ceria.

Another note on fashion: once I tightened my cuffs, the pants always seemed a bit crinkly at the bottom, as if the cuffs’ drawstrings were still drawn, regardless of whether they were drawn or not. Again, this isn’t gastropub attire; but if you don’t like that bloused-pant look, I’d recommend against the Venga.

Quad cell phone pocket: I almost never climb with a cell phone in my pocket, but I do do quite a bit of hiking and mountain scrambling that way, and I liked that the Venga has a zip-up pocket on the front right pant leg. The pocket situates the cell phone (or keys, or sandwich… you do you) below the hip-flexor’s crease-line, which allows you to high-step in steep terrain without feeling like your phone is resisting your movements—something I find seriously annoying. (Note: the four other pockets are also explicitly designed to lie flat and be comfortable underneath a harness.) Based on Patagonia’s photos, the quad pocket seems designed to hold a phone even when you’re wearing a harness, but my harness falls directly onto the phone and I would never climb with it in there.

Sizing

I am one of those short-legged, wide-thighed guys who struggle with pants. In some (but not all) brands, size 30 pants fit my waist but are uncomfortably tight in the quad—while size 31 feels too big, too baggy, too long. In the Venga, a size 30 fits me perfectly. As a reference point, size 30 Black Diamond jeans also fit me perfectly, whereas Prana’s pants tend to be hit or miss. Make of that what you will. As noted above, I do have to wear a belt, but that’s largely thanks to the elastic.

The downsides?

As I’ve already noted, the Venga is designed for function first, looks second. But I was a little dismayed by how quickly the pants aged. This aging was purely visual: I’ve been climbing in my Vengas consistently since April, and in that time I have not had any sort of malfunction or fabric tear… which is kind of remarkable since northern New Mexico—with its fields of cholla and prickly pear, its forests of Juniper, its razor-sharp basalt crags—is hell on clothes. But my Vengas, a rich navy blue out of the box, started fading almost immediately, especially at the seams. Even when newly washed, they look as though they’ve been beer-battered with chalk. They also micro-pill like a fleece (albeit with smaller pills), which gives them a kind of hazy, old-clothes look.

Again, I personally don’t care. The Vengas are hands down my favorite climbing pants right now. But if I think I’ll be heading to the pub after the crag, I now pack a spare pair of jeans.

Note the faded seams and overall color? These are pants without a single rip in them. (Sorry about the dog hair. That’s on me.)",['Steven Potter'],2022-12-09 02:26:18+00:00
https://newrepublic.com/article/167780/patagonia-wont-save-world-without-addressing-prior-failures,Patagonia Won’t Save the World Without Addressing Some of Its Prior Failures,"The world’s institutions—both brands and NGOs alike— welcomed the Higg MSI with open arms and little to no research. After partnering with the global NGO World Resources Institute, Higg Co., the for-profit selling the index, raised $50 million in funding in April this year, and its index full of dubious data became the accounting metric for New York’s Fashion Sustainability and Social Accountability Act. The legislation has not yet passed, but H&M is now being sued in New York for using Higg data to fleece customers with premium prices for “sustainable” clothes.

A few days after my investigation was published at The Intercept, The New York Times published a similar article, “How Fashion Giants Recast Plastic as Good for the Planet,” in which it identified Patagonia’s role in leading the organizations that have essentially rebranded petroleum-based fibers. It’s odd not to mention this context when reporting Chouinard’s decision to give the company to the fight against climate change.

Patagonia has had both successes and failures in terms of sustainability. But instead of presenting those side by side, the piece paints both Chouinard and Patagonia as pioneers of sustainability and generosity. “By giving away the bulk of their assets during their lifetime, the Chouinards …,” Gelles writes, “have established themselves as among the most charitable families in the country.” Elsewhere the piece praises Patagonia as “an early adopter of everything from organic cotton to on-site child care,” and notes that Chouinard doesn’t own a computer and “wears raggedy old clothes, drives a beat up Subaru and splits his time between modest homes in Ventura and Jackson, Wyo.”","['Rachel Donald', 'Kate Aronoff', 'Marion Renault', 'Liza Featherstone', 'Jan Dutkiewicz', 'Gabriel N.

https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/money-and-power/a41234265/yvon-chouinard-patagonia-philanthropy-news/,Reactions to Yvon Chouinard Giving Away Patagonia,"Yvon Chouinard, the billionaire founder of the outdoor clothing company Patagonia, announced on Wednesday that he, his wife, and their children had decided to turn over ownership of the global brand to a non-profit and and a trust that will use all of Patagonia's annual profits to fund environmental-based initiatives. It is one of the largest (Patagonia makes profits of approximately $100 million a year) and most unusual philanthropic gifts (despite its new mission, Patagonia will remain a for-profit company) in recent memory.

""Earth is now our only shareholder"" Chouinard wrote in a message that appears on Patagonia's website. ""Instead of 'going public,' you could say we’re 'going purpose.' Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth.""

The response to Chouinard's announcement was almost universally ecstatic. ""This is the Correct Response to Being a Billionaire,"" proclaimed The Cut. ""Yvon Chouinard has now shown that he is willing to put his money where his mouth is, by giving the company away in an effort to fight environmental crises,"" declared Time. ""You would trade your elite billionaire status to save THIS planet?"" joked a Washington Post opinion writer.

Chouinard has a long history of using his company to fund environmental initiatives. Since 1985, Patagonia has donated 1 percent of sales to environment-related programs. It has targeted specific issues, notably removing derelict dams from rivers to help restore wild fish populations, and offered to pay bail for employees who are arrested at peaceful environmental protests.

Control of the outdoor apparel and equipment retailer Patagonia is being passed to two charitable foundations to direct any company profit not reinvested into fighting climate change.

This may amount to about $100 million (€100.38 million) a year.

The 83-year-old founder of Patagonia, Yvon Chouinard, announced the decision on Wednesday in a statement titled: ""Earth is now our only shareholder.""

""Despite its immensity, the Earth's resources are not infinite, and it's clear we've exceeded its limits. But it's also resilient. We can save our planet if we commit to it,"" he said.

Chouinard said that he looked at the option of selling the company and donating the money but he was not confident if the new owners would maintain Patagonia's values built over the years.

The other option of going public was rejected, with Chouinard saying that it would have been a ""disaster.""

Patagonia founder seeks 'new form of capitalism'

In an interview with The New York Times, Chouinard said that he hoped that his example would ""influence a new form of capitalism that doesn't end up with a few rich people and a bunch of poor people.""

Founded in 1973, the company based in Ventura, California, is valued at around $3 billion according to the paper.

Patagonia has maintained sustainable standards by sourcing its raw materials and donating 1% of its sales to environmental organizations.

While the company's voting shares — belonging to the Chouinard family — would go to a trust in charge of upholding Patagonia's environmental values, the non-voting shares were transferred to a nonprofit fighting climate change.

The Chouinard family will be on the board of the company but will not get any money from it, according to the announcement. They will oversee the trust and guide the nonprofit's philanthropic work.

Corporate leadership takes many forms. This week, Ryan Gellert, the CEO of the outerwear company Patagonia, demonstrated leadership on the issue of climate change, when he voiced strong public support for legislation Congress is about to consider called the Inflation Reduction Act.

The bill would provide federal funds to support technologies that address climate change. To cover the cost, it would add new taxes — notably, requiring all companies with annual revenue of more than $1 billion to pay a minimum corporate tax of 15%. This new tax would yield about $300 billion over 10 years. About 70 companies would be required to pay increased taxes, according to a study prepared last year for Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.).

On August 3, Gellert announced his support for the 15% minimum tax, which in his view is an appropriate new revenue source to advance national climate goals. He went out of his way to embrace Senator Joe Manchin’s statement that “it is wrong that some of America’s largest companies pay nothing in taxes while freely enjoying the benefits of our nation’s military security, infrastructure and rule of law.”

Manchin, of course, is the conservative Democrat from West Virginia who for months had held up the Biden Administration’s climate initiative out of concern for his home state’s coal and natural gas industries and his claim that the environmental plan would add to the national debt and exacerbate inflation. In late July, Manchin agreed to a slimmed-down $369 billion climate-and-energy package which includes concessions to fossil fuel companies and, when combined with the proposed 15% minimum corporate tax, strikes the West Virginian as fiscally responsible.

Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.), another holdout, tentatively agreed this week to lend her support to the bill, provided that the 15% corporate tax is restructured somewhat to favor manufacturers, among other changes. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in 2020 more than 50 of the largest companies in the United States, including FedEx FDX , Archer-Daniels-Midland and Salesforce, paid zero in federal income taxes.

In recent years, hundreds of US-based companies claim to have “gone green,” extolling the virtues of reducing carbon emissions and proclaiming their commitment to “sustainable” energy policies. Corporate websites are replete with sustainability reports describing in detail how companies are reducing their carbon footprints.

By the end of this decade, it is estimated that more than $30 trillion will be held in ESG investment funds globally. Part of their stated mission is to track environmental, social, and governmental issues, with a heavy focus on whether companies are reducing carbon emissions. While many of these efforts are well intentioned — some are mostly public relations — they certainly are not sufficient.

Companies alone cannot solve our climate crisis. The government has an essential role to play, and it needs added resources to do its job well. This is what the proposed climate legislation does, offering $369 billion in new federal funds, part of which will support new investments in US wind farms, solar panels and other clean energy options. The bill also will provide tax incentives and rebates to individual consumers, for example, those from lower income brackets who purchase electric vehicles.

These measures require new sources of public funding. That's where the proposed minimum corporate tax on the largest companies comes in. The proposed minimum corporate tax on the largest companies is a sensible way for the federal government to cover these costs.

But rather than supporting this approach, as Gellert of Patagonia has done, the leaders of too many large companies have been mum on the proposed law. They have let influential business associations, such as the US Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, and Business Roundtable, lobby to defeat the corporate minimum tax.

Neil Bradley, the Chief Policy Officer at the Chamber of Commerce, argues that the new tax “would discourage investment and undermine economic growth, and [impose] price controls that would limit American innovation. Both will make our economic problems worse.” Jay Timmons, the CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers, argues that the minimum tax would “undermine manufacturers’ competitiveness at a time when the industry is reeling from supply chain disruptions and record inflation.”

Gellert is openly critical of the trade groups, writing that they are “trying to block the will of the people and our government from making meaningful progress because the organizations don’t want their members to pay their fair share of taxes.”

The trade groups’ resistance reflects a larger trend, one in which businesses are pouring unprecedented funds into lobbying efforts and exerting ever-increasing influence over our political process. According to the research group Open Secrets, in the first six months of 2022, more than $2 billion was spent on lobbying efforts overall, more than has ever spent in a comparable period. And 87% of those lobbying dollars were spent by corporations or those advancing their commercial interests.

More corporate leaders need to follow Gellert’s example and question whether their companies’ interests and values, and the well-being of our society, are best served by the trade associations they join and support. As he observes, “If you talk about how your company is going to protect the planet, you need to pay your fair share to help scale solutions for things like clean power, transportation and manufacturing.”","['Michael Posner', 'Senior Contributor']",2022-08-05 00:00:00
https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/patagonia-donates-its-entire-3-billion-estimated-worth-to-fighting-climate-change/,Patagonia Gives Away Its Entire $3 Billion Worth To Fight Climate Change,"Practicing what he preaches, Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard donates the entire $3 billion of his apparel company’s valuation to fight climate change.

As staunch an activist as you could find, Chouinard was “really pissed off” to see himself in a business news article as being valued as a billionaire, so his response was to announce that all profits in perpetuity shall go to the Patagonia Purpose Trust for helping prevent environmental disaster.

“I never wanted to be a businessman,” Chouinard wrote. “I started as a craftsman, making climbing gear for my friends and myself, then got into apparel.”

At 83, Chouinard worked with a team of lawyers alongside his family to create a model that would allow the company to continue to operate as a for-profit enterprise, but that would also act as a fundraising engine on the environment’s behalf.

2% of the family’s stock will fund an effort to ensure the company remains committed to Chouinard’s values, while the other 98% will go to projects that protect habitat and biodiversity, and fight the environmental crisis.

Patagonia has long been known as a company that does everything it can to support the environment, such as donating 1% of profits every year since 2001, amounting to $140 million, to projects that protect and restore vulnerable ecosystems, or even opening a regenerative ag-based brewery that uses a perennial grain called Kernza instead of wheat to make beer.

“While we’re doing our best to address the environmental crisis, it’s not enough,” Chouinard continued. “We needed to find a way to put more money into fighting the crisis while keeping the company’s values intact.”

Chouinard and the staff considered going public in a bid to drive investor money towards the cause, but concluded that the pressure for growth and responsibility to shareholders would have made it impossible.

Instead of going public, Patagonia explain they’re “going purpose,” by devoting their products and projects to their one and only shareholder—Earth.

Almost 50 years after its 1973 founding, billionaire Yvon Chouinard and his family will surrender all ownership of the privately held outdoor-clothing retailer, valued at about $3 billion, to two entities that will divert profits toward combating climate change and protecting undeveloped land, the rock climber–turned–executive said in a letter Wednesday.

Chouinard, his wife and two adult children have transferred their ownership to preserve the company’s independence and ensure that all of its profits — some $100 million a year — are used as they intend. Going forward, all voting stock, about 2% of the total, is now controlled by the Patagonia Purpose Trust, while the other 98% falls under what’s called the Holdfast Collective.

Chouinard told his management team and staff that he mulled other ways to increase capital and profits to eventually steer more toward environmental and resource-saving initiatives, such as a public stock offering, or an outright sale of the company. But he said those options could not guarantee the survival of Patagonia’s values. Going public was never truly an option, he said, thanks to Wall Street investors’ SPX, -0.21% ceaseless pressures to create short-term gain, sometimes at the expense of long-term responsibility. In fact, “Reimagining Capitalism” is the blurb that announces the company’s change.

The new structure is, to say the least, unusual, but there’s at least one high-profile example — Ben & Jerry’s fight with its parent company, Unilever ULVR, +0.82% — that mirrors some of the same do-good intentions, alongside the complexities in seeing those efforts survive as intended.

Still, the action sent ripples through retail and philanthropic circles.

“Yvon Chouinard will provoke every company with any sense of moral conviction to rethink their engagement with the environment,” said Fred de Gombert, CEO and co-founder of Akeneo, a product information management platform working with over 600 brands and retailers, including Carhartt, Forever 21 and Sephora. “We should all learn from this that it’s not enough to just be ‘worried’ about the environment, but that companies and the people who work in them should participate as actors in the care of the environment.”

Worrisome data adding up

The extreme weather recorded in recent years may have swayed Chouinard’s decision.

The ravages of heat, drought, flooding and more largely pinned to climate change and the burning of fossil fuels CL00, -0.67% have picked up faster and with greater intensity than earlier data indicated, a new report combining the efforts of the World Meteorological Organization and other climate-change monitoring bodies said earlier this week.

The past seven years were the warmest for Earth on record. And looking forward there is a 48% chance that during at least one year in the next five the annual mean temperature will temporarily be 1.5 degrees Celsius higher than 1850–1900 average. That’s the temperature limit set at a Paris global climate conference, and it’s the goal that guides most climate-change policy these days. But even with that target in mind, as global warming persists, breaching “tipping points” in the climate system, such as a major Arctic thaw, cannot be ruled out, the group’s findings warned.

“‘Instead of “going public,” you could say we’re “going purpose.” ‘” — Yvon Chouinard

While the report noted global pledges among countries and corporations to cut emissions does show some realization among leadership of the risks ahead, those plans may fall short, it warned.

An original ‘benefit corporation’

In the letter posted on Patagonia’s website, Chouinard detailed company efforts to date to help preserve the outdoors that his customers are drawn to. That includes products using materials that cause less harm to the environment, donating 1% of sales each year, and establishing the company as a certified B Corp and a California benefit corporation. In fact, many observers believe Patagonia is why benefit corporations exist at all. In 2018 the company’s purpose was rewritten as “We’re in business to save our home planet,” and Patagonia is famous for offering “flex time” that encourages its employees to hike and climb when they might otherwise be at work.

But Chouinard said he realized these efforts would not be enough.

“We needed to find a way to put more money into fighting the crisis while keeping the company’s values intact,” he wrote. “Truth be told, there were no good options available. So, we created our own. Instead of ‘going public,’ you could say we’re ‘going purpose.’ Earth is our only shareholder.”

Sustainability-minded observers generally cheered the significant gesture. Some, however, wondered if the action fell short of compelling the fasion and apparel industry to rethink practices.

“Although this move lays a blueprint for other owners on what they can do to support the environment, it doesn’t provide a blueprint for how the apparel industry as a whole can reduce its environmental impact,” said Raghav Sharma, co-founder of Perfitly, which creates a virtual reality/augmented reality software meant to help shoppers buy clothes that fit.

“The best way apparel companies can reduce their oversized carbon footprints is to reduce the waste associated with production, logistics and their often toxic by-products, not to mention encouraging more sustainable consumer consumption,” Sharma said.

https://truthout.org/articles/patagonias-greenwashing-ignores-workers-and-wont-solve-the-climate-crisis/,Patagonia’s Greenwashing Ignores Workers and Won’t Solve the Climate Crisis,"Among companies claiming the mantle of most responsible corporate citizen, the outdoor clothing chain Patagonia has always seemed a nose ahead. It hasn’t hurt that it’s tough imagining the ecocidal antichrist wearing a fleece vest and technical climbing pants as it pillages the earth. But Patagonia has also had the enduring myths of its founder, Yvon Chouinard, to ride on; how could we not believe the good intentions of a guy who supposedly once lived off of canned cat food just so he could read Thoreau and climb all day and night in Yosemite using gear he made himself?

Recently, Patagonia added to that mythos by outdoing itself. On September 14, the company announced that it would soon be giving away not just a certain percentage of its earnings to help protect the planet, but pretty much all of them. The entirety of the company’s stock will be transferred to trusts and nonprofits devoted to “fighting the environmental crisis and defending nature.” Corporate dividends will keep the business going while otherwise being directed toward environmental initiatives. “Compassionate capitalism” at work.

Cue neoliberal talking heads on both sides of the aisle waxing effusive about this new ceiling for market-based goodwill. To be sure, it’s an impressive relinquishment of private wealth for the supposed greater good. And among companies engaged in this type of thing, Patagonia surely is a cut above. But we do ourselves and our predicament no favors by pretending as though a capitalist enterprise giving away its profits is really going to help solve an existential problem that was caused, and continues to be worsened, by the profit motive itself.

The basics bear repeating: There is no form of capitalism — “compassionate” or otherwise, profit relinquishing or otherwise — that isn’t structurally incentivized to exploit and exhaust the capacities of both workers and the planet, and all while leaving a mess for someone else to clean up. It doesn’t matter if the product is SmartWool or smart phones: Capitalism is at heart an economy of “unpaid costs,” to quote the economist Karl William Kapp. Corporate profits — whether used to plant lilies or gild them — can only come from taking more than is given, and without replenishment or repair.

But isn’t Patagonia an exception? Isn’t it committed, as we read in painstaking detail on its website, to minimizing its expropriation of nature through all manner of recycled and “sustainably sourced materials”? In degree, maybe not. In kind, definitely not. Even the most ethically minded for-profit companies participate in an economy of market share and competition that, directly or indirectly, encourages this race to the exploitative bottom. Regardless of what Patagonia is doing with its profits, it still has to remain competitive in order to make them. And that, as capitalism requires, means continuing to bleed land and labor dry.

It’s also important to remember that Patagonia isn’t exactly small. The company has over 70 stores, keeps offices in seven countries, and at one time had contracts with 100 factories, all in support of one of the most polluting industries on the planet. The fact that it bends over backwards to excuse itself, for instance, in a 30-paragraph statement explaining how it’s trying — really trying! — to minimize the impact of microplastics pollution, changes nothing. It’s all talk after a point. Whatever Patagonia’s efforts are toward sustainability, they pale in comparison to the impact it makes on land and labor due to its size.

It should be no surprise that, despite the implicit mea culpa of its recent divestment, the company tries to downplay all of this. Seemingly everywhere on its website, it mitigates the sense of its corporate largess by using the classic leveling device of capitalist greenwashing: the carbon footprint — a concept invented by oil giant BP nearly 20 years ago precisely to deflect attention away from the disproportionately large ecological responsibilities held by corporations. But the carbon footprint device also allows Patagonia to frame its ecological responsibilities in relation to individual consumers as though those responsibilities existed on the same plane — as though the solution required of the company was merely reducing rather than changing its structural relationship to what was being reduced. Yet the sentimental “all in this together” manipulation runs thick: “If we have any hope of a thriving planet — much less a business,” they write, “it is going to take all of us doing what we can.”

Whatever Patagonia’s efforts are toward sustainability, they pale in comparison to the impact it makes on land and labor due to its size.

Then there’s the company’s use of the classic and equally manipulative Malthusian rhetoric of planetary limits: “Despite its immensity,” the company’s hands wring, “the Earth’s resources are not infinite, and it’s clear we’ve exceeded its limits.” The implication, both here and with the carbon footprint concept, is once again that we’re all equally culpable. Yet limits like these are political constructs, and those who invoke them in this way do so to conceal their inequitable contributions toward reaching them. There is no real “we” here, in other words. There are profit-driven corporations whose productive forces unleash immense creative-destructive power, and then there is the rest of us. The excessive consumption of millionaires and billionaires aside, if a limit has been exceeded anywhere, it is overwhelmingly because of corporations.

But the company’s most frustrating greenwashing is maybe its most subtle. In a statement on the recent decision, Patagonia writes that “instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth.” Notice the sneaky substitution: The company is no longer “extracting value from nature” but simply “using the wealth Patagonia creates.” It’s a classic mystification concealing the fact that you can’t have one (corporate wealth) without the other (extracting value from nature). Using profits generated via capitalism to protect the planet will always be a matter of robbing Peter to pay Paul.

And quite literally. Because human beings are, of course, the other form of nature that capitalism — Patagonia included — exploits for value. In yet another long statement on its website, this one recounting its decades-long attempts to ensure more ethical labor practices, we learn about the company’s relationship with the Fair Labor Association, NAFTA’s role in tanking the American textile industry, and other matters. But by paragraph 16 in this substantial read, things still haven’t progressed very far: “The next big task,” the company writes after all of that, “will be to secure a living wage for all workers making Patagonia goods.”

A living wage. The next big task. In paragraph 16. As if this shouldn’t have been in the first sentence.

There is nothing about a living wage for Patagonia’s workers in the company’s recent bleeding-heart statement about its decision to give away its profit.

There is nothing about a living wage for Patagonia’s workers, of course, in the company’s recent bleeding-heart statement about its decision to give away its profits. We read about the planet multiple times, but not so much about people. Lest critics insist that one always implies the other, we should consider the fact that what the company sells in its stores is in part an ideology that insists otherwise. Patagonia is in many ways a technology company: It sells clothing that mediates our relationship with nature, allowing us to experience it more easily as something benign and conquered that exists for human consumption, not as something with which human survival is inextricably bound. This privileged, bourgeois conception of nature — nature as something “out there” to explore and enjoy, separate from human well-being — is bought for the price of a Patagonia sweater; it’s a class-inflected framework that insulates more privileged people — both literally and figuratively — from experiencing nature as involving and implicating human suffering.

But compare this, for instance, with how Patagonia’s garment workers in the Global South might experience nature. If they’re being deprived of a living wage, they are markedly more vulnerable to floods and fires, heat waves and droughts, all worsened by climate change. Nature for them isn’t so much pretty vistas to enjoy and consume as something that could further immiserate or kill them. That makes low wages every bit as much a cause of climate disasters as pollution from plastic plants pumping out raw materials for performance socks. And yet those wages probably won’t be going up much any time soon. After all, they’re a precondition of the fat dividends that will supposedly now be going to such great, green things. Greenwashing, built as always on the backs of the poor.

With its recent news, which will no doubt be a huge boost to sales, Patagonia is banking on all of us forgetting this. It is hoping that the ideology of nature it sells, underwritten by capitalism’s own incentives to hide its conditions of production, will prevail, and that the only thing its customers will think about when buying a new base layer is the wilderness they’ll possibly be saving, not the workers who will continue to be exploited just so the sham ethics of green capitalism can have another day in the sun.

We must resist this. How? Not by refusing to shop at Patagonia. That kind of consumer politics accomplishes nothing. Instead, we must remember in our movements, in our policy, and in the voting booth that it is capitalism’s mandate of endless accumulation that is killing our ecosystem, not what is or isn’t done with the resulting profits.

https://www.newhope.com/news/patagonia-provisions-announces-acquisition-moonshot,Patagonia Provisions announces acquisition of Moonshot,"Patagonia Provisions, the food and beverage division of Patagonia, announced Tuesday that it has acquired Moonshot, a Planet Forward Inc. snack brand known for its climate-friendly practices.

“I founded Moonshot with the vision of using the power of food to help tackle climate change,” said Julia Collins, founder of Moonshot. “By joining Patagonia Provisions, who recently made Earth their only shareholder, Moonshot now belongs to the planet. I cannot imagine a more spectacular path forward for our mission, our team and our Climatarian community.”

The company also produces the crackers using renewable energy in a LEED-certified facility, and makes its boxes with 100% recycled materials and are, themselves, recyclable, Collins told New Hope in 2022.

""To us, it's not one action, but taking a full inventory of your company's impact on the planet so you can holistically evaluate where you can make adjustments and drive change. It all starts with measuring your baseline carbon footprint so you can create an action plan from there and track progress year over year,"" she said in that interview.

For its climate mission and taste, Moonshot won the Expo West Virtual 2021 NEXTY Award for Best New Savory or Salty Snack.

This acquisition—Patagonia's first in more than 20 years—is part of an effort to invest in businesses and products that support the company's mission to save the planet.

As consumers become increasingly aware of the role the food system plays in the climate crisis, many are seeking foods with an improved environmental impact. Patagonia Provisions is meeting this rising consumer demand for climate-friendly foods by sourcing ingredients that rebuild soil, protect the health of ocean ecosystems and otherwise protect the environment.

“Moonshot has achieved impressive growth by producing and selling delicious and nutritious crackers with a materially improved carbon footprint compared to industry standard practices,” said Paul Lightfoot, general manager of Patagonia Provisions. “Moonshot’s values and mission are strongly aligned with Patagonia Provisions, which made it easy to warmly welcome their people onto our team.”

Rachel Stoczko/Moonshot Snacks

Moonshot was created to be the first climate-friendly snack brand with the mission of tackling the climate crisis through the power of responsible food supply chains. Moonshot’s main ingredient, wheat, is grown with regenerative and organic practices and is traceable to the farm and field. Furthering the mission, Moonshot designed a micro supply chain, with its wheat farmers, miller and manufacturer within 100 miles of each other, resulting in a lower carbon footprint.

Patagonia Provisions was one of the first companies to partner with the Rodale Institute in support of Regenerative Organic Certification. The parent company, Patagonia, stopped providing branded clothing for companies that damaged the environment; it takes back used Patagonia apparel for recycling or reuse—and uses scraps to recreate other products in its ReCrafted Collection.

Perhaps most notably, Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard and his family in September transferred their ownership of the company to the Holdfast Collective, a nonprofit dedicated to preserving the planet.

""Instead of 'going public,' you could say we’re 'going purpose.' Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth,"" Chouinard wrote on the company’s website.

https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/15/yvon-chouinard-the-existential-dirtbag-who-founded-and-gifted-patagonia,Yvon Chouinard – the ‘existential dirtbag’ who founded and gifted Patagonia,"The publication of a magazine article in 2017 “really, really pissed off” Yvon Chouinard, the mountain climber turned reluctant businessman and founder of outdoor clothing company Patagonia.

In the article, Forbes crowned Chouinard as a billionaire and added him to its list of the world’s richest people. While many people daydream of achieving a nine-zero fortune, for Chouinard it was a sign he had failed in his life’s mission to make the world a better and fairer place.

The Forbes article set him on a journey to find a way of giving away Patagonia, the company he founded almost 50 years ago with a mission to help fellow climbers. This week he achieved that aim, announcing that he was giving away all of the shares in Patagonia to a trust that will use future profits to “help fight” the climate crisis.

“Earth is now our only shareholder,” Chouinard, 83, said in a message to staff and customers. “Instead of ‘going public’, you could say we’re ‘going purpose’. Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth.”

Explaining his decision to give away the company, Chouinard told the New York Times: “I was in Forbes magazine listed as a billionaire, which really, really pissed me off. I don’t have $1bn in the bank. I don’t drive Lexuses.”

Chouinard, who drives a beaten-up Subaru with a surfboard strapped to the roof, says he hopes giving away the company “will influence a new form of capitalism that doesn’t end up with a few rich people and a bunch of poor people”.

He is a businessperson, but very much by accident, and finds the descriptor offensive. He once told a journalist from Outside Magazine during a multi-day climbing trip up Mount Arrowhead, in Wyoming, that he would prefer to be referred to as a “dirtbag”.

Challenged by the reporter, who argued that you can’t be a multimillionaire and a dirtbag, Chouinard said he gave away all of this money and he doesn’t “even have a savings account”.

“But that’s not even the point,” Chouinard continued. “Being a dirtbag is a matter of philosophy, not personal wealth. I’m an existential dirtbag.”

Refusing to let it go, the reporter tried again saying Chouinard was a “very successful businessman” and “somewhere along the way you must have wanted to be a businessman”. Chouinard exploded back: “Never! All I ever wanted to be was a craftsman.”

And that is how he started. In 1957 he bought a second-hand coal-fired forge and set up a blacksmith shop in a chicken coop in his parents’ back yard in Burbank, California. He hand-made pitons – metal pegs or spikes driven into a rocks to support climbers’ ropes.

The pitons proved very popular with his friends and other climbers. It was also profitable as he could forge two pitons an hour and sell them for $1.50 each (the equivalent of about $16 today), giving Chouinard time and money to spend adventuring.

“I’d often climb for half a day at Stoney Point in Chatsworth, then go up to Rincon [to surf] the evening glass, [and] after I’d free-dive for lobsters and abalone on the coast between Zuma and the county line,” he wrote in his memoir Some Stories: Lessons from the Edge of Business and Sport. “I almost always got my limit of 10 lobsters and five abalone.”

Soon he figured out that he could pack up his blacksmith tools and take them with him as he surfed his way up and down the west of the US during the winter, and on climbing trips across the US and Canada in the summer. One year he spent weeks in the Rockies surviving on a case of 5¢ cans of tuna cat food mixed with oatmeal, potatoes, “ground squirrel, blue grouse, and porcupines assassinated à la Trotsky, with an ice axe”.

Some years he spent more than 200 nights sleeping outside, and claims not to have owned a tent until he was almost 40. In 1962 he was arrested for riding a freight train in Arizona and spent 18 days in jail on a charge of “wandering around aimlessly with no apparent means of support”.

The idea of setting up a clothing business came about on a climbing trip. In Scotland in the winter of 1970, he bought a rugby shirt to wear while rock climbing as the thick collar kept his hardware slings, loaded with heavy equipment, from cutting into his neck. He kept wearing the top – which was azure blue with two red and one yellow stripes – when back in the US, and his climbing friends asked where they could get one.

He found out and started importing them, before expanding into other clothing and equipment for climbing. The company was originally called Chouinard Equipment, before he changed it after a transformative trip to Patagonia, in southern South America, to climb Mount Fitz Roy with his best friend, Doug Tompkins, the founder of rival outdoors company the North Face.

In another memoir, Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman, Chouinard wrote that if he “had to be a businessman” he was “going to do it on my own terms”.

“Work had to be enjoyable on a daily basis. We all had to come to work on the balls of our feet and go up the stairs two steps at a time. We needed to be surrounded by friends who could dress whatever way they wanted, even be barefoot,” he wrote.

Decades before the pandemic, flexible working was always the standard at Patagonia, which is headquartered in Ventura, California, because it is one of the world’s best surfing spots.

“We don’t care when you work, as long as the work gets done,” he said in a speech at the University of California, Los Angeles. “If you’re a serious surfer, you don’t go, ‘Hey let’s go surfing next Thursday at 2pm’ – that’s what losers say.”

“You go surfing when there’s surf, you go powder skiing when there’s powder. We wanted to have a job where we would be allowed to do that. And we wanted to go work with friends – we didn’t want to work with MBAs.

“We wanted to break the rules of business.”",['Rupert Neate'],2022-09-15 00:00:00

Joaquín Temes

There are no accidents in Argentina when it comes to the timing of judicial decisions and information leaks, especially when they carry the strong scent of the intelligence agencies. The release of a series of incriminating private chat messages between federal magistrates, City officials, and top executives from Grupo Clarín came just as a court in the capital was preparing its guilty verdict for Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, which effectively came a few weeks ago but had been written for some time. It sets the table for both sides of the deeply divided political field to accuse each other of being the incarnation of evil, on the one hand responding to “lawfare” and the international conspiracy against progressive leaders, and on the other of abusing their control of the intelligence agencies for illicit espionage. In both cases, it demonstrates that Argentina’s leading political sectors – essentially defined by their position for or against Kirchnerism and Peronism more generally – represent two sides of the same old and rusty coin, and are therefore in great part responsible for today’s constant state of crisis. The media, organized roughly in the same way as the politicians, is on the same boat.

Most in the country were only just beginning to come down from the adrenaline rollercoaster that was the World Cup match against Australia at the time, in which the Albiceleste’s clear superiority wasn’t capitalized in terms of goals, meaning the last few minutes of the match turned into a nail-biting experience. Around that time (it was a Saturday) a series of private chats between a group of characters involving the likes of federal judge Julian Ercolini, Buenos Aires City Security Minister Marcelo D’Alessandro, and two members of the Mahíques clan (both of them powerful judges) began to circulate among journalists. Judges Pablo Yadarola and Pablo Cayssials, former intelligence agent Leonardo Bergot, media executive Tomas Reinke, and Grupo Clarín executives Jorge Rendo and Pablo Casey, completed the list of participants. The messages, which included voice notes, were taken from two separate groups on the private communications application Telegram.

The select group had spent a few days at a beautiful estancia near the Patagonian city of Bariloche named Lago Escondido. The vast majority of the land near the lake is owned by British magnate Joe Lewis, a known friend of former president Mauricio Macri. The group had flown in on a private plane and were invited by Clarín to the retreat. The content of the chats expose several of them in their intimacy, with foul language and other unsavory phrases come to light. But they also crucially show how these magistrates and officials sought to cover their steps by creating fake invoices, trying to impose a false narrative by either manipulating friendly journalists or blocking coverage of the trip altogether. They also make thinly veiled threats against those they deem responsible for the leaks.

The story of the flight had initially been covered in mid-October by Página/12, a publication clearly aligned with the ruling Frente de Todos coalition. After the initial appearance of the leaked messages, only Perfil, Tiempo Argentino, and Horacio Verbitsky’s website El Cohete a la Luna decided to publish them (the latter two are in the same ideological space as Página).

The incriminating private messages were acquired through some sort of hacking of D’Alessandro’s phone. According to Verbitsky, they were available for sale on a digital marketplace for leaks for $600 to be paid in cryptocurrency. Telegram, which is supposedly safer than other messaging applications like WhatsApp, is known to be vulnerable to several schemes, some of which are relatively simple to execute if a desktop user session is open, as journalist Pablo Corso explained recently on the Modo Fontevecchia show. He mentions the use of “SIM swapping” (or requesting a new SIM card from the mobile phone provider without the knowledge of the account holder). There’s also the possibility that a much more sophisticated agent could use software like Pegasus, which last year was shown by a journalistic investigation to have been used to hack politicians and government officials, journalists, human rights activists, business executives and others, though these systems are hugely expensive.

These messages have opened many lines of questions and analysis. There is nothing inherently criminal in having these magistrates and officials accept an invitation to a public retreat from an interest group that happens to be the country’s largest media conglomerate. The issue here is ethical, rather, given the massive potential for a conflict of interest that requires someone like Ercolini, Mahíques, or D’Alessandro to live by the maxim “ser y parecer” (which roughly translates to “being and appearing to be”). For a group of magistrates and public officials that have been involved in sensitive cases regarding Kirchnerite figures, and who have been accused of carrying out a campaign “lawfare,” accepting a free trip to Joe Lewis’ mansion paid by Clarín is the epitome of naiveté. Trying to cover it up using fake invoices constitutes a crime. And leaving all of this in writing in two Telegram groups is pure stupidity.

Which leads us to another can of worms: these messages were clearly acquired by a malicious actor engaging in illicit espionage. Not only does that speak badly of the participants, who are people connected to the intelligence and security sectors (they should’ve known better!), but also of the political actors trying to benefit from their publication, namely President Alberto Fernández and the now-convicted Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. It’s interesting to note that the head of state and his second-in-command have spent a lot of words criticizing the Macri administration for their spurious use and abuse of the intelligence agencies over the past three years, only to jump on this conveniently timed leak of illicitly acquired private communications. It’s also contradictory in that Fernández de Kirchner and her husband enjoyed the services of both spies and judges during their golden years, clearing them of wrongdoing and pressuring opponents at their disposal. Selective justice and the political use of the Judiciary is one of the major systemic problems of the Argentine democratic system, and it isn’t just a Kirchnerista or Macrista problem – it stretches at least all the way back to the Carlos Menem administration.

The role of the media should also be scrutinized critically in the wake of this leak. The editorial directors of both Clarín and La Nación penned articles accusing the president of legitimizing illicit espionage while indicating the private nature of the messages should have been respected by non-militant newsrooms. In the messages, the participants are seen scheming how best to manipulate the public opinion, mentioning several of Argentina’s major outlets and journalists, including some aligned with Frente de Todos. As usual, the issue has become politicized, with coverage responding to the outlet’s ideological position. Clarín, La Nación and Infobae didn’t publish anything until they had no choice, while the “militant media” responding to Kirchnerism and Peronism more broadly went at it, many times without even checking the information. At Perfil — which was accused by Rendo in the leaked messages of being “oficialistas” or aligned with the government – we checked the information with the group participants and sought to only publish leaked information that we deemed of public interest. What was written in those chats was serious enough to merit publication despite a breach of the personal privacy of these public officials and members of the private sector, but at the same time we tried to emphasise that there was nothing illegal about the original trip, only what came after, even if the trip itself was ethically questionable. And we shouldn’t be oblivious to the fact that it was timed to come out just before Cristina’s conviction.

https://mynorthwest.com/3644172/ross-patagonia-sale-truly-good-thing-or-shameless-lobbying-loophole/,Ross: Is Patagonia’s sale to a non-profit shameless exploitation of a tax loophole?,"Recently, the owner of Patagonia – the makers of those super-comfortable $35 boxer briefs – announced he would donate the whole company to a new non-profit organization that he set up. And this organization will collect and spend the company’s profits – on “social welfare.”

That arrangement makes the transaction tax-free. No capital gains on the appreciated value of the company; no gift tax on the donations to the non-profit.

More from Dave Ross: Months after his SCOTUS decision on prayer in schools, where is coach Joe Kennedy?

Sounded pretty noble – until Axios covered the story under the headline: “The Ultimate Billionaire Tax Dodge”

Which suddenly made it sound a little sleazy.

Axios reported that Patagonia was the second company in the past year to do this – the other being Tripp Lite, which makes electrical devices, and was also donated to a non-profit set up by its owner, a transaction that was also tax-free.

This is all completely legal under the IRS rules which grant tax exemptions to “Social Welfare Organizations.”

The question is whether this is truly a good thing or a shameless loophole.

Well, according to the IRS, these non-profit social welfare organizations must, “further the common good and general welfare of the people of the community.”

And to achieve those goals, they are allowed to lobby congress. Ah! There’s the loophole!

Axios clearly suspects that these new social welfare organizations are going to be knee-deep in lobbying. Patagonia on the left, and Tripp Lite on the right.

But I say we give them a chance!

Because it could be a great demonstration of the ingenuity of the private sector.

With the number of billionaires we’ve spawned, I can see social welfare organizations solving so many social problems that government welfare programs– and the bureaucracy that goes with them – would no longer be necessary.

Housing for the homeless would appear on privately-purchased land donated by Patagonia. Drug treatment centers would sprout up courtesy of Tripp Lite.

These profit-funded non-profits could remove graffiti, powerwash the sidewalks, build sterilized and supervised public bathrooms – and we would reward them by purchasing their products, and posting hearts on Twitter.

And yes, if these organizations promote something you hate, you should be free to boycott their products.

Especially if they choose to spend their social welfare budgets on political lobbying because that’s just using their untaxed wealth to shell each other while the problems go unsolved.

Instead of trying to manipulate politicians – who’ve proven they can’t agree – why not go around them and solve these problems yourselves!

Pay for daily graffiti removal. Build permanently-affordable housing on private land. Provide detox on demand. I would post so many Twitter hearts! But if you’re in it just for the fight – I’m not buying your stuff anymore. No matter how comfortable your briefs are.

Mr. Chouinard and his family have transferred their ownership of Patagonia to a trust and a nonprofit organization as opposed to taking the privately held company public or selling it, the 83-year-old founder said in a letter Wednesday, titled “Earth is now our only shareholder.”","['Joseph De Avila', 'Joseph Pisani']",
https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryjosephs/2022/09/26/just-two-cheers-for-patagonias-chouinard-why-ignore-an-esop/,Just Two Cheers For Patagonia’s Chouinard: Why Ignore An ESOP?,"As a business advisor and outdoors enthusiast, I’ve long admired Yvon Chouinard. Protecting nature is one of four core values of Patagonia, the global outdoor apparel and equipment company he founded a half-century ago. Chouinard is also committed to the welfare of his employees, and Fortune even named it the “coolest company on the planet.”

So, I read with intense interest Chouinard’s bold decision to transfer his family’s ownership of the gear maker, valued at $3 billion, to an environmental nonprofit and place its voting stock into a trust. “Earth is now our only shareholder” headlined Patagonia’s news release.

I applaud the way Chouinard and his family have structured the sale to continue Patagonia’s environmental focus. They have transferred all of their voting stock – about 2% of overall shares – into the Patagonia Purpose Trust. It will be overseen by family members and their closest advisors to ensure the company honors its pledge to run a socially responsible business and gives away its profits to a newly established nonprofit, Holdfast Collective, that will own the nonvoting common shares and use the profits on climate initiatives.

An ESOP protects your legacy, ensuring that you can not only remain independent, but also maintain ... [+] your focus on being a great place to work, a valued member of our community, and a good steward of the environment. getty

At the same time, is it a missed opportunity? Over the last 20 years, I have counseled hundreds of private and family-owned companies about the benefits of employee ownership, or ESOP, as part of a change-of-ownership. So, I wonder why Chouinard and his advisors didn’t at the least consider a partial ESOP structure – a plan that gives, say, 20% to 30% ownership in Patagonia to his 2,000-plus loyal and devoted employees.

The omission is baffling, especially since strong employee morale and engagement have been synonymous with Patagonia, and an ESOP could drive retirement security for employees in perpetuity. Chouinard has demonstrated repeatedly that he cares about his employees. The Ventura, Calif., company was the first for-profit California business to become a B Corp company that is measured by its social and environmental performance. Its headquarters has no enclosed workspaces, and Chouinard doesn’t have an office. It was among the first companies to establish an on-site childcare center.

Plus, his philosophical employee manual (which became the 2005 book Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman) essentially urges employees to cut work to ride the waves when the surf’s up. President Obama even recognized the company as a “Champion of Change” for its commitment to working families.

To be sure, Chouinard has addressed employee stock options and employee ownership in the past – and rejected them. In another book he published in 2012, The Responsible Company, he disclosed his apprehensions about employee and public ownership.

He voiced concerns that, “with shares more broadly distributed, the company would become overly cautious about undertaking risks in the pursuit of its environmental goals.” He added he was “willing to undertake risks that might give pause to broader ownership, even of employees committed to reducing environmental impact.”

Moreover, I would be churlish if I didn’t acknowledge Chouinard and his family’s generosity. The transaction’s structure, in which the family is gifting its non-voting Patagonia common shares to the Holdfast Collective, means the family will receive no tax benefit for its donation. That’s because Holdfast is a 501(c)(4), able to make unlimited political contributions, rendering donations to it non-tax deductible.

So, why did Chouinard neglect to create an ESOP, which could have been achieved at no additional cost to himself? To be honest, as is still often the case today, it may be because Chouinard or his advisors have not fully grasped the distinct tax, financial and other advantages that a partial or full ESOP can deliver to future growth and success of a company, including a Certified B Corp.

ESOPs and B Corps share many similar core values. No wonder an article in ESOP Builders, a Canadian consultancy, headlined “B Corps and ESOPs – Best of Both Worlds.” Dansko, the Pennsylvania-based comfort footwear maker, is a Certified B Corp that became a 100% ESOP-owned company in 2012. Its co-founder and CEO Mandy Cabot says becoming an employee-owned B Corp “protects our legacy, ensuring that we can not only remain independent, but also maintain our focus on being a great place to work, a valued member of our community, and a good steward of the environment.”

So, here's my message to Chouinard and his board of directors. If the donation of the other 98% of Patagonia’s common shares to the Holdfast Collective has not yet closed, it is not too late to establish a partial ESOP, like Clif Bar did, and drive legacy value for the employees of this great company.

Having continued to observe many of the private companies I assisted in going the ESOP route, I can say without pause that they, their employees, and their communities benefit. A 2019 ESOP Association survey of members backs me up. Eighty-five percent reported their ESOP had a positive impact on their corporate culture and 75% said employees were more involved in ensuring the company’s financial success. Perhaps that explains why 72% of respondents to a separate survey would prefer to work for an employee-owned company.

Mr. Chouinard, have your advisors give me a call.","['Mary Josephs', 'Amy Danise']",2022-09-26 00:00:00
https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/puma-population-patagonia-booming-now-what,The Puma Population in Patagonia Is Booming. Now What?,"The puma family was dining just inches off a paved road to southern Chile’s Torres del Paine National Park. It was a scene straight from a wildlife documentary: Alongside her young cubs, an adult female named Petaca gnawed on the carcass of a guanaco, a member of the camelid family that’s the Patagonian puma’s prey of choice. Less picturesque were the vehicles zooming past, or pulling over to join the growing crowd of people watching and photographing the pumas. Temporarily sated from their meal, Petaca’s cubs wandered, perilously, onto the road.

Those young cats summed up the joys and perils of being a puma in this part of Patagonia right now, where the puma population in and around Torres del Paine has been rebounding for at least a decade. Precise numbers are scarce—the first comprehensive scientific puma survey in many years is currently being interpreted by Panthera, a global wild cat conservation organization—but everyone I talked to, including locals, guides, and national park officials, reported seeing more pumas now than they used to.

One puma tracker told me she saw maybe a single puma per year before 2012. Over the course of a few weeks of reporting in and around Torres del Paine in March and April, I spotted 22 cats.

Conservationists attribute the rebound to a healthy population of guanaco, along with a reduction in puma hunting. When the pandemic came along, it offered the cats an unexpected boost; COVID-19 shut down tourism and closed the park for more than eight months, giving the cats and their prey even more room to flourish.

But it’s not just the number of pumas that has made puma sightings so much more common in and around this park. Torres del Paine is the second most-visited park in Chile, routinely attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors per year before the pandemic (more than 304,000 tourists came in 2019). Over time, many pumas around Torres del Paine have become habituated to humans and their vehicles. Now that the park has reopened to tourism, more pumas are being seen by more humans here than ever before.

Such puma-human encounters can be dangerous for both species. “People in the park see pumas acting like house cats,” adds Nicolas Lagos, a puma program conservation scientist at Panthera. “But that’s a predator that can kill you.” Guests at one local luxury lodge found a puma on their patio. Some guides at another lodge no longer jog alone between the guest area and staff housing for fear of triggering a puma’s natural chase instinct. Most striking, a child visitor in Torres del Paine was stalked by a puma on the Aonikenk Trail, an easy-going path that leads to culturally significant cave paintings. “Fortunately, the situation did not end in misfortune, but it was very close,” remembers Gonzalo Cisternas Lopez, ranger technical coordinator for Torres del Paine National Park, where he’s worked since 2000.

Puma attacks on humans are rare worldwide, and most encounters aren’t fatal. But after the stalking incident, Cisternas noted, the park added a requirement that hikers on the Aonikenk Trail be accompanied by a guide. And, film crews must now have pepper spray on hand when filming inside the park. Many guides and conservationists I spoke to fear that park traffic will eventually kill a puma on the road. But the most acute threat to these pumas might be sheep; or, rather, the humans who earn a living protecting those sheep.

This region of southern Chile is home to enormous sheep ranches, called estancias, where pumas have been killed as a threat to livestock for centuries. The park itself is a vast patchwork of former estancias and is surrounded by working sheep ranches. The greatest danger is for adult pumas seeking their own territories, because they sometimes move out of places where the big cats are protected and onto working estancias whose gauchos shoot pumas on sight.

“Some ranchers refer to human-habituated park pumas as ‘stupid pumas’ because they’re so easy to kill,” says puma tracker Miguel Fuentealba. Chilean law prohibits killing pumas, and the law is enforced inside the national park, but according to Lagos, “outside the park no one enforces that.” In his 2022 book, On the Edge: Puma, Torres del Paine, Lagos reports that a skilled puma hunter—called a leonero—working on a sheep ranch may kill 75 to 100 pumas a year, earning $200 to $400 per kill. “Humans are the only puma predator here,” he says.

As pumas become more plentiful and habituated to humans, puma hunting on estancias around the national park will become an even more significant threat. In recent years, however, a few of the park’s neighboring ranchers have adopted puma-friendly measures on vast tracts of land, thus expanding puma protection well beyond park boundaries.

Pia Vergara, creator and executive director of the not-for-profit Cerro Guido Conservation Foundation (where Lagos serves as a conservation advisor), is dedicated to finding ways for ranchers, sheep, and pumas to coexist. But it’s slow work getting gauchos to break centuries-old habits. So far, Vergara has convinced just two of the gauchos that work on Estancia Cerro Guido to go into the field with her to experience pumas in a different way.

“I would like to spend all of my time in the mountains, but I have to be the mediator between pumas and people,” says Lagos, who describes the work of the Cerro Guido Conservation Foundation as a combination of conservation and sociology. Ultimately, profit drives the puma killing in this region; ranchers estimate that every sheep killed is a loss of US$100.

With that in mind, the Cerro Guido Conservation Foundation is experimenting with unconventional methods of preserving profits without killing pumas. Today, 20 Great Pyrenees and Maremma dogs (breeds used in Europe to fend off wolf attacks) bark and scent mark to deter puma predation of the 18,000 sheep on Estancia Cerro Guido’s 250,000 acres. Mobile lighting is also being tested on the estancia. Numbers from 2020, the first year that these systems were in place, show puma predation of sheep on Estancia Cerro Guido hovered around 1 percent of the total number of animals on the land—a meaningful reduction in losses from the average puma predation rate of 7 to 10 percent.

The owners of Estancia Laguna Amarga adopted a different approach. After large numbers of their sheep perished in a snow and wind storm followed by a fire on their 17,000-acre third-generation family ranch, sisters Dania and Daneska Goic pivoted to tourism. They did not replace the sheep and, in 2015, identified 70 individual pumas on their estancia, which abuts the national park. In 2017, the former sheep ranch began offering guided puma-spotting tours. Laguna Amarga’s bottom line now also benefits from the production companies that want to shoot wildlife documentaries on the estancia. During a recent BBC shoot on Estancia Laguna Amarga, for the Dynasties series hosted by David Attenborough, crew members were astonished by the density and approachability of the pumas.

“I never thought this place would be so famous,” Dania says, adding that she and Daneska faced skepticism and open derision from owners of neighboring estancias when they began puma tourism, which makes their current success even sweeter. In 2022, the nearby Estancia Cerro Guido, which has a boutique hotel and restaurant, also began puma tourism, offering guests the chance to check camera traps and learn about pumas with specialist guides. Puma tourism is booming, from photography-focused tours to Quasar Expeditions’ multiday puma safari with a puma tracker and puma guide.

But as puma tourism options increase, the sector remains totally unregulated. The national park requires guides working within park boundaries to be highly trained and officially certified. Outside the park, anyone can call themselves a puma guide or a puma tracker (although some are certified national park guides). The closest thing to a puma tourism governing body are the social media groups used by those working in puma tourism, and an informal annual meeting during which the 20 to 40 people now working as puma trackers and puma guides talk about problems and best practices.

And even as puma tourism encourages change on some estancias, the potential for profit remains unevenly distributed. Estancias far from the park and its tourist revenues have little financial reason to evolve. Some insiders have suggested that puma tourism estancias near the park could share profits with more remote ranches, if they agree to forego killing the cats.

Until then, the vast majority of estancias in the Torres del Paine area are still doing things the old-fashioned way—relying on armed gauchos who view the pumas as nothing more than a costly threat to livestock. But Lagos is hopeful that coexistence measures and farm-based puma tourism are steps in the right direction. “People are proud of gaucho culture, and rightly so,” he says, “but pumas could inspire pride too.”",[],
https://gearjunkie.com/apparel/patagonia-nano-puff-jacket-review,Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket Review: The Classic Still Stands Out,"A time-tested favorite in the outdoor community, the Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket may be the most well-known synthetic layer on the market.

Bumping through the African highlands in the back of a dusty Land Rover, summiting a rain-soaked Appalachian peak, sipping coffee with friends in a hipster downtown shop — these are just a few of the memories that play through my mind when I slide my weathered Nano Puff out of the closet.

As one of the first puffies I ever wore and the first semi-expensive gift I bought my dad for Christmas when I left the house for college, the Nano Puff holds a strong nostalgia factor for me. It’s pretty cool that an inanimate piece of fabric can store up so much intrinsic value, which I guess is where the Nano Puff truly shines.

While it’s not the highest performer in every category, it has a heritage as one of the first jackets to offer premium synthetic insulation with a lightweight but durable design, and has been a favorite with outdoor enthusiasts for just about forever.

This mega classic jacket excels in several categories: It’s super comfortable, layers well, has a simple but functional design, and delivers surprising warmth for how thin it feels. It’s built a reputation for being a stylish jacket for use around town while consistently performing well in the mountains, and it’s considered one of the most solid crossover pieces on the market.

Though it’s not the most breathable (or the warmest) jacket out there, it stands out as more of a general workhorse.

In short: If you are looking for premium breathability, weather resistance, or a higher warmth factor, there are better options (even by Patagonia) that are dedicated to those activities. However, as a do-it-all, reliable addition to your layering system, the Nano Puff ($229) remains a top pick for mountain athletes or casual weekend warriors that need a solid jacket for a broad range of activities and climates.

Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket Review

Testing the Nano Puff

The Nano Puff has been around for a long time, but as fresh competition enters the market, I wanted to see if the newest edition of this crowd favorite still lived up to the hype. I wore this model in a variety of different settings, from long backpacking trips and multipitch climbs, to casual strolls around town in colder weather. I tested its breathability, warmth, weather resistance, durability, and compressibility. It’s still definitely a worthy jacket.

It boasts a competitive warmth-to-weight ratio, stuffs down small, and was one of my top picks for all-day wear from a coffee shop downtown to sending hard at the crag.

Breathability

I would say the Nano Puff delivers average breathability compared to other models in its weight category. This isn’t the area it shines the most, but it’s notably more ventilated than other jackets that are dedicated to retaining as much warmth as possible.

The top-of-the-line 60g PrimaLoft Gold Eco insulation does a great job of holding in body heat given how thin it is, but unfortunately it doesn’t let much air in or out, meaning sweat builds up pretty fast once active. The smooth lining of the jacket is a nice addition for next-to-skin comfort but becomes quite clammy when sweat begins to build up. I wouldn’t recommend this for intense active use.

This also contributes to its lack of breathability, as the solid sheet lining means the exterior stitching does not continue to the interior, creating another barrier to ventilation. While this limits airflow, it does make the jacket more wind-resistant, a definite plus in colder temps.

The insulation is held in place with quilted squares, and the stitching between these squares does let more air through than other models (like the Patagonia Micro Puff), but not enough to be considered an active insulation jacket. I also found that the stitching seemed to unravel quicker than expected in some spots, and there are quite a few dangling strands after a few months of use.

Because there are so many squares, thorns and branches catch on the jacket easily during off-trail use, without traveling smoothly over the ripstop fabric.

Warmth

Again, this isn’t the warmest jacket on the market, but it still holds its own compared to other models of similar weight. It’s a solid option for shoulder season adventures, or as a part of your layering system for colder winter missions.

The current model uses PrimaLoft Gold Eco insulation, a top-shelf synthetic material that delivers impressive warmth for its weight, retains its insulating properties well when wet and is produced with a mind to reduce carbon emissions. Its high compressibility makes the warmth it does deliver much more impressive. I was consistently surprised at how comfortable I stayed in colder weather.

The drawcord-adjustable hem does a pretty good job of sealing in warmth and keeping out drafts. Although I did find the elastic around the cuffs to fit me a bit loosely, letting some cold in along my arms.

That said, I would still consider this a three-season jacket, as it can serve as a dedicated outer layer or be paired with other pieces when temps approach freezing. The slick internal and external fabric makes it super easy to layer the Nano Puff with an outer shell, or an extra midlayer underneath.

Water Resistance

The DWR finish on the Nano Puff’s shell causes light precipitation to bead up well and roll off before soaking into the fabric, but the jacket quickly absorbs water once it really starts to rain. There is also a significant amount of stitching, which allows moisture to seep into the insulation faster than other jackets with larger quilt patterns.

While the insulation will keep you warm even after the jacket soaks through, you definitely want to pair this with a dedicated rain shell if heavier storms are in your future.

Durability

The 20-denier recycled polyester ripstop shell fabric used on the Nano Puff offers middle-of-the-road durability for off-trail travel. While it held up fine to most of what I put it through, I was still gentle with it while scrambling around boulders or pushing through blowdowns.

For everyday casual use around town or occasional backcountry forays, the Nano Puff works great. If you tend to frequently wander off trail, however, it might be good to pick a jacket with beefier fabric.

Packed Size

The Nano Puff is one of the more compressible synthetic jackets I’ve tested, and it easily shoves into its zippered internal chest pocket. The PrimaLoft Gold Eco insulation packs down smaller than other types of synthetic fill (such as Polartec Alpha), which makes it a solid piece for multipitch climbs, as it easily clips onto a harness without adding much bulk.

The jacket’s slim design and lack of features contribute to its stellar packability, as well as its sleek, stylish look. Despite its small size, it isn’t the lightest jacket on the market, and there are definitely models with a better warmth-to-weight ratio out there. Its minimal profile makes this point hard to gripe about though, and I found it light enough for pretty much everything I needed it for.

Key Features

The Nano Puff has one of the more streamlined, unembellished designs of the synthetic jackets I’ve tried out, and the simplicity was honestly kind of refreshing. The lack of bells and whistles on this jacket has made it a mega-popular crossover piece for a stylish look on trail, or while walking the dog around the neighborhood.

The two hand-warmer pockets are lined with comfortable fabric, and the internal chest pocket gives the front of the jacket a clean, sleek look. The front zipper features a wicking interior storm flap and a generous zipper garage at the top for next-to-skin comfort.

One small complaint is that the inside of the collar seems to stain quite easily after wearing it a few times. This may be because it runs quite close to the neck, or maybe it is just the material used in this part of the jacket. I only say this because I haven’t noticed it to be a problem on similar puffies.

Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket: Conclusion

An iconic, durable, and versatile layer, the Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket holds a place in the synthetic insulation hall of fame. The newest edition carries on its tradition as a reliable workhorse for casual wear, or on rugged adventures in the backcountry. Its minimal weight and high compressibility promise not to slow you down or add too much bulk to your pack.

If you need maximum warmth for high-alpine pursuits, or lightweight breathability for fast pushes on the trail, there are better jackets designed specifically for those activities. As a do-it-all layer for a diversity of terrains and climates, however, the Nano Puff is still one of the best options out there.",['Chris Carter'],2023-03-14 19:34:06+00:00
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/patagonia-founder-incredible-salesforce-marc-benioff-211440787.html,"Patagonia founder giving away company is 'inspiring and incredible,' Salesforce's Marc Benioff says","Salesforce Chair and Co-CEO Marc Benioff — long seen as one of the most philanthropic executives in corporate America — offered a hat tip to Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard.

Chouinard stunned many this month by saying he will essentially give away his company, valued at about $3 billion some half-century after its founding, to fight climate change.

""I think that it's very inspiring and incredible what he has done,"" Benioff told Yahoo Finance Live at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference in San Francisco (video above).

The billionaire, his wife, and their two adult children have transferred their ownership of Patagonia to a specially created trust and nonprofit, the New York Times reported. The business's annual profits, estimated at around $100 million, will go toward addressing climate change and protecting undeveloped land around the globe.

Chouinard ""led with his values through the entire lifetime of the company,"" Benioff added. ""And he is setting a high mark for what is possible for entrepreneurs. I think entrepreneurs in the future will look to Patagonia as the way to do it.""

Benioff, who was among the first billionaires to sign the Giving Pledge, continued his own philanthropic efforts this week at the Dreamforce conference.

Salesforce announced $25 million in new grants to support school districts and education nonprofits across the U.S. This year marks the tenth anniversary of Salesforce's commitment to improving education, and the company's total donations to public schools now tally $165 million.

Meanwhile, Benioff and his wife, Lynne, made a gift of $60 million to UC Santa Barbara this week. The gift aligns with the couple's efforts to fight climate change as UC Santa Barbara is seen as one of the world's best marine research centers.

Benioff also said that Chouinard's decision to donate Patagonia has pushed him to consider what else could be possible on the charitable front.

Story continues

""It's honestly just very inspiring to me — that there's many people out there who believe that business is the greatest platform for change and that they can use their businesses to improve the state of the world,"" Benioff said.

""When I went to college, the business of business was business,"" the CEO continued, ""and today, the business of business is improving the state of the world. You look at the Patagonia founder, but I can give you many examples of many CEOs who realized they have incredible corporate resources, and they can use those corporate resources to improve the world.""

https://nextcity.org/urbanist-news/how-this-local-restaurant-is-taking-the-patagonia-approach,How This Local Restaurant Is Taking The Patagonia Approach,"Patagonia’s owner “gave the company away” for a cause. Here’s how a cause acquired a local seafood restaurant in Newport, Oregon.

This is your first of three free stories this month. Become a free or sustaining member to read unlimited articles, webinars and ebooks.

Every year, Laura Anderson gives dozens of what she calls “Dock Walks.”

They start at Local Ocean Seafoods, right on Newport’s downtown waterfront, called the Bayfront. In 2005, Anderson co-opened the beloved local restaurant and seafood market, which this month adopted a rare alternative ownership model similar to what Patagonia’s owner did for his multi-billion dollar company this past summer.

Anderson often starts the Dock Walk explaining how she comes from a fishing family, and grew up catching salmon and crabbing on her father’s commercial fishing boat. After sharing her family’s fishing history, she tells attendees about the seafood laid out for sale in the display case at the front of the restaurant. A majority of species in the display case, she explains, as well as seafood cooked and served at Local Ocean, comes off the boats like her father’s, all of which are docked right outside the restaurant, across the street at Newport’s main commercial marina.

“Then we go down on the docks,” Anderson says. “Usually on the inside fingers are the smaller boats. Then on the outer fingers are typically the larger boats, but really there’s no boat in our fleet that gets too far over 80 feet. They’re all much smaller than, say, a large Alaskan boat or a super trawler, anything like that.”

Some of the questions from Dock Walkers these days can get pretty thorny: How much fishing is too much? How do you effectively regulate the industry? How is climate change affecting things? There may not always be clear answers, but Anderson is well-equipped to discuss, with a master’s degree from Oregon State University’s interdisciplinary program in Marine Resource Management. There, she studied how human beings manage their relationships with bodies of water and everything in them.

The Dock Walk ends back at the restaurant with a meal, of course. Between the restaurant and “DockBox,” a CSA-like seafood DIY home meal kit program created to keep the restaurant afloat during the pandemic, Local Ocean now employs nearly 80 people. The tourist season this past summer was one of their biggest yet. Anderson could hardly have picked a better moment to sell the business — but not to another person, not even to another group of people.

She didn’t technically sell it to anybody. Anderson sold Local Ocean to its mission.

Local Ocean’s new owner is a special purpose trust meant to protect the business’s mission of supporting the local, sustainable commercial seafood industry. There are some similarities with this summer’s announcement from Patagonia, in which the clothing company’s founder gave away his ownership of the company to a new structure that is intended to protect Patagonia’s larger mission around environmental sustainability. (Check out a webinar I hosted on Patagonia’s move and the perpetual purpose trust model.)

But there are some big differences. In Local Ocean’s case, Anderson didn’t have to give away her business; she received a fair price for the sale, like any typical small business owner selling their company. And Local Ocean isn’t a prominent multinational brand, but a beloved local business that happens to have a strong sense of social purpose beyond profits.

It took a variety of institutions behind the scenes to help convert the business to its new ownership structure, but those institutions are very much looking to work with other businesses with similarly strong social purposes to achieve the same goal of selling to mission.

Originally from Portland, Elizabeth “Issie” Corvi first learned about Local Ocean on a Dock Walk when she was out in Newport for a semester, studying marine biology as an undergrad at OSU. She came to work at Local Ocean as a back-office worker after returning to Newport for her graduate studies in 2019. She rose through the ranks quickly, and is now serving as Local Ocean’s interim CEO under the new ownership structure. Anderson remains in a leadership role as CFO.

“I’m a marine biologist working in a seafood restaurant,” Corvi says. “Applying for a part-time job here, it was intimidating. This definitely is not the job I thought I was going to have while in school.”

Anderson says she had been thinking about some kind of employee ownership structure since Local Ocean’s early days. She even kept a file of readings and documents for Employee Stock Ownership Plans, or ESOPs, the most popular form of employee ownership across the country. But those plans were waylaid by the chaos of managing a growing business, which included acquiring Local Ocean’s building from its previous landlord, back in 2014.

When Anderson came up for air in 2021, the roughest days of the COVID-19 pandemic were behind her, and the ecosystem for employee ownership conversions had become much more robust. There were more feasible options to discuss beyond ESOPs. To get the conversation going, Anderson turned to the Oakland-based nonprofit Project Equity. As Next City covered previously, Project Equity launched an initiative in 2019 to support more legacy business owners with conversions to various forms of employee-ownership.

In early 2021, over Zoom, Project Equity laid out the options during a kickoff meeting with Anderson and more than a dozen of Local Ocean’s staff, including Corvi, service staff, and line cooks.

ESOPs were one of the options. But Anderson had already started moving away from the model. While there can be exceptions, it generally ends up operating more like a retirement benefit for employees who have stuck with the same company for many years, and the restaurant business has a notoriously high turnover rate.

“I did not believe that deferring benefits until retirement would be a viable way to engage our young workforce,” Anderson says. “We’re an industry that is known for having quite a bit of turnover — young people, first job. So trying to get people to feel like they have ownership or have benefits when they’re not going to see that benefit for 40 years in the future is just not compelling.”

High turnover also became an argument against a worker-owned cooperative structure. While there are some exceptions among restaurants, it’s generally challenging for employees in a high-turnover environment to buy-in as cooperative owners and participate in long-term planning.

But there was a third option presented at that first meeting with Project Equity. It still goes by different names, since it’s a newer option and it comes in a few different variants — steward ownership, perpetual purpose trust or employee-ownership trust. Local Ocean has been using the last variety, since it is prioritizing employees in its new ownership structure.

But technically the employees aren’t owners — nobody is the owner. The new special purpose trust that owns Local Ocean is not a person, it’s a legal entity meant to represent the broader social mission of the business, which includes providing dignified, well-paying jobs.

“What I really like about the trust is that there is no ownership,” Anderson says. “It’s the end of ownership. The trust is not a person, the trust does not need income, the trust just holds the purpose.”

Part of the inspiration behind the new model came from Organically Grown Company, another Oregon business and one of the leaders in the organic food movement. As Next City covered in 2019, Organically Grown Company had its own journey through various ownership structures including an ESOP, but eventually converted into a steward ownership model. Organically Grown Company’s journey even compelled a successful movement in Oregon to create a new special purpose trust entity under the state’s trust law.

After deciding to go with a steward ownership model, Local Ocean brought in Alternative Ownership Advisors to facilitate the months-long process to build out the special purpose trust under Oregon’s new special purpose trust law. Alternative Ownership Advisors is actually an affiliate of Organically Grown Company, created after that company’s conversion to support others doing the same.

Over the course of a few months, a smaller group of Local Ocean employees, including Corvi and some of her longer-tenured colleagues, sat down to hash out the values and principles that the trust would eventually be empowered to uphold. They eventually settled around a dozen core principles, with one or more key metrics to monitor or track progress. The metrics aren’t set in stone. Part of Corvi’s job now is reporting on them and figuring out if there are more or better ways for the business to live up to its core principles.

“We started with a huge whiteboard,” Corvi says. “At the time, we were very in this mindset of using a kind of a triple bottom line mentality, people and planet and profit, helping categorize and think about the work we do, sorting out the core values that we had written up from the past and our mission and our other visions and desires into buckets. It was definitely an iterative process.”

Next, the group had to decide the composition and the process to select the trust stewardship committee – the actual set of folks who control the trust. In Local Ocean’s case, its trust stewardship committee consists of two to three employees, one Local Ocean board member, and one to two community members with experience in sustainable seafood or the food industry. The initial trust stewardship committee’s employee representatives will be picked out by the restaurant’s current leadership, but after their initial terms are up, employees will get to elect their representatives on the trust stewardship committee.

“Really, how we’ve developed our perpetual purpose trust is about the employees more than anything else, our fishermen partners, and then our local community,” Corvi says.

While some of the fundamental elements around a small business owner selling to mission are wildly different from a conventional sale, some are the same. Similar to selling a business conventionally, unless the owner is already wealthy enough and not interested in profiting from the sale, selling to mission still relies on the leveraged buyout structure.

In a leveraged buyout, the business itself takes out a loan to cover at least part of the cost of buying out the previous owner or owners, then the business transfers its controlling shares to the new ownership — be it another person or a private equity firm, or in the case of Local Ocean ownership, a special purpose trust incorporated under state law in Oregon. The main advantage of using a leveraged buyout structure when selling to a mission is that the special purpose trust doesn’t need to have any cash of its own to acquire the business.

But it can still be a challenge for a business to get a loan to finance a leveraged buyout if its new owner isn’t an individual or an investor. Anderson says they went to a traditional bank first, but she says the bank couldn’t do the deal without collateral from the business. Often in a conventional buyout situation, instead of business collateral, a traditional bank can access a federal loan guarantee from the U.S. Small Business Administration — but that program requires the new owner to sign a personal guarantee, essentially putting up their personal assets like a home or vehicles up for collateral. The trust is neither a person nor did it own any assets before acquiring Local Ocean, so it can’t sign a personal guarantee.

Instead, working with Alternative Ownership Advisors, Local Ocean Seafoods turned to Shared Capital Cooperative, a community development financial institution based in the Twin Cities. Shared Capital was created in 1978 to make loans to cooperatives, including housing co-ops, food co-ops and worker-owned co-ops. It now works all across the country, and since it specializes in lending to co-ops that don’t have a traditional ownership structure, Shared Capital doesn’t require personal guarantees for any of its loans.

Although Local Ocean isn’t technically a co-op, Shared Capital Cooperative senior loan officer Mark Fick says the employee voice built into its new ownership model was robust enough to convince the community development lender that the loan represented an expansion of the cooperative movement as it was founded to support.

“We are underwriting the democracy within the business as well as the finances of the business,” Fick says.

https://www.seattletimes.com/business/patagonia-to-pay-55000-after-allegedly-violating-seattle-scheduling-law/,"Patagonia to pay $55,000 after allegedly violating Seattle scheduling law","Outdoor retailer Patagonia will pay nearly $55,000 to current and former Seattle retail employees after allegedly failing to post their schedules with enough notice.

The company settled the allegations with Seattle’s Office of Labor Standards and agreed to pay $54,654 to 95 employees, plus a $575 fine to the city, the office announced Wednesday. Patagonia employs about 25 people at its Belltown store. The alleged violations spanned from May 2019 to April 2022.

Patagonia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The California-based retailer has for years cultivated a progressive reputation, recently offering to pay bail for employees arrested protesting for abortion rights, pulling its merchandise from a Wyoming ski resort that hosted U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and suing the Trump administration over its decision to reduce the size of two Utah monuments.

Steven Marchese, director of the Office of Labor Standards, said in a statement that after Patagonia was confronted with the allegations, it agreed to pay “all employees impacted” by the alleged violations.

Seattle’s secure scheduling law requires large retail and food service companies to post hourly employees’ schedules at least two weeks in advance, pay employees when the company changes the schedule after it’s posted and pay workers extra when they have fewer than 10 hours between closing and opening shifts (known as “clopening”).

Chains such as Fred Meyer, Qdoba and California Pizza Kitchen have settled with the city after allegations under the law in recent years. Trader Joe’s agreed this spring to pay about $44,500.

The city says 5,652 workers have received a total of about $5.6 million for alleged violations of the law since it took effect in 2017.",['Seattle Times Business Reporter'],2022-07-13 11:04:15
https://www.mashed.com/644213/the-real-reason-patagonia-launched-its-own-line-of-wine/,The Real Reason Patagonia Launched Its Own Line Of Wine,"Patagonia is your go-to destination for warm jackets, athletic tees, and ... wine? The outdoor apparel company is perhaps best known for its cozy fleeces, parkas, and insulated down jackets, but that may be about to change. The brand has revealed the newest additions to its list of products: natural wines, ciders, and sake. Eight wines, which include a Meinklang Rosé for $25, a French Château de Béru Chablis for $48, and a Wild Arc Marquette from New York's Hudson Valley for $30, are already available through the Patagonia Provisions website.

A new traditional organic rice sake and a dry hard Alai Sidra cider from the Chilean Andes are scheduled to be released in late November, according to Food & Wine. And while it might seem like a bit of a strange move for an outdoor company to venture into the wine business, the brand sought to assure any potential doubters that it might not be as unusual as it initially seems. According to Patagonia, the decision to begin collaborating with growers, winemakers, and artisans to start selling wine was all about pursuing a ""connection to place.""",['Aimee Lamoureux'],2021-10-26 21:54:29+00:00

https://www.vogue.com/article/patagonias-owner-has-given-away-his-company,Patagonia’s Owner Has Given Away His Company–Proving Fashion Can Be a Force for Good,"Patagonia has long been revered by those in the industry who believe fashion can be a force for good. But founder Yvon Chouinard has taken his vision of what a responsible business should look like one step further, by giving away his entire company—believed to be worth $3 billion (£2.6 billion)—in a bid to tackle the climate crisis.

“It’s been a half-century since we began our experiment,” Chouinard, 83, said in a statement. “If we have any hope of a thriving planet 50 years from now, it demands all of us doing all we can with the resources we have. As the business leader I never wanted to be, I am doing my part. Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth, we are using the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source. We’re making Earth our only shareholder. I am dead serious about saving this planet.”

Chouinard and his family have handed 98 per cent of their shares to a newly-created non-profit, named the Holdfast Collective, which will now receive an estimated $100 million (£86 million) a year—comprising all the profits from Patagonia that aren’t invested back into the company. The remaining two per cent of their shares have been transferred to a trust, which is designed to ensure the company is staying true to its purpose and values.

The outdoors company, which achieved B-Corp status back in 2012, will continue to donate one per cent of all its sales every year to grassroot activists. Meanwhile, the Holdfast Collective will use all its funds to “protect nature and biodiversity, support thriving communities and fight the environmental crisis.”

Founded by Chouinard, a former rock climber, in Ventura, California, in 1973, Patagonia has been a trailblazer in the industry for the past 50 years, with the company first donating 10 per cent of its profits to grassroot groups working to save or restore habitats back in 1986. Never afraid to go against the grain, the brand famously placed an advert in the New York Times on Black Friday in 2011, with the tagline: “Don’t buy this jacket”. Ahead of the 2020 election in the US, Patagonia released a pair of shorts that had “Vote the assholes out” written on the tag.","['Condé Nast', 'Emily Chan']",2022-09-15 13:35:47.347000+00:00
https://hbr.org/2022/10/what-happens-when-a-company-like-patagonia-becomes-a-nonprofit,What Happens When a Company (Like Patagonia) Transfers Ownership to a Nonprofit?,"Patagonia will now be run by a nonprofit foundation. The shift generated a lot of headlines, but outside of the U.S. this form of ownership is not new. “Shareholder foundations” have quietly prospered for decades in continental Europe, particularly in Denmark where a quarter of the largest 100 firms are foundation-owned, including the three largest firms in the country: Carlsberg, Maersk, and Novo Nordisk. The authors’ analysis of these firms suggests they can succeed as businesses, and that the arrangement helps simplify some of the tradeoffs that for-profit companies typically face when considering social responsibility.

On September 14, Yvon Chouinard, the owner of Patagonia, publicly donated all his voting stock to the Patagonia Purpose Trust, and all his nonvoting stock to the Holdfast Collective, a nonprofit organization “dedicated to fighting the environmental crisis and defending nature.” The move was intended to shield the company from the “pressure to create short-term gain at the expense of long-term vitality and responsibility,” while simultaneously creating long-term funding for philanthropic causes around environmentalism.

Patagonia’s move follows other American companies that have undergone a similar transformation in ownership structure. For instance, the family-owned, Pennsylvania-based construction firm High Industries, which had revenues of $570 million in 2021, announced earlier this year that their eponymous High Foundation would assume control and ownership. A few years ago, such arrangements would have been impossible; a 1969 tax-reform law limited foundation ownership in corporations to 20%. In 2018, however, new tax legislation passed allowing charitable organizations to hold 100% of voting rights in a corporation. Accordingly, we can expect to see more of these foundations emerge in the future.

Outside of the U.S., this form of ownership is not new. “Shareholder foundations” have quietly prospered for decades in continental Europe, particularly in Denmark, where a quarter of the largest 100 firms are foundation-owned, including the three largest firms in the country: Carlsberg, Maersk, and Novo Nordisk. In many instances, the initiative comes from successful senior entrepreneurs like Chouinard, who decide to bequeath ownership of their company to a newly created foundation to ensure the long-term stability of both business and philanthropic activities. In some cases, a foundation controls both voting and equity shares. In others, like Patagonia, two entities are formed: a trust or holding retaining control through voting rights, and a foundation with the equity and philanthropic activities.

In collaboration with the philanthropy consultancy firm Prophil, we have studied shareholder foundations in Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, and France and have developed important insights on how they operate.

Firstly, despite claims that firms will flounder without human owners and “market discipline,” foundation-owned firms have similar (and in some cases superior) financial performance compared with their investor-owned counterparts. Danish corporate governance researchers have demonstrated the benefits of this ownership structure: Foundation-owned firms have more stable growth, are less volatile during crises, invest more in R&D, and have a longer lifespan compared with conventionally owned firms.

The second insight concerns philanthropy. For firms listed on the stock market, corporate philanthropy is “nice to have,” but is often secondary to profit maximization. Oftentimes, the two are in conflict: For instance, out of thousands of companies accorded B-Corp (Benefit Corporation) certification, only four have managed to go public in the U.S., one of which surrendered its status shortly after being listed in order to become more profit-oriented. The shareholder foundation model pragmatically overcomes this tradeoff: Because the shareholder is a philanthropic foundation, maximizing shareholder returns (via dividends) also maximizes potential donations. Given the size and revenues of many foundation-owned firms, the philanthropic budgets of shareholder foundations can be substantial.

A third insight concerns legacy. For firm owners focused on maintaining their economic and philanthropic mission in the long term, there are few compelling options available to them. Selling or listing a company rarely leaves the founder’s vision intact, but family succession is no less problematic because subsequent generations might mismanage it. Beyond this, there is the risk in some countries that high succession taxes will dilute ownership over time. As a result, only 10% of family businesses survive as privately-owned entities by the third generation, as exemplified by the adage “shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations.” The foundation skirts this issue by creating an entity that will guard the values of the founder in perpetuity — even if that means their children relinquish much (if not all) their inheritance in the process.

Nonetheless, our research has also revealed important governance considerations that Patagonia will face. The first is board composition: What balance must be struck in terms of corporate, philanthropic, and family representation, to ensure that no one party dominates decision-making in the long-term? Another involves decisions around profit allocation: Should profit be issued as a dividend to fund philanthropic activities or reinvested back in the firm? A third question involves whether to integrate philanthropy with corporate activities: As an example, the Novo Nordisk foundation funds basic science at Danish universities, and in doing so develops research (and researchers) that may benefit their pharmaceutical firms. If Patagonia followed a similar path, would it appear self-serving?

These challenges should discourage neither Chouinard nor his family (who will be involved in the decision-making of both entities). Many foundation-owned companies that establish a successful balance go on to outperform their competition on multiple dimensions. Take the Robert Bosch Group, for instance, which is 94% owned by the Robert Bosch Foundation and 5% by the family, while their major competitor, the Siemens Group, is 65% owned by institutional investors like BlackRock, 23% by private investors, and 6% by the Siemens family. These are comparable companies: two leading German conglomerates, competitors in several markets, with similar economic performance (about 80 billion euros in sales and 5 billion euros in net income). However, as a shareholder, the Bosch Foundation spends roughly 100 million euros annually in philanthropic donations. That’s 10 times the amount distributed yearly by the Siemens Foundation, a traditional corporate foundation. The structure also provides an element of stability and resilience in turbulent times. In contrast to Siemens, Bosch avoided massive layoffs during the Great Recession while increasing sales and remaining profitable over the subsequent decade.

As shareholder foundations become adopted by more American companies, they will undoubtedly be shaped by the legal, cultural and political environment in the U.S., which differs starkly from those in European economies. Nonetheless, such foundations have a track record of success, resilience and responsibility in many of the countries in which they are present. In uncertain times characterized by market volatility, rising inequality, and ecological crises, Chouinard will hopefully inspire more successful business owners to explore the possibilities of foundation ownership.",[],2022-10-10 12:25:18+00:00
https://www.philanthropy.com/article/why-patagonias-purpose-driven-business-model-is-unlikely-to-spread,Why Patagonia’s Purpose-Driven Business Model Is Unlikely to Spread,"Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard, his wife, Malinda, and their two adult children no longer own the outdoor gear and apparel company. But based on my experience as a former executive who is now an adviser and lecturer focused on sustainability, I don’t expect many other U.S.-based companies to follow their lead.

Going forward, all of Patagonia’s profits, some $100 million annually, will fund efforts to address climate change and advance wilderness preservation, the company announced on September 14.

In a letter posted to the company’s site, Yvon Chouinard noted that “instead of going public” by selling Patagonia shares to investors, “you could say we’re ‘going purpose.’” The family has permanently transferred its ownership to a trust and a nonprofit.

By “purpose,” Chouinard means that the company’s profits will be used to protect the planet, as opposed to enriching shareholders. I see this choice as a valiant extension of Patagonia’s years of struggle to make capitalism more compatible with planetary sustainability. It also acknowledges the difficulty of trying to balance the interests of employees, customers, and shareholders with the precarious state of the planet.

Urging Customers to Buy Less

Chouinard stumbled into entrepreneurship as a “dirtbag” rock climber. Dissatisfied with the damage done to mountains by climbing equipment, he began to forge his own gear, initially doing all the work himself and then employing others. He remained a reluctant capitalist even as he founded Patagonia in 1973.

One example of this reluctance was a famous full-page ad his company ran in the New York Times on Black Friday in November 2011. Rather than lure shoppers with doorbuster sales and early opening hours, Patagonia implored its customers not to buy the company’s signature synthetic fleece jacket and to “buy less” of everything.

ADVERTISEMENT

The ad lamented “the culture of consumption … [that] puts the economy of natural systems that support all life firmly in the red.”

Though Patagonia’s ad made a big splash, I didn’t find it surprising. Several years earlier I had visited Chouinard at Patagonia’s headquarters in Ventura, Calif.

At the time, I recall being wowed by the on-site day care center, the company’s pledge to donate 1 percent of its revenue to “the preservation and restoration of the natural environment” and the employees I witnessed heading out to surf in the middle of the day. In person, Chouinard seemed even more strident and less commercially motivated than I had imagined.

Perhaps ironically, given Patagonia’s seemingly anti-commercial posture, the company’s sales continued to grow, reaching more than an estimated $1 billion annually.

Seeing his name listed in the Forbes exclusive list of the richest people made Chouinard recoil, saying “it really pissed me off.”

Timberland’s Approach

At the time of that California visit, I was serving as the chief operating officer of Timberland, an outdoor footwear, apparel, and accessories company. Like Patagonia, it was privately controlled at the time — it has since become part of VF Corporation, a publicly traded outdoor-focused conglomerate.

ADVERTISEMENT

Timberland’s model blended “commerce and justice” by combining the pursuit of profit with respect for global human rights, support for community service, and a commitment to environmental stewardship.

Timberland was one of the first companies in the world to issue a corporate social-responsibility report, paid for all employees to perform 40 hours of community service and was one of the last companies to continue to manufacture millions of shoes and boots in its own factories.

Patagonia and Timberland have both earned acclaim and awards for their creative attempts to demonstrate that business can serve not just shareholders but also employees, local communities, and other stakeholders.

Business Roundtable

Chouinard’s choice to “go purpose” seems to be a more dramatic version of a historic declaration issued by the Business Roundtable in August 2019.

The group represents close to 200 chief executives, including the leaders of JPMorgan Chase, Apple, BlackRock, and Walmart. Appearing to abandon its longstanding commitment to shareholder primacy, it recast the purpose of a corporation.

“We share a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders,” including suppliers, employees, communities, and the environment,“ the group declared in what many observers saw as a shift to a more balanced and responsible form of capitalism.

ADVERTISEMENT

In my view, however, current systems, structures and incentives ensure that revenue and profit growth remain sacrosanct for companies. As a result, calls by well-intentioned advocates for more focus on social or environmental issues remain no match for a model governed by the pressure to deliver short-term results.

So far, business as usual remains the norm.

Unlike Chouinard’s decision to allocate 100 percent of Patagonia’s profits to environmental causes, the Business Roundtable’s 2019 statement is nonbinding and doesn’t compel companies to do anything differently.

Research published in 2020 seems to confirm that the Roundtable’s new statement of purpose was mostly performative. Since its release, close to 100 of the companies that belong to the group have updated their governance guidelines, but very few had “made any changes to their statement of corporate purpose.”

In addition, the researchers examined 26 proposals that shareholders had introduced with the goal of implementing the Roundtable’s statement. “Each company invariably opposed these proposals,” the study observed.

Rational Executives

Chouinard’s remake of Patagonia’s governance acknowledges an important reality.

ADVERTISEMENT

When presented with a situation in which social welfare and private profits align, companies will act sustainably. However, when circumstances pit public welfare against a company’s bottom line, executives typically side with their shareholders.

This does not make most executives evil; it makes them rational. They are responding to capitalism’s current system rules and incentives.

That’s why I find Chouinard’s imaginative act of moral courage uplifting.

At the same time, I believe that it would be naive and even harmful to expect many others to follow his example by voluntarily choosing a purpose other than the pursuit of profits.

Expecting businesses to do so would relieve government of its responsibility to set different rules to protect the environment and address climate change. I also agree with David Gelles, the New York Times reporter who broke the story about Patagonia’s new governance structure. As Gelles noted in a Vox interview, Chouinard’s family is “one of one.”

https://nypost.com/2022/09/15/patagonia-hands-company-over-to-planet-earth/,Patagonia hands company over to Planet Earth,"The founder of Patagonia has relinquished his company to Planet Earth.

In a letter, Yvon Chouinard said he was inspired by the unrelenting climate crisis to reroute nearly all of the company’s profits to environmental preservation organizations.

“Instead of ‘going public,’ you could say we’re ‘going purpose,'” Chouinard wrote in the statement titles, “Earth is now our only shareholder.”

“Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth.”

The $3 billion company will continue making activewear and gear, as well as operating as a for-profit business. Patagonia will use profits as needed to reinvest in the company and compensate employees, but all other wealth will be given to its new owners Holdfast Collective and Patagonia Purpose Trust.

Holdfast Collective, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting biodiversity and nature, owns 98% of Patagonia and will use all of the company’s nonvoting stock to invest in environmental protection projects.

The newly formed Patagonia Purpose Trust will own the remaining 2% of the company. It will oversee the company’s voting stock, meaning has the right to approve key company decisions and board member appointments. The trust was created to protect the company’s mission of saving the planet.

Denis Hayes, who coordinated the first Earth Day and later became the CEO of the environmentally focused Bullitt Foundation in Seattle, applauded the groundbreaking decision.

“The concept of putting this together in a new structure and being experimental and bold is exactly the kind of innovation we need to be trying,” Hayes told NBC.

In his letter, Chouinard said he never intended on becoming a businessman, even telling The New York Times he abhors wealth.

“I was in Forbes magazine listed as a billionaire, which really, really pissed me off,” he told the paper. “I don’t have $1 billion in the bank. I don’t drive Lexuses.”

Chouinard gained notoriety as a rock climber in the ’60s, but dabbled in various outdoor sports, such as ice climbing, kayaking, surfing and more.

He started Patagonia in 1973 and dedicated the company to environmentalism nearly from the get-go. In 2002, Chouinard founded 1% for the Planet, making Patagonia become the first business to commit 1% of annual sales to natural causes. Chouinard said Patagonia will continue the practice of donating the percentage to grassroots even as ownership changes hands.

“Despite its immensity, the Earth’s resources are not infinite, and it’s clear we’ve exceeded its limits. But it’s also resilient. We can save our planet if we commit to it,” Chouinard said.","['Social Links For Katherine Donlevy', 'Contact The Author']",2022-09-15 00:00:00

With a stroke of the pen, ""the Chouinards are renouncing their status as one of the wealthiest families in America."" Channeling Patagonia's $100 million in annual profits into the new nonprofit, the Holdfast Collective, ""immediately established an entity that will become one of the nation's biggest funders of climate causes."" They're not the first billionaires to do something like this. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has pledged $10 billion to his Bezos Earth Fund, and Laurene Powell Jobs, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' widow, is pitching in $3.5 billion to another group to support climate action.

Chouinard told The New York Times in an exclusive interview that he never wanted to run a business in the first place. Patagonia sells more than $1 billion worth of jackets, hats, ski pants, and other outdoor apparel every year. This arrangement will direct all the company's profits into buying up sensitive land and fighting climate change, ensuring that it keeps pushing Chouinard's mission long after he's gone. ""Hopefully this will influence a new form of capitalism that doesn't end up with a few rich people and a bunch of poor people,"" Chouinard told the Times. ""We are going to give away the maximum amount of money to people who are actively working on saving this planet."" Is this as good for Earth as Chouinard makes it sound?

Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard, 83, announced last week that he was giving away the $3 billion outdoor-apparel company he founded to help fight climate change. He said he and his family were giving 100 percent of the company's voting stock to the Patagonia Purpose Trust , which the family will oversee to make sure Patagonia remains socially responsible and honors its environmental commitments. Chouinard said 100 percent of Patagonia's nonvoting stock, equivalent to about 98 percent of the company, would go to the Holdfast Collective, a nonprofit dedicated to ""fighting the environmental crisis and defending nature."" The family will pay $17 million in taxes connected to the transfer. ""Earth is now our only shareholder,"" the unconventional entrepreneur wrote in a letter posted on the company's website.

But ""the Chouinard gift stands apart"" from these and other big gifts, because instead of endowing a school or handing over a pile of cash, ""the Patagonia founder has relinquished the company and pledged its future profits toward things like protecting undeveloped land and supporting regenerative agriculture."" Plus, the Holdfast Collective is a 501(c)(4) group under tax rules, which means it ""can spend money on political efforts"" and help drive the climate debate for generations.

Patagonia won't save the world unless it changes

In ""a world ravaged by the climate crisis,"" it's nice to think a billionaire could swoop in and save the day, says Rachel Donald at The New Republic. A third of Pakistanis have been displaced by deadly floods, while other parts of the planet are, quite literally, on fire. But the media now calling Chouinard a hero should take a look at Patagonia's history of ""misleading consumers over sustainability claims."" Patagonia partnered with Walmart in 2009 to create the Sustainable Apparel Coalition. The group developed the ""dodgy"" Higg Materials Sustainability Index, which critics say tried to ""greenwash"" the use of fossil fuels in manufacturing by rating ""polyester, a fiber derived from petroleum, as the most sustainable of all fibers."" This masks the ""true environmental costs"" while helping the companies maximize profits, ""since polyester is also the cheapest fiber available.""

It's crucial to ""encourage billionaires to redistribute their wealth"" for the good of all. But it's also important to hold them accountable, no matter how generous we think they are. The fawning media coverage about how Chouinard is using capitalism to solve the climate crisis praises the same ""economic system and neo-imperial globalization that has allowed Americans like Chouinard to amass billions in the first place."" It sends the message ""that billionaires could save us from ourselves if only more of them had the Patagonia spirit. Yet given the raw data on billionaires' emissions, it's clear that far more people need to be saved from billionaires than are saved by them.""

Chouinard gets more than you think out of this

Chouinard, who's reportedly worth about $1.2 billion, got the world to see him as a selfless billionaire, says Jim Geraghty in the National Review. But what he failed to make clear is that this route, instead of a sale of the company or a stock offering, allowed the ""self-described socialist"" to avoid paying the U.S. Treasury what he otherwise would have owed for inconvenient things like capital gains, gift, and inheritance taxes. And what changes for Patagonia? It ""keeps making and selling all of its goods, and after everyone gets paid — including CEO Ryan Gellert, who was making $7.7 million per year back in 2013 — the rest of the profits"" go to Chouinard's environmental efforts. A smart move worthy of a guy who wants you to think he got rich accidentally, by ""selling $299 backpacks, $519 sleeping bags, $549 wading boots, and $699 parkas.""

It's good, but scary, that billionaires are doing what governments won't

The ""widespread admiration"" is easy to understand, says Carl Rhodes in The Guardian. ""It is great that Chouinard is putting his company to work for the future of the planet,"" especially since ""governments worldwide have failed for decades"" to take effective action against the climate disaster that is now upon us. ""The rub, however, is that this is all part of a well-developed global system where responsibility for dealing with public and social problems is increasingly taken on by private interests. And, as we see with Chouinard, it is an empowered elite who are able to call the shots.""",['Harold Maass'],2022-09-21 00:00:00
https://www.axios.com/2022/06/24/patagonia-bail-abortion-protests-roe-wade,Patagonia will bail out employees arrested in abortion protests,"Jun 24, 2022 - Economy & Business

Clothing company Patagonia said Friday it will pay bail for employees who peacefully protest for ""reproductive justice.""

Driving the news: The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade earlier Friday, giving states the power to regulate and ban abortion. The decision prompted widespread protests outside the Supreme Court building, and more rallies are planned for across the U.S. this weekend.

Details: Patagonia said in a statement its part-time and full-time U.S. employees ""who peacefully protest for reproductive justice"" receive both training and bail if needed.

Employees on the company's health plan are covered for abortion care, which includes paying for travel, lodging and food where restrictions currently exist, the company said.

Patagonia spokesperson J.J. Huggins told Axios the company has ""had the bail policy in place for many years.""

""The company will post bail for an employee who has previously taken a nonviolent civil disobedience class and is subsequently arrested while peacefully protesting,"" he said.

What they're saying: ""Caring for employees extends beyond basic health insurance, so we take a more holistic approach to coverage and support overall wellness to which every human has a right,"" the company said.

""That means offering employees the dignity of access to reproductive health care.""

The big picture: Companies across the U.S. announced plans to help employees gain access to reproductive care after Friday's Supreme Court ruling.

Disney, Meta, Reddit and gaming chat platform Discord announced they will help their employees find reproductive health care coverage.

Multiple corporations said in May when the U.S. Supreme Court draft ruling leaked that they would help employees cover abortion travel as well.

The owner of Patagonia, who plans to give away the outdoor-apparel retailer to a trust and nonprofit, once lived in his car and still doesn't own a cellphone, The New York Times reported.

Yvon Chouinard was a professional rock climber in California's Yosemite Valley before founding Patagonia in 1973. He used to live out of his car and eat damaged cans of cat food that cost $0.05 each, the newspaper reported.

The 83-year-old ""found gas money by diving into trash cans and redeeming soda pop bottles,"" he wrote in his 2005 book called Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman.

Chouinard wrote that he would spend more than six months a year traveling around North America and the Alps in Europe, catching ground squirrels to eat and sometimes living on just $0.50 a day, Forbes reported.

During this time, he made a living by selling climbing gear out from his car, per Forbes. He later started importing and selling jerseys, gloves, hats, and shorts.

Patagonia has annual sales of more than $1 billion, with profits of about $100 million, The Times reported. The company is valued at about $3 billion.

Yet Chouinard still wears old clothes, drives a rundown Subaru, and has two modest homes in California and Wyoming, according to the newspaper. He doesn't even own a computer or cellphone, it reported.

""I was in Forbes magazine listed as a billionaire, which really, really pissed me off,"" he told The Times. ""I don't have $1 billion in the bank. I don't drive Lexuses.""

On Wednesday, Chouinard said that he was transferring Patagonia to a new trust and nonprofit that will use Patagonia's profits to help combat the climate crisis.

""We needed to find a way to put more money into fighting the crisis while keeping the company's values intact,"" he wrote.

He said that if he'd sold Patagonia and donated the money, he wouldn't have been able to ensure the new owner maintained both its values and employees. Taking the company public would have been a ""disaster,"" Chouinard added.

Chouinard is an avid environmentalist, and he's brought these values to his company, too. Patagonia is a certified B Corporation, was an early adopter of organic cotton, and donates 1% of its sales, with a significant chunk going to environmental causes. In 2016, it gave away all its Black Friday sales to grassroots environmental organizations.

Forbes estimated that Chouinard was worth about $1.2 billion before he gave up control of the company, and reported that the move has pushed him off its billionaires' list.",['Grace Dean'],2022-09-15 00:00:00
https://impakter.com/sustainability-battle-of-brands-patagonia-vs-the-north-face/,Sustainability Battle of Brands: Patagonia vs The North Face,"It’s showtime for the Sustainability Battle of Brands, an Impakter exclusive series that pits global brands against each other — in this case Patagonia and The North Face.

Sustainability of Patagonia

Stretched across the battlefield in tight, neat lines (not literally, but you get the picture), Patagonia makes a formidable foe in the sustainable fashion industry.

When it comes to sustainability, Patagonia caters to three charity-oriented categories:

Product (Worn Wear Program) Donation (1% For the Planet) Activism (action works)

The brand has special programs dedicated to sustainable materials, environmental activism, and social responsibility, tracing all the products back to fair, safe, quality working conditions that adhere to law.

There is full traceability for where and how in the world the clothes are produced. The website features a seasonal progress report that you can track to see whether Patagonia lives up to its goals.

How environmentally friendly is Patagonia?

Patagonia’s battle stance on the environment is one of the most extensive features on its website. This brand is climate-conscious and recognizes the impact that the garment industry has on climate change.

The company is also transparent about the materials they use (at a minimum) that keep them from being 100% sustainable (which, let’s face it, is nearly impossible in the global fashion industry).

Not only are they transparent on the less-than-eco-friendly materials used in fleeces, jackets, and hats, but they also showcase what they do in order to reduce their footprint when non-biodegradable materials are unavoidable.

As much as 89% of the fabrics Patagonia used last season came from preferred materials. Some of their products, like their down jackets, are 100% responsibly sourced, meaning that all materials along the supply chain were obtained through organic, ethical, and sustainable methods.

All of the raw, virgin cotton used in Patagonia clothes is also organic.

Some sustainable materials (out of many) the brand uses include:

Hemp (low-impact material).

REFIBRA lyocell, sourced from wood pulp and recycled cotton scraps from responsible forest management.

Regenerated Organic Certified Cotton, which comes from a farming method that rehabilitates soil and reduces greenhouse gasses.

Polyester, tolerated as a result of its water-repelling characteristics, is one of the (few) non-eco materials Patagonia uses; but Patagonia doesn’t hide this in their tags.

They’re straightforward in addressing that they are aware that polyester comes from petroleum (a material that produced 57 million metric tons in 2021 in the garment industry). To make up for this, Patagonia used recycled polyester in the fall of 2022 so that its fibers no longer reach landfills (quite a lesson, right Nike and Adidas?)

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Patagonia (@patagonia)



Another unsustainable material used is Fluorinated DWR, which is a water-repellent finish used on water-proof garments, and contains nonbiodegradable chemicals like perfluorocarbons (PFCs).

But also like the page on polyester, Patagonia lists their response to making up for this harmful material. By fall 2022, the company converted products containing Fluorinated DWR to a version of it that is PFC-free (10% of products are affected by this new method).

How ethical is Patagonia’s approach to workers’ rights?

Patagonia flat-out tells you that textile workers are some of the most neglected, underpaid workers in the industry.

But not their workers.

In the way that the environment is a major component of Patagonia’s culture, so are the people (which, in this case, are their sustainable soldiers). Some of Patagonia’s top ammunition in this realm include:

87% of the main line is Fair Trade Certified.

64,000+ workers being supported by the Fair Trade Program.

550+ farmers employed by the Regenerative Organic Certified Pilot Cotton Program.

Some of the programs they have include:

Fair Trade Program

Fair Labor Association

Regenerative Organic Certified Programs

Migrant Workers Programs

Living Wage Program

Patagonia works closely with factories and mills to ensure that they adhere to their standards of worker rights so that everyone has access to balanced hours, benefits, and fair wages.

Human rights standards under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 9SB657) monitor supply chain partners to make sure human trafficking and child labor come nowhere near the production partners, as human trafficking affects not only the illegal sex trade but the garment industry, too.

Sustainability of The North Face

The North Face is without a doubt a leader in the outdoor apparel industry. The brand has, apparently, made sustainability a core aspect of its business model.

Yet, with the mounting concerns over the fast fashion and outdoor gear industries’ impact on the environment, can The North Face truly live up to its sustainable claims? Or ar we facing another greenwashing sinner?

Let’s dive in and find out.

So how environmentally friendly is The North Face?

While Patagonia uses 7% more recycled materials in its supply chain, North Face is committed to a circular design, reducing CO2 emissions by half by 2030, and eliminating plastic packaging by 2025 (by packaging items with recyclable materials).

North Face coats are certified by the Responsible Down Standard, which sources feathers from geese and ducks raised on certified farms that meet the label’s animal welfare criteria.

Additionally, under climate goals spearheaded by North Face’s parent company, VF, the brand’s sustainability actions are approved by the Science Based Target Initiatives (SBTi).

The goals aim to attack greenhouse gas emissions that clog the air after manufacturing, and ensure that more renewable energy is used and that “green building standards” are followed.

VF is also linked with Green Bond, a group that directly targets environmental initiatives along the manufacturing value chain and helps VF companies, like North Face, meet sustainable criteria in products, materials, operations, and carbon sinks.

Our first-ever circular collection is here. At the end of its journey, get it back to us and we’ll recycle it for a new life on the trails. Discover circular design: https://t.co/jVqvb1zlEy pic.twitter.com/qxE7O96gmy — The North Face (@thenorthface) October 6, 2022

Green Bond’s 2021 report details VF’s progress in sustainable development, and VF had allocated all of its 2022 net proceeds to Green Bond. Talk about putting your money where your mouth is.

But what about North Face? Why are all the details from VF and not specific to this brand? A lack of transparency threads North Face’s battle plan, and it’s something that touches other aspects of sustainability too.

How ethical is The North Face’s approach to workers’ rights?

This is where North Face starts losing the battle. In 2014, the company was accused of using sweatshop labor with workers that earned only poverty wages (the same happened to Shein by the way). Since then, VF issued a statement apologizing for the reports and reinforcing their commitment to workers’ rights throughout the supply chain.

However, their promise to increase supply chain transparency doesn’t hold a candle to Patagonia; North Face doesn’t have a page, report, or article related to protecting their workers’ human rights (at least not one that we found).

VF can do all the apologizing they want, but at the end of the day, we want to know: what has been done to address the issue moving forward?

And again, where is North Face in all of this? North Face is the face of the issue here; it’s the brand that has a direct relationship with you, the consumer. Because you spend your money on their brand, you shouldn’t have to do an investigation for human rights violations just because you want a puffy new coat.

Patagonia vs The North Face: Who wins in terms of sustainability?

While the sustainability of North Face is outlined extensively (both with VF and their own site), they just don’t compare to the nitty gritty details that Patagonia lays out on their battle maps.

North Face’s materials page alone features just four categories that only give an overview of recycled synthetics, bio-based materials, regenerative materials, and down. On the opposing field, Patagonia’s material page features a whopping 28 materials used in production. This is in addition to the ethical fabric-related programs associated with sustainable sourcing.

This doesn’t even mention the individual pages Patagonia dedicates to recycling, dyeing, and indigo processes (to name a few). This is opposed to no pages on the North Face’s website on how they process materials.

Unlike Patagonia, North Face doesn’t mention what harmful materials they use. And we know they use them since they already admitted to emitting greenhouse gasses. Where is the transparency?

Sure, North Face tells users about their commitment to a circular economy (which reduces landfill waste) and recycled plastic-free packaging, but how can we trace this to real action? Where are the specifics?

Patagonia, on the other hand, really makes sure that no grass grows under their feet. This ethical and sustainable brand devotes the necessary time and effort it takes to integrate biodegradable and recyclable materials into its line.

Plus, they have a culture that cradles workers’ rights as a top priority, according to ethical anti-child labor laws.

Maybe Patagonia spoiled us with high standards. But hey, shouldn’t our sustainability standards be high anyway?

Final Verdict

As the battle smoke recedes, the brand winning the gold medal is… Patagonia, our five-star eco general!

When it comes to the sustainability of Patagonia, the company really makes sure that no grass grows under its feet. This ethical and sustainable brand devotes the necessary time and effort it takes to integrate biodegradable and recyclable materials into its line.

Plus, they have a culture that cradles workers’ rights as a top priority, according to ethical anti-child labor laws.

https://tcbmag.com/what-leaders-can-learn-from-patagonias-founder/,What Leaders Can Learn from Patagonia’s Founder,"On September 14, the B-Corp Patagonia announced that all Patagonia’s future profits will be placed in a trust that benefits environmental protection in perpetuity. A letter by founder Yvon Chouinard, 83, said, “As of now, Earth is our only shareholder. Instead of ‘going public,’ you could say we’re ‘going purpose.’ Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth.”

While Patagonia could simply make a good product and enjoy healthy success—both of which they certainly do—there are many competitors who create products that are arguably equivalent in quality. Patagonia stands apart from the competition because of Chouinard’s dedication to lead and innovate from a values-centric place, going back to the company’s decision in 1985 to donate 1% of all profits to benefit the environment. They also became one of the first B-Corps in California in 2011. “I learned at an early age that it’s better to invent your own game,” Chouinard said in 2011. “Then you can always be a winner.”

Patagonia’s newest move to donate profits in perpetuity changes the conversation around what corporate philanthropy looks like in our capitalist society, and challenges the old business impulse around valuing profit over people. It’s yet unclear what this will mean for other corporate entities, or whether others will follow. But, it’s safe to say this decision is an unorthodox move when a recession is potentially impending, when companies historically decrease their charitable giving. But Patagonia is nothing if not consistent.

Chouinard is more than just an expert in his field; he’s a thought leader. While experts are necessary to keep the world moving, a thought leader helps direct where the world moves. When a company is led by a thought leader rather than an expert, new pathways are forged and industries evolve and take new shapes. Chouinard, along with other thought leaders, tend to capture some consistent qualities in their leadership:

1. Thought leaders break rules and make new ones.

Experts follow trusted conventional wisdom as they go about their work; thought leaders don’t hold themselves hostage to old ways of doing things, but rather they are willing to forge new paths, try doing things differently than they’ve been done before, and often make new rules in the process.

2. Thought leaders center their values in everything they do.

When you know your values and center them in everything you do, you don’t have to consider, “What would a strong leader do in this moment?” Your values will light a clear path.

3. Thought leaders have a personal content strategy.

Every organization needs a content marketing strategy to remain relevant, but the leaders who are able to become shapers of culture and industry beyond their organizations have their own content strategies to talk about how they do things differently.

4. Thought leaders harness the power of storytelling.

Building a clear through-line from where you came from, to how you developed your values, to how that impacts your leadership is key to being an influential force and thought leader.

From living out of his car, to finding passion in nature, to creating a business to fill a need that supported his passion, becoming one of the first B-Corporations in California, to giving away the company’s profits for the betterment of everyone on the planet, Chouinard’s ability to center values and connect them to his company’s mission—and to communicate that story—is central to his impact as a thought leader.

In his storytelling, Chouinard wrote multiple books that combined his personal background with his unique business philosophies, celebrating our human interconnectedness and the health of the planet above individual enrichment. For example, in one of his books, Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman (2005), Chouinard shares how his deep value for the outdoors became part of the fabric (pun intended!) of Patagonia’s company culture in which workers are encouraged to set their own schedules to create space for being in nature. Today’s work-from-home culture is nearly ubiquitous, but in 2005, the idea of allowing employees to set their own hours and—gasp!—go surfing during the day was unheard of. In the book, Chouinard said, “Patagonia exists to challenge conventional wisdom and present a new style of responsible business. We believe the accepted model of capitalism that necessitates endless growth and deserves the blame for the destruction of nature must be displaced. . . . It took fifteen years to write the first edition of this book because it took that long to prove to ourselves that we can break the rules of traditional business and make it not just work but work even better.”

Did you catch the secret ingredient to thought leadership in his quote? Rule breaking. Experts follow the rules; thought leaders break old rules and make better ones. That kind of rule-breaking can be scary for leaders, but leading from a place of fear rarely creates change or success.

Of all the lessons in thought leadership, none are greater than that of storytelling. Stories connect us as humans and shape our perceptions of the world. Storytelling is the most ancient tool for human cohesion and progress. This was true in ancient times and it is true today.

If you are a leader wanting to elevate your expertise into thought leadership, you need a content strategy that creates a through-line from your story, values, and how you are choosing to change the rules. What rules are you breaking in your work, and how do those broken rules connect with your story and values? What rules are you creating? And finally, how can you share your story for impact?

https://news.sap.com/2022/09/the-take-data-patagonia-quest-save-planet/,"The Take: Data, Patagonia & Saving the Planet","What’s News

Privately held Patagonia Inc. recently said it would change its ownership to channel nearly all its profits into a trust, Patagonia Purpose Trust, to fund non-profits and causes dedicated to helping the planet. Founder Yvon Chouinard and his family will own all the voting rights and retain control of the company best known for its high-quality, high-priced outdoor apparel.

They also will control the Holdfast Collective, which will determine where most of Patagonia’s profits go — about $100 million a year. The collective, a non-profit company led by the Chouinard family, will fund ways to help fight climate change, either through donations to charities or to political and environmental causes.

SAP’s Take

While Patagonia will primarily focus on external initiatives, Nate Boudreau, a retail executive at SAP, said he wondered what Patagonia will do within its own operations. “They’re giving all this money — it’s a great idea and it’s really cool to see — but how is the company actually operating?” Boudreau said.

Without giving away a dime, he says Patagonia could make changes using its own data and employing software that could help the company’s own operations, and those of their vendors within its supply chain, to be more sustainable and planet friendly.

“That could be as granular as what material they’re using, how is it made, where is it made and what the impact of that material is on the environment,” he said. “I wonder if their decision-making process is going to change in terms of looking at the sustainability initiatives of the companies that they’re buying from, if that’s going be number one before its money-making number one. I see a lot of people jumping on the Patagonia bandwagon now.”

Patagonia could also use its data to predict its own environmental impact and discover ways to reduce negative effects. The company can also use information technology to help ensure that its bold new strategy succeeds.

“Around $100 million will be donated,” Boudreau said. “Where is it going? How can they track what it’s doing? What are the benefits, and are really get the most bang for their buck in that money? It’s a unique situation because it’s a lot of money that’s going to be yearly. It’s not going to be a one-time payment. It’s going to be something that can be tracked over the course of years.”

Patagonia’s new plan does have its critics. Detractors are quick to point out that its fleeces are made of petroleum-based material. But the company is one of four sportswear brands that have joined together to help recycling technology get to the clothing market more quickly.

“You get a push back whenever you do something good,” Boudreau said. “I think you’re always going to have even more push back when you’re not doing it right or correctly.”

But according to a Deloitte study, Patagonia’s strategy is on the right track. The study found that a majority of consumers would pay more for products from socially responsible companies. Brands that have demonstrated a commitment to sustainability are seeing average sales growth outperform brands without demonstrated commitment fourfold. It also found that 90% of consumers would switch brands to support a good cause or boycott a brand due to irresponsible business practices.

“I think that’s really huge,” Boudreau said.

https://www.wealthmanagement.com/high-net-worth/patagonia-purpose-trust-what-it-and-will-it-work,The Patagonia Purpose Trust: What Is It and Will It Work?,"The New York Times reported in mid-September that Yvon Chouinard, the founder of clothing-maker Patagonia, has transferred the voting stock of this $3 billion company to a purpose trust (representing 2% of the value of the company) and the nonvoting stock (representing 98% of the value of the company and which receives the annual profits of the company worth $100 million) to a private foundation. This structure was decided upon as the best way of meeting Chouinard’s objectives, which includes worker well-being and climate action, and after his children decided that they did not want to own the company.

The alternatives looked at to achieve his objectives included selling the company or going public, making the company into an employee cooperative, donating all of the stock, voting and nonvoting, to a private foundation, and using a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. The fact that he did so highlights the relatively recent development of business purpose trusts in the United States. So, what is a purpose trust and how does it meet Chouinard’s objectives?

Related: Four Lessons From Patagonia Founder Yvon Chouinard Giving Away the Company

Purpose trusts are not new; they are specifically referred to in Section 409 of the Uniform Trust Code, which is adopted in most states, but they are usually associated with specific objectives, such as pet trusts, perpetual care trusts for cemeteries and for social purposes that do not qualify for charitable deductions, such as a social club. The difference between a purpose trust and other private trusts is that the beneficiary of the trust is a purpose, not individual or a group of beneficiaries. The governance of the purpose trust is, at a minimum, a board of trustees to manage the trust and the appointment of a person or committee that can enforce the purpose of the trust, usually called the trust protector. The term of the purpose trust can be for a specific number of years or, in some states, in perpetuity.

Perpetual purpose trusts have, in the past, worked well when the purpose is specific, such as care of a pet, or tied to tangible or real property, such as artwork, family homesteads and, as mentioned, cemeteries. These purposes are relatively immutable and easily defined. There is less experience in the United States of using perpetual business purpose trusts for the control of an operating business, though they have been used elsewhere, like in Europe for centuries. The reason why a business purpose trust may be a challenge to operate is that an operating company has to make money now and into the future, requiring that it continually evolve as the marketplace changes to be profitable and, in the Patagonia case, to fulfill a level of satisfaction for its employees, customers and its community.

Unfortunately, most state statutes enabling the use of purpose trusts set few if any guidelines on how to set up the governance of the trust that controls a business, or business purpose trusts. One of the few that has is Oregon, but this legislation was enacted just before the COVID-19 pandemic, so how well this works in real life is yet to be seen.

The Patagonia Perpetual Trust and the nonprofit Holdfast Collective are, in my opinion, an elegant strategy to achieve Yvon Chouinard’s and his family’s objectives. Through the purpose trust, they will be able to ensure the succession of the management of the company and, hopefully, its profitable existence for decades to come as well as a high level of satisfaction for all of the stakeholders in the company. Through the collective, those public policy and charitable purposes of Chouinard will benefit from the profits of the company.

https://www.thetravel.com/hiking-the-w-trek-torres-del-paine-patagonia/,10 Tips For Hiking The W Trek In Chilean Patagonia (Read Before You Go),"Patagonia is a dream destination for many hikers and outdoor enthusiasts: it’s got mountain peaks, glaciers, vibrant blue lakes, and tons of wildlife. One of the most popular hikes in the region is in Chilean Patagonia, inside the Torres del Paine National Park.

This is home to the W Trek, a once-in-a-lifetime journey through the wilderness over the course of 5 days. Here’s what travelers need to know before departing for the classic W Trek.

10 The Park Entrance Fee Is Paid In Cash On Arrival

To start the trek, travelers must enter Torres del Paine National Park in Chile. The park entrance fee is CLP $7.300 (~$8.62) for a single day and CLP $10.500 (~$12.38) for a +3 day pass.

When paying the fee at the entrance, travelers must have cash in Chilean Pesos because cards are not accepted. Travelers should keep their pass on them throughout the trek as proof of payment.

9 Dress For All Seasons

It’s often said that in Patagonia, hikers can experience all four seasons within a single day. Although the weather tends to be most stable in Autumn (March to May), in the summer, winter, and spring, it’s common to experience sunny skies, rainfall, and heavy winds all within 12 hours.

To ensure comfort in all conditions, hikers must dress for any weather. This means having moisture-wicking clothing, waterproof rain shells, and layering.

8 Plan Your Duration Based On Your Ability

The classic W Trek is completed in 5 days and 4 nights. However, some travelers who are pressed for time choose to do it in 4 days and 3 nights, so they can see more of the park and other parts of the country during their trip.

While this can be tempting, it’s important to understand that accelerating the hike means covering more distance each day. Avid hikers may find this manageable but for beginners, spending less than 5 days on the trail means multiple days of hiking 20+ km at a time.

Be sure to plan the duration of the trek according to your physical fitness level.

7 Bring Your Food (Don’t Buy)

There is food at every campsite and Refugio along the W Trek trail, so hikers will never go hungry if they run out of food during the hike. However, the prices of the food at these Refugios can be astronomical compared to the cost of simply purchasing dried goods in advance and cooking them along the way.

Travelers on a tight budget may want to forego the fancy dinners and packed lunches available on the trek in favor of boiling some water each night and adding it to dehydrated camping meals, instant noodles, and other easy meals that they can carry in their packs.

6 Save Money By Booking Early

There are various options for accommodation at each stop along the W Trek. Grey, Paine Grande, Chileno, and other campgrounds on the route offer basic campsites, premium campsites, or rooms in mountain lodges. Depending on a traveler’s budget, the price of a mountain lodge room or even a premium campsite may be out of the question.

The basic campsites are the most affordable option at $12/per person per night. This option requires the individual to provide their own tent and sleeping bag.

To get this budget-friendly price, backpackers should book their campsite months in advance of the trek, especially if they plan to visit in the high season (December to March). Bookings for January typically open in September and are almost completely full by late October.

5 Leave Your Luggage At Your Hostel

Before arriving at the bucket list destination of Torres del Paine, travelers will spend a night in the town of Puerto Natales. They should ensure their accommodation in Puerto Natales, whether it’s a hostel or hotel, enables them to leave behind their bulky luggage during the hike, so they only have to carry the essentials on the W Trek.

Most hostels allow guests to store their suitcases in a locker while they’re away; ask ahead of time and come prepared with a lock to secure your belongings.

4 Plan To Be Completely Off-Grid

There is little to no cell reception in Torres del Paine National Park, so hikers should plan to be largely off-grid for the duration of the W Trek. This means 5 days with potentially no cell service or Wi-Fi.

Many Refugios offer Wi-Fi for a fee ($4 USD per hour) but the Internet speed is slow. Checking email is possible, but not much else.

3 Bring Or Rent Trekking Poles

On a multi-day trek, using trekking poles can help alleviate the pressure on the knees and makes the journey feel more manageable when facing major inclines.

Consider packing trekking poles for the journey or renting them in Puerto Natales on arrival. During the high season, it can be difficult to secure rentals on short notice.

2 Consider Your Direction And Difficulty Level

The W Trek can be done from East to West or from West To East. Sometimes, the decision on which direction to trek will be determined for the hiker by their tour group or, if hiking alone, based on campsite availability.

However, when given the choice, it’s worth noting that many people consider West to East to be the easier direction to trek. The section of the trail from Campamento Italiano to Refugio Cuernos is more difficult from East to West. It also puts the hardest part of the hike first: the ascent to Mirador Las Torres.

Note, when doing the W Trek as part of the O Circuit, it must be done from West to East.

1 Check The Weather Forecast Before Hiking To Mirador Las Torres

Travelers starting their W Trek from the East will have the pleasure of hiking to the iconic viewpoint at Mirador Las Torres on day 1. Those who hike from West to East will finish their trek with an ascent to this scenic viewpoint.

Regardless of when they plan to arrive at Mirador Las Torres, travelers should check the forecast in advance to ensure good weather and clear skies.

Knowing when the best weather is expected will help them make the choice to ascend to the viewpoint in the evening before heading to camp at Chileno or in the morning, before departing Chileno.",['Robynne Trueman'],2023-01-03 14:00:15+00:00
https://www.environmentalleader.com/2022/10/patagonia-is-committed-to-using-organic-materials-and-100-renewable-energy/,Organic materials and improvements to the Patagonia supply chain,"Patagonia, Inc. makes outdoor clothing and is committed to the environment. The Ventura, Calif.-based company was founded in 1973 and has operated in at least 10 countries worldwide; it has factories in 16 countries. Since 1985, the company has given 1% of its profits to environmental causes. One commitment is to improve the sustainability of the Patagonia supply chain.

The company says its mission is tied to the products it sells: the enterprise profits from marketing outdoor clothing. Patagonia is committed to organic materials and running all its operations using renewable energy. Indeed, the apparel industry is responsible for 6.7% of the globe’s greenhouse gases. It releases as much as 3.29 billion tons of CO2 equivalents annually, according to Quantis.

“We’re already at 100% renewable energy for our owned and operated stores, offices, and distribution centers, but the real challenge comes from materials manufacturing, which accounts for 95% of our emissions,” says Patagonia’s corporate responsibility statement.

In 1996, Patagonia switched to using only organically-grown cotton. Cotton is the world’s most widely used fiber, and organically-grown cotton is a small subset of that. According to Vesti la Natura, organic cotton excludes pesticides, fertilizers, herbicides, and 1000 other toxic substances harmful to the environment and human health.

Its other goals include:

— eliminating virgin petroleum fiber in its products and using only preferred materials such as organic cotton, hemp, recycled polyester, and recycled nylon by 2025. It is 87% of the way there.

“Since Fall 2019, (the company has) helped keep 14.6 million pounds of CO? out of the atmosphere when compared to their virgin counterparts,” says its environmental statement. “That’s like planting 109,000 tree seedlings.”

— switching to 100% reusable, home compostable, renewable, or easily recyclable packaging by 2025.

— achieving net zero across its entire business by 2025. To that end, it says that purchasing offsets — buying carbon credits to allow it to reach carbon neutrality, is not its default position. Rather, it says that 95% of its emissions are tied to its supply chain and materials manufacturing. That will be its focus.

Could you please explain how protecting public lands and waters fits your corporate mission and improve the Patagonia supply chain?

Protecting the nation’s public lands and waters is one of the company’s highest priorities. It says that 24% of all US-generated CO2 is the result of producing fossil fuels on federal lands and offshore waters. That’s why it zeroes-in on land and water.

Reach its net-zero goals is an urgent matter. Patagonia says that its supply chain — defined as getting its products from raw materials to finished gear for sale — makes up 97% of its carbon emissions. It aims to be carbon neutral by 2025. After that, it wants to be carbon positive, taking more CO2 out of the atmosphere than it puts into it. How?

— using only renewable or recycled materials in its products by 2025. In 2018, 52% of its materials by weight were renewable or recycled. And in 2019, it was 69%. It says 169,944 pounds of old Patagonia garments were responsibly recycled in 2021.

— reducing energy usage throughout its supply chain by deploying energy efficient technologies.

— expanding its use of organic agriculture for its apparel business and restoring topsoil — a tool that helps its reforestation efforts. Patagonia started pilot programs to promote organic cotton suppliers in India in 2018 and included 150 small farmers there.

— going fully renewable worldwide. Right now, 82% of the electricity use at its globally owned and operated facilities come from renewables. It aims to get to 100% this year. For example, it installed 679 Kilowatts of solar energy on farmland in Japan, while it produced 555,200-kilowatt hours from the solar arrays at its Ventura Campus. Meanwhile, it generated 3,900,000 kilowatt hours from the solar arrays at its Reno Distribution Center and office buildings.

Could you kindly tell us about your efforts to reduce waste?

In 2018, Patagonia rolled out a program to eliminate waste in its business operations.

“We are moving toward becoming a zero-waste-to-landfill organization through our own operations—which means all discards from our offices, distribution centers and stores will either have to be reused, recycled, donated, composted, or upcycled,” the sustainability statement says.

“To do so, we will have to change many of our operations, purchasing practices and behaviors to make sure anything leaving our footprint heads to a recycling or compost stream,” it continues. “With the current fluctuating state of recycling globally, this is becoming a more daunting task.”

It says recyclers no longer accept many items that used to be refurbished, mainly because much of it was comingled with trash and ended up in landfills anyway. While this makes the company’s goal more daunting, it has led to creative solutions.",['Ken Silverstein'],2022-10-07 11:12:09+00:00
https://explorersweb.com/two-climbers-die-in-patagonia-in-separate-incidents-over-the-holidays/,Two Climbers Die in Patagonia in Separate Incidents Over the Holidays,"The Patagonian climbing season has not started well. Two climbers have lost their lives so far in separate accidents, both related to bad weather.

A Swiss-German man died on December 19 in a fall on a glacier while retreating from a failed attempt on Aguja Standhart — sometimes also called Cerro Standhart — in the Cerro Torre massif. He and his partner aborted their climb on the granite spire because of rapidly worsening conditions. Shortly after starting down, he slipped while waking down a small glacier at the base of the peak and died instantly, AhoraCalafate reported.

The second occurred on Christmas Day, on Aguja Guillaumet. Twenty-five-year-old Cassy Doolittle of the U.S. was climbing solo when a sudden storm released freezing rain and high winds. She lost her way while rappelling from the summit.

Details are sketchy, but at some point, she was unable to proceed down any further. Doolittle sent an SOS via her InReach device, but rescuers who reached the area the following day couldn’t find her because of bad weather. A second search group finally located her body on Dec. 27, partially buried in snow. She had perished of hypothermia.

Colin Haley: don’t take Patagonia lightly

Colin Haley, currently climbing in the area, mentioned the casualties as “a sobering reminder to those traveling to El Chalten. These mountains are much more serious than anything in the Alps or the contiguous U.S., and shouldn’t be taken lightly, he warned.

Haley said the weather has been worse than average in Patagonia this season. Check the videos of a windy training day that he had in Loma Blanca three days ago:

Patagonia’s climbing season coincides with the austral summer. January and February are the busiest months.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewerskine/2022/10/05/how-will-the-patagonia-perpetual-purpose-trust-terms-be-enforced/,How Will the Patagonia Perpetual Purpose Trust Terms Be Enforced?,"Compliance Concepts on Chalkboard getty

The announcement that Yvon Chouinard has given control of his $3 billion apparel company, Patagonia, to a Perpetual Business Purpose Trust, has generated a great deal of discussion about Purpose Trusts. The discussion centers around how the purpose of the trust can be enforced.

Two general points about trusts. First, to be valid, a trust must have identifiable assets and ascertainable beneficiaries (for a private trust) or ascertainable assets and a valid charitable purpose (for a charitable trust). Second the only persons who can enforce the terms of the trust (other than the Grantor) are people with a vested interest in the trust, either the beneficiaries of a private trust or the Attorney General with jurisdiction over a charitable trust.

The exception to the requirement that private trust have beneficiaries is a private (non-charitable) Purpose Trust. Purpose Trusts have existed for decades, if not centuries, but only in very limited circumstances. The most common are the Perpetual Purpose Trusts that maintain something specific; a living thing (a pet); a piece of real estate (a cemetery); or a tangible asset (an art collection). There is a few Purpose Trusts which have successfully held private family businesses, but not many. The Trust may make distributions to individuals, such as the caretaker of a pet, the maintenance staff of the cemetery or the curator of the collection, but those individuals are not the beneficiaries of the trust. There may be an informal interest from friends, family and the community at large in the maintenance of the pet or the property such that, may be social and moral pressure to enforce the purpose of the trust, but no one has legal standing to sue enforce the Trust’s purpose.

The scope of a private Purpose Trust is only limited by the Purpose of the Grantor in creating the trust. The objectives of the Trustees are not limited if the objectives fit into the Purpose, even if those objectives are not the implicit objectives of the Grantor when creating the Trust. For example:

Grantor A creates a trust the purpose of which is to maintain family unity and good relations. One implicit objective of the Grantor might be to keep the family summer house initially transferred into the trust by Grantor A, but an equally valid objective might be to have the Trustees sell the property and by a summer house for each of the children of Grantor A as trying to share the use of one house actually harms the unity and good relations of the Family.

Grantor B creates a trust for the purpose of maintaining the Grantor’s art collection art which the family now enjoys having hanging in their homes. The implicit objective of the Grantor might be to keep the art in the family homes, but the Trustees could, if it is the best way to maintain the collection, loan the collection to the Metropolitan Art Museum so removing the art from the family homes.

In the Patagonia situation, Chouinard’s purpose is that the profits of Patagonia benefit the environment, for employees and the community. What happens if the Trustees decide that the most profitable thing to do is to sell the company and invest in oil and gas limited partnerships (some of which are now returning 50% or more in 2022) and increases the profits distributed to the Foundation from $100 million to $1 billion annually (at least for a short time). If Mr. Chouinard is not around to object, then who does have the right to object?

In most states, the Uniform Trust Act provides only a cursory handling of the issue of enforceability in purpose trusts. The Act requires a Board of Trustees, that controls the Trust assets, an Advisory Committee, who can sue to enforce the purpose of the Trust, and a Trust Protector that can amend and even terminate the Trust. It does not address what an appropriate role of the Grantor, the grantor’s family and other interested parties, such as the employees of the business held by the Purpose Trust might have. It also does not answer the question of enforceability. Professor Charles Rounds has raised this exact question in his Loring and Rounds: A Trustee's Handbook (2022) section 9.27:

“Would trust principles rather than agency principles constructively govern were such a private enforcer in the picture? If the enforcer is a true fiduciary, then the answer might well be yes. The problem, however, is that in the purpose-trust context the enforcer’s fiduciary duties would have to be owed externally to someone other than the “settlor,” otherwise we would have a redundancy. But to whom would they run? If the “enforcer” of a purpose trust effectively owes fiduciary duties to no one, then the enforcement mechanism is illusory; and, if the enforcement mechanism is illusory, so also is the Trust itself.”

There is no duty of loyalty running from the Trustees, Advisory Committee or Enforcer(s) of the Patagonia Purpose Trust to the private foundation, since the private foundation is not a beneficiary of the Trust. Is there a fiduciary duty running from the Trustees, as the controlling shareholder of the company, to the foundation, as a non-controlling shareholder? If so, can the foundation sue the Trustees to enforce the purpose of the Trust, or is it limited to sue only to those grounds that a non-controlling shareholder can sue a controlling shareholder in any corporation? Can the foundation, and so indirectly the Attorney General, sue to enforce restrictions on holding a closely held business interest in a charity?

In my opinion Estate Planners will have to do a lot more work on mapping out the specific scenarios that Patagonia Purpose Trust and the Private Foundation could possibly find themselves in in the future. They will also need to draft contingency plans if this structure later fails to either fulfill the Grantor’s purpose if the purpose trust, or the foundation, fails.

I doubt that many of the questions will be answered until the first big lawsuit. Until then, Purpose Trusts have worked in the past when the Purpose Trust, holds specifically identified real or tangible property for a clearly articulated purpose. This does not answer the questions raised by Professor Rounds, but there is some precedent on how the Courts may interpret the trust’s validity, and the enforcement of its purpose, in the future.","['Matthew Erskine', 'Amy Danise']",2022-10-05 00:00:00

CNN —

There’s just something about penguins – and for the scientists and conservationists who work with Patagonia’s flightless marine birds, it’s usually love at first sight.

Marine biologist Andrea Raya Rey decided on her career at age 10. As an animal lover who wanted to study the unique behaviors of creatures, she would find herself staring out at the sea for hours on end, watching dolphins frolic in the waves through her binoculars.

As an undergraduate student, she began studying dolphins in the wild and in the far south region of Argentina, she also found seabirds.

“When I met the penguins in person, I loved them,” said Rey, a researcher at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Tierra del Fuego. “And I can’t stop loving them.”

Marine biologist Andrea Raya Rey sits with gentoo penguins at Estancia Harberton in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. Santiago Cabral

Like dolphins, penguins are excellent divers and speedy swimmers. By studying the marine birds, Rey realized she could gain a better understanding of the ocean.

Along Patagonia’s edge at the southern tip of South America, different populations of penguins act as beacons for how ecosystems are responding to the climate crisis.

Penguins come on land to breed and nest, but they also spend a lot of time in the ocean, foraging for food.

Rey has studied their swimming behaviors, like where penguins go to forage and what they feed on, as well as the demographics of penguin populations. Together, this data creates parameters to help biologists understand how penguins are reacting to the changing environment around them.

“It’s the perfect animal to get to know the ocean better,” Rey said. “It’s like an early alert for how the ocean is suffering. All the marine environment threats are threats for penguins, too, like climate change, pollution, shipping, oil exploration and exploitation.”

Patagonia’s penguins

Patagonia is home to multiple types of penguins that live across the region’s diverse environments, including gentoo penguins, Magellanic penguins and king penguins.

Rey studies the 50 pairs of gentoo penguins that live on south Argentina’s Hammer Island, a harsh and remote place where the only residents are marine birds. She checks on the health of the birds and collects blood samples to make sure the population – considered stable for the time being – remains healthy.

Attaching a small camera to the back of each adult penguin allows Rey to learn more about how they feed when they depart on hours-long foraging trips. The penguins swim for miles and can dive down 200 feet (61 meters) or more during a single food-finding expedition.

Magellanic penguins populate Hammer Island as well as the beaches along Patagonia’s desert coast at El Pedral.

Pollution has been a threat to Magellanic penguins on the desert coast, but conservationists have worked hard to clean up the trash and create a protected area. These efforts allowed the colony to grow from six pairs of penguins to more than 3,000 pairs.

The king penguin is also making an unexpected comeback in Patagonia. Hundreds of thousands of king penguins had once lived in Tierra del Fuego, but European settlers hunted them, wiping out the colony.

King penguins are making a surprising comeback in Patagonia. The original colony had been eliminated by European settlers, who were hunting them for food. Axel Peterson

Then, in 2010, king penguins returned to the area. The colony grows and prospers under the watchful eye of local conservationists like Cecilia Durán, founder of the King Penguin Nature Reserve, who has built an enclosure around their breeding grounds and keeps visitors at a safe distance from the penguins.

Tracking populations

While some penguin colonies are growing, the largest ones are decreasing in Patagonia, Rey said. Closely monitoring different penguin groups can reveal if certain types of population interferes with other penguins that are pushed out of their typical environment, like the vulnerable southern rockhopper penguin.

Nest cameras allow researchers to track stressors for penguin colonies, like microplastic pollution or heat waves capable of killing penguin chicks.

If penguins disappear from Patagonia, it could cause a huge environmental shift because penguins are top predators in marine food webs and ecosystems, Rey said. Penguins help regulate these food webs, both on land and in the ocean, and their key role can’t be filled by another animal.

Rey studies the colonies by going to the remote environments where the penguins live in the far south. She wants the wild parts of Earth to remain wild. She hopes that humans can live in harmony with animals, rather than causing the stressors that can decrease their populations.

And there’s a kind of peace that comes from studying the penguins who live in isolated places that cars, smartphones and computers can’t reach.

“I really enjoy being in the middle of nowhere just with the penguins in these almost untouched places,” Rey said.",['Ashley Strickland'],2022-07-29 00:00:00
https://www.prnewsonline.com/patagonia-local-retail-climate/,Patagonia Owner’s Giveaway Can Make Climate Change a Local Issue,"Retail is a war. Retailers use every trick to grab your attention, keep you away from competitors and spend in their stores and on their sites.

For years, retailers relied on circulars, which were popular–and at times a nuisance, crammed into Sunday papers. They featured pretty pictures of products, marked down to get you to drop the paper and head to the mall.

Similarly, as PR pros in retail we used every trick to get media attention, whether it was midnight store openings at Toys “R” Us for Harry Potter or Richard Simmons entertaining Black Friday crowds for Macy’s. Each was planned as a mediagenic show stopper.

At some point, retailers went full-throttle on cause marketing programs, partnering with non-profits: Kmart with March of Dimes, Toys “R” Us with Autism Speaks, Macy’s with Make-a-Wish. The partnerships promoted non-profits and raised money for them.

The goals also included giving consumers a warm, fuzzy about the brand. After all, consumers are more likely to shop at a company that has a social conscience.

The Local Angle

Local representatives of the non-profits mixed with retail personnel. That was intentional. Part of the plan included media-training store managers and deploying them as local spokespeople.

After retail, I worked on a global campaign for climate change. The Nobel Prize-winning United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) employed me.

We media-trained more than 800 climate scientists around the world. The goals included sharpening messaging so they could communicate more effectively their massive climate reports in the run-up to the Paris Treaty Accords, in 2015.

One of the reasons it was so successful is because IPCC communicators applied the same tactics as retailers. They worked locally, developing local messages. That let scientists make climate change more relatable and personal, which was a winning strategy.

Coverage was extensive when the IPCC Working Group released its reports, in 2015. Articles ran globally and in our targeted 13 countries and cities. They became moments in time to stop and think about the ramifications of the biggest world threat.

Patagonia's 'Local' Giveaway

Last week, the retail world, climate community and the world in general got a genuine show stopper of mediagenic news. Patagonia CEO Yvon Chouinard dropped the announcement that he was giving the company to a trust dedicated to fighting the environmental crisis and defending nature. In effect, Chouinard launched the biggest cause marketing program in history.

So, why is this important, besides being altruistic?

First, Gen Z'ers, future shoppers whose attention is critical for retailers, are overwhelmingly engaged on climate change. Moreover, you can be sure this generation already knows about it since the announcement swarmed social media. There’s not a retailer on Earth that can match what Patagonia is doing for climate change. Also, there is simply no way to compare this initiative with anything else that has ever been done with such consequence in the world of retail PR. The company will remind in-store and online shoppers that every dime they spend on Patagonia merchandise will go to fight climate change. It’s why the Paul Newman brand became so successful. The company is going to be a leading, global activist for climate change in a way that is wholly relatable. Each of Patagonia's hundreds of global stores ultimately can become local climate change information centers. As brick and mortar look toward more experiential shopping, Patagonia stores now can teach customers about the danger of climate change and localize the messaging. This is a PR pro’s dream come true.

I loved working in retail and my climate change experience was very rewarding. When I talk about my career it's difficult for people to see a connection between working in retail and for a global climate effort. Now all I have to do is say, “It’s like working for Patagonia.”

""Instead of 'going public,' you could say we're 'going purpose,'"" Chouinard said in a statement announcing the move. ""Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we'll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth.""

Earlier this year, another businessman from a different side of the political spectrum – Chicago's Barry Seid – used a similar structure to donate his $1.6 billion business to a nonprofit that advocates for conservative causes, including restricting abortion access and appointing conservative judges to the federal bench, according to a report in the New York Times.

Seid was able to avoid paying taxes on the sale of his business, an electronics manufacturer called Tripp Lite, by donating it to the nonprofit Marble Freedom Trust. And he got to make sure his pet causes were cared for — much like Chouinard has done with the donation of Patagonia to his own nonprofits that he says will advocate for climate change.

It was a huge move, and it instantly lit up the business world. It also might give Chouinard and his family a big tax break, experts who monitor such big transactions told Insider.

That's because of the structure of the donation: Chouinard told the New York Times that the family's voting stock — about 2% of all shares — was being transferred to a new trust run by family members and advisers, called the Patagonia Purpose Trust. The rest of the privately owned company's stock, which the family now holds, will go to a new nonprofit called Holdfast Collective.

The Times reports that, in transferring that stock to the trust, the Chouinards are on the hook for $17.5 million in gift taxes. However, they're not going to pay any taxes on the value that stock has accrued since they first acquired it — what's called capital gains taxes. Bloomberg estimates that the capital gains tax on the donation could have come in at more than $700 million.

Similarly, the massive amounts of stock headed for the 501(c)(4) nonprofit are also tax-exempt. Justin Miller, national director of wealth planning at Evercore Wealth Management, estimates that if 98% of the $3 billion donated had been subject to a federal gift tax, it would have been as much as $1.176 billion with the 40% levy.

A Patagonia spokesperson told Insider the Chouinard family did not ask to create a company structure to avoid taxes.

""Patagonia pays its taxes,"" the spokesperson said. ""We have at times advocated for increased corporate tax rates to support climate initiatives. We did this most recently in our support of the Build Back Better plan – we said we would be willing to pay a higher corporate tax rate for stronger climate policies.""

Some experts say the structure Chouinard used to offload the company is helping the founding family of Patagonia ""opt out"" of the tax system the rest of us are subject to — or at least those of us who aren't billionaires.

The structure of the Chouinards' donations falls under a quirk of American tax law: Wealthy people don't pay taxes in the same way everyone else does

""You can give appreciated assets to a (c)(4) corporation and not have to pay any capital gains tax. And that's just the flaw,"" Chuck Collins, the director of the Program on Inequality and the Common Good at the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies, told Insider. ""Regardless of how generous the donor is, they shouldn't be able to entirely opt out of taxes. That's my view.""

There are a whole lot of mechanisms for the ultra-wealthy to move money around and not have to pay any levy on it. When it comes to why Chouinard isn't paying much in taxes, ""there's a simple legal answer — because he does not need to,"" Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, told Insider.

The structure of the donations means that the family won't get any charitable tax deduction, either, since they're pouring stocks into a 501(c)(4) and not a 501(c)(3). When you donate to a 501(c)(4), they're generally not eligible for a charitable tax deduction on your federal income tax — and, because of legislation signed into law under President Obama, those donations aren't subject to federal gift tax. Non-billionaires who claim donations on their taxes are probably donating into a 501(c)(3) in order to get deductions.

Miller said the choice of a 501(c)(4) instead of a 501(c)(3) makes sense: The family likely would not have been able to stay in control of a 501(c)(3). Russell James, director of graduate studies in personal financial planning at Texas Tech University, said that the ultra-wealthy generally ""can't even use charitable income tax deductions."" That's because they work to make sure that their on-paper income is low.

""They tend to have high wealth and low reportable income and deductions are limited to a percentage of income,"" James told Insider. ""So if they make a gift of even a small share of their wealth, it completely overwhelms their reportable income, meaning they are already maxed out on their donations that have tax benefits.""

In short, then, ""these alternate structures make more sense because you have more control, can spend it on politics, and you didn't really need the charitable tax deduction anyway,"" James said. Meanwhile, a 501(c)(4) can spend its money on political causes — like fighting climate change; a 501(c)(3) generally cannot.

Tax law means people can do the same for much less worthy reasons

While the Chouinards say they are are putting their billions towards fighting the climate crisis, other wealthy people can use the same type of structures for causes that are dear to them, too — and perhaps not so politically popular: Maybe an oil baron would want to use a similar structure to pump profits into supporting drilling for carbon.

""The argument for a change in tax policy to implement a gift tax for 501(c)(4)s is that not only can an individual donate unlimited — they can continue to grow tax free for generations,"" Miller said. ""So $3 billion today could easily be $9 billion 20 years from now. Completely free of taxes and all used for political purposes.""

Current tax policy ""allows individuals to not only influence politics during their lifetime but for generations after they are gone,"" Miller said. Ultimately, even if there's a ""good"" 501(c)(4) organization, ""there's nothing stopping anyone else from donating to a different organization you don't agree with — and these donations can have lasting effects.""

""I object to the tax rules in this area, because to me, it seems that the tax rules are subsidizing these political agendas,"" Rosenthal said. ""Everyone should be able to advance their political agendas as they see fit with their assets, but we should draft the tax rules in a way that forecloses benefits from using resources to advance an agenda.""

Notably, tax expert Harvey Bezozi said it's an unusual strategy, and probably won't become common. That's because, with the 501(c)(4) in play, there won't be an income tax deduction, and it's unlikely most families would want to use their funds more for political purposes than charitable ones.

But Chouinard's donations illustrate how the ultra-wealthy, even when championing big causes, fall out of the realm of taxation, which means that the public purse — the one that pays for roads and airports and healthcare subsidies — could be deprived of around a billion dollars in tax revenue, in Patagonia's case.

""We applaud this sort of charitable impulse and the desire,"" Collins said. Still, Collins said, ""some portion of that money should go to pay the taxes that the rest of us are paying on our income and assets.""","['Juliana Kaplan', 'Grace Kay']",2022-09-16 00:00:00

Patagonia’s billionaire founder has been praised for giving the company away to help fight climate change.

Yvon Chouinard, who founded the outdoor apparel brand almost 50 years ago, is transferring his family’s ownership to a charitable trust, making Earth the sole shareholder and beneficiary of any profits not reinvested back into the business.

It’s an extraordinary move from the 83-year-old, but not completely unheard of. In 2018 the CEO of Ecosia, the search engine that uses ad revenues to plant trees, also took action to ensure the company will only ever profit the planet.

“If we have any hope of a thriving planet 50 years from now, it demands all of us doing all we can with the resources we have,” said Chouinard, who has a net worth of $1.2 billion (€1.18bn), and became famous for alpine climbs in Yosemite National Park.

A rock climbing enthusiast, Yvon Chouinard started out making metal climbing spikes before moving into clothing and creating his hugely popular sportswear brand. Tom Frost

“Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth, we are using the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source.

""We’re making Earth our only shareholder. I am dead serious about saving this planet.”

What is Patagonia’s ‘radical’ new ownership structure?

The California-based company is “going purpose” rather than “going public” for its next half century.

Patagonia will continue to operate as a private, for-profit corporation but the Chouinard family, which controlled the company until last month, no longer owns it.

All the company's voting stock (2 per cent of the total stock) is being transferred to the newly created Patagonia Purpose Trust to give lasting ‘legal structure’ to the arrangement, and ensure there is no deviation from the founder’s purpose.

Meanwhile, non-voting stock has been given to the Holdfast Collective, another new entity and non-profit which will use every dollar it receives to “protect nature and biodiversity, support thriving communities and fight the environmental crisis.”

Patagonia projects that it will pay out an annual dividend of roughly $100 million (€100 million), depending on the health of the business.

The trust will be overseen by members of the family, but they will get no financial benefit from the new structure. In fact, the Chouinards will face a tax bill from the donation.

Can capitalism work for the planet?

It’s a virtually unprecedented move from a company of Patagonia’s stature, but not out of keeping with its longstanding environmental ethos.

The B-corp - with subsidiaries in food, books, surfboards and upcycled clothes - was a founding member of 1% for the planet, a group of businesses which contribute at least one per cent of their annual sales to environmental causes. It will continue to give this percentage to ‘grassroots activists’.

Employees were first to hear of the change at a global town hall event on 14 September. Soon after, the Patagonia website updated with the news that “Earth is now our only shareholder” and a signed letter from Chouinard.

“I believe this plan that he and his family helped create is tectonic. It will make the company more competitive and its employees around the world will forever be empowered by purpose,” says director Kristine McDivitt Tompkins.

Others from the board heralded the move as the “next model of capitalism”, echoing the company’s message as a for-profit business that capitalism can work for the planet.

“The current system of capitalism has made its gains at an enormous cost, including increasing inequality and widescale uncompensated environmental damage. The world is literally on fire,” said chair of the board Charles Conn.

“Patagonia has been breaking the mold for decades, and now they have shattered it. Now I want to know, which companies will be next to step up?” adds fellow director Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson.

Ecosia welcomes Patagonia to the “purpose-driven” club

The CEO and co-founder of Ecosia, Christian Kroll, welcomed the “fantastic news” from Patagonia.

Four years ago the search engine, which claims to have planted 157 million trees to date, became a steward-owned company. This means shares can’t be sold at a profit or owned by people outside the firm, and no profits can be taken out of the company.

“Every decision we have made since then is within the framework of regenerating the planet, rather than lining shareholder pockets, which has enabled us to plant millions of trees and invest in regeneration projects around the world,” says Kroll.

“We hope more businesses take this decision and that this sparks a sea change in how we all view success - that we should celebrate the people who are removing billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, not those who simply have billions in their bank account.”",[],2022-09-15 00:00:00
https://cbs4indy.com/news/infant-outfits-recalled-over-choking-hazard/,Infant outfits recalled over choking hazard,"VENTURA, Calif. — Knitted infant outfits are being recalled after a child got dangerously close to choking on a piece of the clothing.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission said the recall involves Patagonia Infant Capilene Midweight Base Layer Sets. The clothing was sold at Patagonia, REI and other stores nationwide and online from August 2021 through January 2023.

The recall was initiated because a snap on the shoulder of the bodysuit can detach, posing a choking hazard to the child. So far, the company is aware of one report of a snap detaching. The infant was found mouthing the snap, but the caregiver was able to take it away before the infant choked on it.

The recalled sets consist of a knitted polyester long-sleeved bodysuit with snaps at the left shoulder and at the crotch, and a pair of matching knitted polyester pants with an elastic waistband. They were sold in five designs with either style number STY60910FA21 or STY60910FA22 printed on the label.

https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mountain-glacier-chiles-patagonia-collapses-amid-high-temperatures-2022-09-13/,Mountain glacier in Chile's Patagonia collapses amid high temperatures,"













SANTIAGO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Higher temperatures and rainfall that weaken ice walls caused part of a hanging glacier to break off at a national park in Chile's Patagonia region in an event captured on video by tourists.

In a video that went viral Monday, a glacier that sits atop a mountain about 200 meters (656 feet) high rumbled and broke off at Queulat National Park, located more than 1,200 kilometers(746 miles) south of Chile's capital.

Detachments between masses of ice are normal, says University of Santiago climate scientist Raul Cordero, but he noted that the frequency of these events is troubling.

""Because this type of event is triggered by heat waves or by intense liquid precipitation events and both things are also happening more and more frequently throughout the planet, not only in Chile,"" Cordero said.

According to Cordero, there was a heat wave with ""very abnormal"" temperatures in that area of Patagonia before the collapse.

Cordero added that an ""atmospheric river"" consisting of relatively warm air laden with moisture was also recorded. When this ""river meets with Andean and Patagonian topography, it forms large clouds and discharges precipitation.

""One of the consequences of global warming is that it is destabilizing several glaciers and in particular some unstable glacier walls,"" said Cordero. ""That is the case of what happened in the last few days in Patagonia in a similar way to what happened a couple of months ago in both the Himalayas and the Alps.""

Scientists say sharp spikes in warming is linked to human-caused climate change and greenhouse emissions. The U.N. climate science panel earlier this year said governments and industries should drastically reduce fossil fuel emissions to contain warming and limit climate impacts. read more

https://theconversation.com/why-patagonias-purpose-driven-business-model-is-unlikely-to-spread-190889,Why Patagonia’s purpose-driven business model is unlikely to spread,"Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard, his wife, Malinda, and their two adult children no longer own the outdoor gear and apparel company. But based on my experience as a former executive who is now an adviser and lecturer focused on sustainability, I don’t expect many other U.S.-based companies to follow their lead.

Going forward, all of Patagonia’s profits, some US$100 million annually, will fund efforts to address climate change and advance wilderness preservation, the company announced on Sept. 14, 2022.

In a letter posted to the company’s site, Yvon Chouinard noted that “instead of going public” by selling Patagonia shares to investors, “you could say we’re ‘going purpose.’” The family has permanently transferred its ownership to a trust and a nonprofit.

By “purpose,” Chouinard means that the company’s profits will be used to protect the planet, as opposed to enriching shareholders. I see this choice as a valiant extension of Patagonia’s years of struggle to make capitalism more compatible with planetary sustainability. It also acknowledges the difficulty of trying to balance the interests of employees, customers and shareholders with the precarious state of the planet.

Urging customers to buy less

Chouinard stumbled into entrepreneurship as a “dirtbag” rock climber. Dissatisfied with the damage done to mountains by climbing equipment, he began to forge his own gear, initially doing all the work himself and then employing others. He remained a reluctant capitalist even as he founded Patagonia in 1973.

One example of this reluctance was a famous full-page ad his company ran in The New York Times on Black Friday in November 2011. Rather than lure shoppers with doorbuster sales and early opening hours, Patagonia implored its customers not to buy the company’s signature synthetic fleece jacket and to “buy less” of everything.

The ad lamented “the culture of consumption … [that] puts the economy of natural systems that support all life firmly in the red.”

Though Patagonia’s ad made a big splash, I didn’t find it surprising. Several years earlier I had visited Chouinard at Patagonia’s headquarters in Ventura, California.

At the time, I recall being wowed by the on-site day care center, the company’s pledge to donate 1% of its revenue to “the preservation and restoration of the natural environment” and the employees I witnessed heading out to surf in the middle of the day. In person, Chouinard seemed even more strident and less commercially motivated than I had imagined.

Perhaps ironically, given Patagonia’s seemingly anti-commercial posture, the company’s sales continued to grow, reaching more than an estimated $1 billion annually.

Seeing his name listed in Forbes’ exclusive list of the richest people made Chouinard recoil, saying “it really pissed me off.”

Timberland’s approach

At the time of that California visit, I was serving as the chief operating officer of Timberland, an outdoor footwear, apparel and accessories company. Like Patagonia, it was privately controlled at the time – it has since become part of VF Corporation, a publicly traded outdoor-focused conglomerate.

Timberland’s model blended “commerce and justice” by combining the pursuit of profit with respect for global human rights, support for community service and a commitment to environmental stewardship.

Timberland was one of the first companies in the world to issue a corporate social responsibility report, paid for all employees to perform 40 hours’ community service and was one of the last companies to continue to manufacture millions of shoes and boots in its own factories.

Patagonia and Timberland have both earned acclaim and awards for their creative attempts to demonstrate that business can serve not just shareholders but also employees, local communities and other stakeholders.

Business Roundtable

Chouinard’s choice to “go purpose” seems to be a more dramatic version of a historic declaration issued by the Business Roundtable in August 2019.

The group represents close to 200 chief executives, including the leaders of JPMorgan Chase, Apple, BlackRock and Walmart. Appearing to abandon its longstanding commitment to shareholder primacy, it recast the purpose of a corporation.

“We share a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders,” including suppliers, employees, communities and the environment,“ the group declared in what many observers saw as a shift to a more balanced and responsible form of capitalism.

In my view, however, current systems, structures and incentives ensure that revenue and profit growth remain sacrosanct for companies. As a result, calls by well-intentioned advocates for more focus on social or environmental issues remain no match for a model governed by the pressure to deliver short-term results.

So far, business as usual remains the norm.

Unlike Chouinard’s decision to allocate 100% of Patagonia’s profits to environmental causes, the Business Roundtable’s 2019 statement is nonbinding and doesn’t compel companies to do anything differently.

Research published in 2020 seems to confirm that the roundtable’s new statement of purpose was mostly performative. Since its release, close to 100 of the companies that belong to the group have updated their governance guidelines, but very few had ""made any changes to their statement of corporate purpose.”

In addition, the researchers examined 26 proposals that shareholders had introduced with the goal of implementing the roundtable’s statement. “Each company invariably opposed these proposals,” the study observed.

Rational executives

Chouinard’s remake of Patagonia’s governance acknowledges an important reality.

When presented with a situation in which social welfare and private profits align, companies will act sustainably. However, when circumstances pit public welfare against a company’s bottom line, executives typically side with their shareholders.

This does not make most executives evil; it makes them rational. They are responding to capitalism’s current system rules and incentives.

That’s why I find Chouinard’s imaginative act of moral courage uplifting.

At the same time, I believe that it would be naive and even harmful to expect many others to follow his example by voluntarily choosing a purpose other than the pursuit of profits.

Expecting businesses to do so would relieve government of its responsibility to set different rules to protect the environment and address climate change. I also agree with David Gelles, the New York Times reporter who broke the story about Patagonia’s new governance structure. As Gelles noted in a Vox interview, Chouinard’s family is “one of one.”",['Ken Pucker'],2022-09-26 12:29:54+00:00

Click on the image below to explore it in its full resolution.

Covering an area of around 673 000 sq km, Patagonia is split by Argentina and Chile. The region comprises the southern section of the Andes Mountains, with lakes, fjords, rainforests and glaciers in the west and deserts and tablelands to the east.

The island archipelago of Tierra del Fuego, located at the southern tip of Patagonia (the southernmost tip of the image), is shared by Argentina and Chile, with the eastern part of the main island belonging to Argentina and the southern point of the archipelago, which forms Cape Horn, belonging to Chile. The Strait of Magellan, named after the discoverer, lies between Tierra del Fuego and mainland Argentina.

Part of the Alberto de Agostini National Park can be seen in the bottom of the image. The park features a highly irregular coastline, which is deeply indented by fjords. Deemed a designated UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, the park has several tidewater glaciers and comprises the Gordon, Cook and Londonderry islands.

The Falkland Islands can be seen in the far-right of the image. The islands lie in the South Atlantic Ocean, around 600 km east of Patagonia. The Falklands comprise two main islands, West Falkland and East Falkland, which are separated by the Falkland Sound – a channel that averages around 20 km in width.

The swirling green and blue coloured areas are densely concentrated phytoplankton blooms. These microscopic organisms thrive in the cool, nutrient-rich waters between the coast of southern Argentina and the Falkland Islands. Nutrients carried by rivers promote phytoplankton growth, which may explain the plankton hugging the South American coastline in the image, as well as dust carried from Patagonia offshore which is then diffused on the ocean surface by strong westerly winds.

In spring and summer, populations of algae in the South Atlantic often explode into enormous blooms – which float with the meandering ocean currents.

Carrying a suite of cutting-edge instruments, Copernicus Sentinel-3 measures systematically Earth’s oceans, land, ice and atmosphere to monitor and understand large-scale global dynamics.

Sentinel-3 measures the temperature, colour and height of the sea surface as well as the thickness of sea ice, while over land maps land, provides indices of vegetation state and measures the height of rivers and lakes.

https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2022/09/billionaire-yvon-chouinard-patagonia-gift-climate-change/,"Meet Yvon Chouinard, the “Existential Dirtbag” Who Gave Patagonia Back to the Planet","This story was originally published by the Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The publication of a magazine article in 2017 “really, really pissed off” Yvon Chouinard, the mountain climber turned reluctant businessman and founder of outdoor clothing company Patagonia.

In the article, Forbes crowned Chouinard as a billionaire and added him to its list of the world’s richest people. While many people daydream of achieving a nine-zero fortune, for Chouinard it was a sign he had failed in his life’s mission to make the world a better and fairer place.

The Forbes article set him on a journey to find a way of giving away Patagonia, the company he founded almost 50 years ago with a mission to help fellow climbers. This week he achieved that aim, announcing that he was giving away all of the shares in Patagonia to a trust that will use future profits to “help fight” the climate crisis.

“Being a dirtbag is a matter of philosophy, not personal wealth. I’m an existential dirtbag.”

“Earth is now our only shareholder,” Chouinard, 83, said in a message to staff and customers. “Instead of ‘going public’, you could say we’re ‘going purpose’. Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth.”

Explaining his decision to give away the company, Chouinard told the New York Times: “I was in Forbes magazine listed as a billionaire, which really, really pissed me off. I don’t have $1 billion in the bank. I don’t drive Lexuses.”

Chouinard, who drives a beaten-up Subaru with a surfboard strapped to the roof, says he hopes giving away the company “will influence a new form of capitalism that doesn’t end up with a few rich people and a bunch of poor people”.

He is a businessperson, but very much by accident, and finds the descriptor offensive. He once told a journalist from Outside Magazine during a multi-day climbing trip up Mount Arrowhead, in Wyoming, that he would prefer to be referred to as a “dirtbag”.

Challenged by the reporter, who argued that you can’t be a multimillionaire and a dirtbag, Chouinard said he gave away all of this money and he doesn’t “even have a savings account”.

“But that’s not even the point,” Chouinard continued. “Being a dirtbag is a matter of philosophy, not personal wealth. I’m an existential dirtbag.”

Refusing to let it go, the reporter tried again saying Chouinard was a “very successful businessman” and “somewhere along the way you must have wanted to be a businessman.” Chouinard exploded back: “Never! All I ever wanted to be was a craftsman.”

And that is how he started. In 1957 he bought a second-hand coal-fired forge and set up a blacksmith shop in a chicken coop in his parents’ back yard in Burbank, California. He hand-made pitons—metal pegs or spikes driven into a rocks to support climbers’ ropes.

The pitons proved very popular with his friends and other climbers. It was also profitable as he could forge two pitons an hour and sell them for $1.50 each (the equivalent of about $16 today), giving Chouinard time and money to spend adventuring.

“I’d often climb for half a day at Stoney Point in Chatsworth, then go up to Rincon [to surf] the evening glass, [and] after I’d free-dive for lobsters and abalone on the coast between Zuma and the county line,” he wrote in his memoir Some Stories: Lessons from the Edge of Business and Sport. “I almost always got my limit of 10 lobsters and five abalone.”

Soon he figured out that he could pack up his blacksmith tools and take them with him as he surfed his way up and down the west of the US during the winter, and on climbing trips across the US and Canada in the summer. One year he spent weeks in the Rockies surviving on a case of 5¢ cans of tuna cat food mixed with oatmeal, potatoes, “ground squirrel, blue grouse, and porcupines assassinated à la Trotsky, with an ice axe.”

“We needed to be surrounded by friends who could dress whatever way they wanted, even be barefoot,”

Some years he spent more than 200 nights sleeping outside, and claims not to have owned a tent until he was almost 40. In 1962 he was arrested for riding a freight train in Arizona and spent 18 days in jail on a charge of “wandering around aimlessly with no apparent means of support”.

The idea of setting up a clothing business came about on a climbing trip. In Scotland in the winter of 1970, he bought a rugby shirt to wear while rock climbing as the thick collar kept his hardware slings, loaded with heavy equipment, from cutting into his neck. He kept wearing the top—which was azure blue with two red and one yellow stripes—when back in the US, and his climbing friends asked where they could get one.

He found out and started importing them, before expanding into other clothing and equipment for climbing. The company was originally called Chouinard Equipment, before he changed it after a transformative trip to Patagonia, in southern South America, to climb Mount Fitz Roy with his best friend, Doug Tompkins, the founder of rival outdoors company the North Face.

In another memoir, Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman, Chouinard wrote that if he “had to be a businessman” he was “going to do it on my own terms.”

“Work had to be enjoyable on a daily basis. We all had to come to work on the balls of our feet and go up the stairs two steps at a time. We needed to be surrounded by friends who could dress whatever way they wanted, even be barefoot,” he wrote.

Decades before the pandemic, flexible working was always the standard at Patagonia, which is headquartered in Ventura, California, because it is one of the world’s best surfing spots.

“We don’t care when you work, as long as the work gets done,” he said in a speech at the University of California, Los Angeles. “If you’re a serious surfer, you don’t go, ‘Hey let’s go surfing next Thursday at 2pm’—that’s what losers say.”

“You go surfing when there’s surf, you go powder skiing when there’s powder. We wanted to have a job where we would be allowed to do that. And we wanted to go work with friends—we didn’t want to work with MBAs,” he said. “We wanted to break the rules of business.”","['Rupert Neate', 'Fiona Harvey', 'Michael Mechanic', 'Madison Pauly', 'Stephanie Mencimer', 'Julia Lurie', 'Noah Lanard', 'Pema Levy', 'Lyric Aquino']",2022-09-17 09:00:43

It's an unusual route to take. But Chouinard wrote that if he'd sold Patagonia and donated the money, he wouldn't have been able to ensure the new owner maintained both its values and employees, while taking the company public would have been a ""disaster.""

Chouinard hasn't been afraid to mix things up during the 49 years since he launched Patagonia. The company prides itself on prioritizing employee wellbeing and sustainability over profits and has been a pioneer from the start.

""I wanted to distance myself as far as possible from those pasty-faced corpses in suits I saw in airline magazine ads,"" Chouinard wrote in his autobiography ""Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman.""

""If I had to be a businessman, I was going to do it on my own terms.""

""Breaking the rules and making my own system work are the creative part of management that is particularly satisfying for me,"" he added.

Staff can take time off to surf and nurse their babies

Since he founded the company, Chouinard has wanted staff to enjoy their jobs. From the start, he has let employees work flexible hours so they can surf when the waves are right, attend educational courses, or pick their kids up from school ""as long as the work gets done with no negative impacts on others.""

The policy has ""rarely"" been abused, Chouinard wrote.

After staff began bringing their young babies into its California headquarters, Patagonia opened a subsidized on-site childcare center in 1984, when there were only 120 others in the US, per the book. It has since expanded this to its distribution center in Nevada, too.

""We encourage our parents to interact with their child by breast-feeding, having lunch together, or visiting at any time,"" Chouinard wrote. ""The presence of children playing in the yard or having lunch with their mothers and fathers in the cafeteria helped keep the company atmosphere more familial than corporate.""

It also provides stipends for staff who don't have access to the on-site childcare centers and pays for caregivers to travel with an employee and their child on business trips.

Patagonia was also an early adopter of paid maternity and paternity leave.

Chouinard wrote in his book that the company also provides comprehensive health insurance, even to part-time employees, to attract athletic staff to work at the stores. In 1991, Chouinard started leading weeklong seminars where corporate employees would camp out together and learn about Patagonia's business and environmental values. The company told Insider it still takes staff on an annual ski trip.

Many of these staff benefits make business sense because they encourage productivity and attract higher-calibrate candidates, Chouinard wrote.

The policies are paying off. In 2020, Patagonia's then-CEO said that the company gets 9,000 applications for every open internship position and has ""really high retention.""

Patagonia gives 1% of its sales to environmental causes

Chouinard is an avid environmentalist, and he's brought these values to his company. Patagonia is a certified B Corporation, produced the first catalog printed on recycled paper in the US, and has been assessing its environmental impact for decades.

It was an early adopter of organic cotton and started making fleece jackets from recycled soda bottles in 1993. It also has a lifetime guarantee for its products and encourages customers to repair rather than replace them.

According to its website, all of the company's electricity usage in the US comes from renewable sources. The company also has a drive less program, which gives money to employees who commute by bike, carpool, or public transit and reserves the best spots in its parking lots for fuel-efficient cars, according to Chouinard's autobiography.

Staff can bring items from home into work for recycling, and in 1989, its Salt Lake City store turned part of its parking lot into Utah's first-ever recycling center, Chouinard wrote.

Patagonia also donates 1% of its sales to largely environmental causes, and Patagonia told Insider that it had given away $145 million in grants and in-kind donations since 1985 to mostly grassroots conservation activists and programs since 1985. In 2016, the retailer gave away all its Black Friday sales to grassroots environmental organizations.

""Our mission statement says nothing about making a profit,"" Chouinard wrote in his autobiography. ""In fact, our family considers our bottom line to be the amount of good that the business has accomplished over the year.""",['Grace Dean'],2022-09-22 00:00:00
https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/world/patagonia-behind-the-scenes-scn/index.html,Behind the scenes: Capturing Patagonia's wild species on camera,"The new docuseries “Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World” explores one of the wildest places on Earth. Catch the latest episode at 9 p.m. ET/PT Sunday on CNN.

CNN —

A lone male puma stalked through the tall grass of Chile’s Torres del Paine National Park, and it appeared to be heading straight for a film crew.

The crew, led by Chilean producer and director René Araneda, had secured a special permit to film pumas off of the park’s main trail. The team was waiting for another puma, affectionately dubbed Supermom, when an unknown male arrived.

Pumas don’t see humans as prey or even a threat – but it was crucial that the crew stood still and didn’t move, no matter how close the curious puma came.

The puma took in the small grouping of the film crew and moved on to the real reason he had arrived: stalking guanacos, a South American relative of the llama.

The tense moment passed, but it was just another day of dealing with unpredictable wildlife in Chile for Araneda and his crew. Once again, their knowledge and expertise protected them as well as the animals they were documenting for the CNN Original Series “Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World.”

“You have a script, you have an idea, you have shots that you want to go and do, but at the end of the day, when you work with wildlife, there’s a lot of improvisation on location,” Araneda told CNN. “It depends on what the wildlife allows you to do.”

Close encounters

Araneda remembers using a camcorder when he was 8 years old to capture footage of lizards and snakes, and recruiting his grandfather as a presenter. In addition to being a filmmaker, Araneda became a professional safari field guide when he lived in South Africa. That experience taught him to be respectful of the animals, how to read their natural behavior, and how to do things in a safe way.

Araneda has worked on a number of documentaries over the past 10 years involving Patagonia’s pumas. The cats are protected in Torres del Paine, and even the farmers who once hunted them as livestock predators now focus on protecting them. The male puma that Araneda’s team encountered is likely moving through the park because new biological corridors have opened in recent years, he said.

The park is a place where conservation biologists can study the pumas up close, witnessing their behaviors from 65 feet (20 meters) away in a way that might only be observed in camera traps in the United States.

“They allow you to see their secret lives,” Araneda said.

But at the end of the day, the park is the puma’s territory – a home to wild creatures where humans are the visitors. Araneda hopes that people respect wild places and keep their distance, rather than charging in with selfie sticks.

All of the crews who worked on CNN’s “Patagonia” docuseries secured specific permits from local park services and organizations like Chile’s National Forest Corporation, or CONAF, to film in certain locations as well as specific animals.

Being mindful of the animals and their space, as well as bringing in scientists and experts, allowed the crews to capture incredible moments.

Cinematographer Mauricio Handler dove underwater to film marine otters known as chungungos in Bahía Mansa, a quiet fishing village on the west coast of Chile. The otters were once on the brink of extinction, but they have rebounded in recent years.

What began as a challenging, freezing cold shoot became a “magical moment” for Handler as he captured footage of the otters playing.

Science in real time

Araneda remembers the first time he met biologist Isaí Madriz in 2019. Araneda was scouting locations for filming in South America and the two met by chance “in the middle of nowhere.”

Madriz had been conducting research in the field for weeks when he boarded the boat Araneda was on. They talked for hours, and at the end of their conversation, Araneda knew he wanted to work with Madriz on future projects.

“This is the kind of people that we wanted on the series,” Araneda said. “Passionate people doing things that no one else is doing and actually making a difference.”

Madriz has a reputation as “the bug detective,” and he’s known for finding new and rare insect species. In addition to sharing details about the glacier-dwelling stonefly known as the Patagonian ice dragon, Madriz also camped out in the tree canopy of Chile’s Valdivian forest to capture primitive crane flies.

“The biggest challenge is to put into everyone’s mind that a little ice dragon is the same or more important than a puma or a whale,” Araneda said. “It has the same value.”

An elusive species on camera

Scientists like Madriz and marine biologist Carla Christie shared valuable expertise and insights with the crews while working on the series.

Christie studies the Chilean dolphin, one of the smallest dolphins in the world that reaches a maximum of 5.2 feet (1.6 meters) in length. These diminutive dolphins, which bear rounded fins and snouts, are endemic to the Chilean coast, but they live in small groups because they are very specific about their habitat, Christie said. Scientists estimate that there are only a few thousand of these marine creatures.

And unlike other dolphins, Chilean dolphins are shy creatures that tend to stay away from boats and people.

The near threatened species is at risk of becoming entangled in fishing nets, habitat encroachment and noise pollution. Christie, the director of resources and public relations for Fundación Oceanósfera in Chile, wants to spread the word about the species because most people don’t even know it exists.

During filming, Christie was on a boat with director Kate Laurie.

“We already knew going into the story that it was probably going to be extremely difficult to find them,” Laurie said. “They’re very elusive.”

The dolphins appeared on the first day of filming as the boat sailed to the sheltered Guaitecas archipelago. The crew was ready with drones and underwater cameras to capture a species rarely seen on film.

Christie was able to see a female dolphin and her calf under the water, as well as mating behaviors using the drone overhead.

“It was an unforgettable experience,” Christie said. “I had the unique and important opportunity to tell the world about this little unknown dolphin from the end of the world.”",['Ashley Strickland'],2022-08-11 00:00:00
https://gearjunkie.com/travel/patagonia-black-hole-mlc-bag-review,"Patagonia Black Hole MLC Bag Review: An Organized, Carry-On-Size Wonder","The newest edition to Patagonia’s line of packs and luggage, the MLC Bag is a burly, soft-sided 45L convertible backpack suitcase with enough room and compartments for all kinds of travel.

Regardless of where I’m going or the duration of my travels, I try to always pack everything into a carry-on bag. Paying for checked bags is not my jam, and if you have everything with you, you can avoid waiting in baggage claim or items potentially getting lost in transit. Patagonia’s Black Hole line of bags and duffels has long been a go-to option for adventurers for years. But the newest in the Black Hole collection is the MLC Pack.

In short: The MLC is designed to keep you organized while on the move. This isn’t your standard, one-compartment duffel — it includes a variety of different internal compartments for storing your laptop and other essentials, and at 45 L, it meets most carry-on requirements. With three different carrying configurations, it’s also versatile enough for many types of travel.

Patagonia Black Hole MLC Pack Review

Multiple Ways to Travel

The MLC Bag (which stands for Maximum Legal Carry-on) is designed to allow you to travel any way you like. Three carrying configurations allow you to carry the bag as a backpack, shoulder bag, or duffel, or you can stow all the straps and simply carry the bag by the center handle.

My Take: Pros and Cons

I have always loved Patagonia due to its commitment to the planet and the fact that they make functional, durable, and well-made products. So, I fully expected to like this bag. But, it turned out that there were things that I both liked and disliked about this pack.

The fact that it converts from a suitcase to a backpack is my favorite feature, as hauling a heavy duffel bag around can be a challenge. The option to easily convert over to a backpack makes long walks through the airport or to bus stations a lot more comfortable, especially with the padded back panel and shoulder strap.

Packing up some gear into the Patagonia MLC; (photo/Rebecca Parsons)

I found the backpack style to be the most comfortable way to travel, but if you need to take your bag on and off frequently, the briefcase style is probably the move. I never found myself carrying the bag by the center handle, but I did appreciate the handle for hoisting the bag onto counters or into truck beds.

Something that I l have mixed feelings about are the multitude of compartments the suitcase has. I think dividing things up is great for staying organized, but it restricts the amount you can pack. That means this pack is a great option for a hybrid of work and adventure travel due to the padded laptop case, organizers, and additional room for gear.

But if you’re doing a gear-heavy outdoor trip, one of Patagonia’s traditional Black Hole duffels, where you can dump everything into one big compartment, may be a better bet— you’re able to fit a lot more.

The Nuts & Bolts

Fair Trade Certified sewn, the MLC 45L Pack uses recycled materials with a recycled TPU laminate. Patagonia designed the bag based on the maximum carry-on size of most airlines, making it free of wheels or handles that could snag or get in the way in transit.

The bag features multiple storage options, including a large main compartment with two interior organization pockets as well as a drop-in pocket for smaller items (see above). Additionally, the bag includes a dedicated space that works with most laptops (up to 19 inches) and has space for cords and other essentials. Designed specifically for airline travel, the laptop carrier zips open and lies flat, so you don’t have to worry about taking your laptop out of your bag, which saves a lot of time in TSA.

To make travel more comfortable, the MLC Pack includes a padded, stowable hip belt that takes the weight off the shoulders while in backpack mode. Many duffel bags incorporate a sternum strap of some kind but usually neglect a hip belt, so this feature is one that caught our attention. It also doubles as the shoulder strap when you transfer the bag to briefcase mode — two uses!

Should you prefer rolling through the airport, the bag has a wide webbing loop on the back panel that works to attach to rolling luggage. Or, simply use it as a carry handle/grab point. Patagonia thought of a whole lot of features here to make this bag airline travel-friendly while also retaining useful components for other types of travel.

Final Thoughts

Overall, this is a solid bag and a great addition to the Black Hole duffel collection. It’s well-made and durable enough to withstand rugged conditions. It’s comfortable to carry, with multiple carry options, and has plenty of compartments for easy organization.

If you’re a fan of the traditional Black Hole duffels but have been wanting more organization (or a backpack version), definitely check out the MLC.

This is a perfect pack for work or school travel and commuting due to the laptop compartment, internal storage spaces, and extra room for stashing clothes and/or gear. Next time I plan a work trip, I know which pack I’ll be reaching for.",['Rebecca Parsons'],2023-01-09 19:47:12+00:00
https://www.axios.com/2022/09/14/patagonia-changes-ownership-climate-change,"Patagonia founder gives away company, keeps climate change promise","Sep 14, 2022 - Economy & Business

Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard on Wednesday announced that he and his family are transferring 100% of the company’s stock to a specially designed trust and a nonprofit organization.

Why it matters: Changing ownership ensures the company will keep its independence and make sure all of its profits are used to combat climate change.

Driving the news: The Chouinard family said it has transferred 100% of its ownership to two new entities: Patagonia Purpose Trust and the Holdfast Collective.

The company told Axios in an emailed statement that ""every dollar that is not reinvested back into Patagonia will be distributed as dividends to protect the planet.""

Patagonia Purpose Trust, which holds all voting power in the company, will provide a legal structure to help keep the company's values in place, the company said.

""It will help ensure that there is never deviation from the intent of the founder and to facilitate what the company continues to do best: demonstrate as a for-profit business that capitalism can work for the planet,"" the company said.

The new Holdfast Collective, which doesn't hold any voting stock, will look to help protect nature and the climate.

Chouinard and the Chouinard family will remain on the board of Patagonia.

What they're saying: ""Instead of 'going public,' you could say we’re 'going purpose,'"" Chouinard wrote in a letter on the company's website.

""Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth.""

""As the business leader I never wanted to be, I am doing my part. Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth, we are using the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source.""

""We’re making Earth our only shareholder. I am dead serious about saving this planet.”

The bottom line: Patagonia considered, and rejected the idea of a sale or IPO, as none guaranteed that its values could be upheld.

""Truth be told, there were no good options available. So, we created our own.""

Chouinard chose this estate planning vehicle to fulfill a specific purpose, of course—fighting climate change and advocating for workers' well-being.

But he also structured the deal in such a way that while he will have to pay $17.5 million in gift taxes for the shares he transferred to the trust, he is not on the hook for $700 million in federal capital gains from the sale (based on Patagonia being worth $3 billion). And by not transferring the company—and his large fortune—to his heirs, he avoids the 40% U.S. estate and gift tax.

""I desire to preserve this place - I think that is as strong a bond as any two people can have."" NatGeo has revealed an official trailer for a documentary film called Wild Life, the latest from acclaimed filmmakers Jimmy Chin & Chai Vasarhelyi (of Meru, Free Solo, The Rescue). This first premiered at the 2022 Telluride Film Festival last year, and is also playing at SXSW this month before it opens in theaters this spring. Wild Life is a sweeping portrait of conservationists Kris & Doug Tompkins chronicling their fight to preserve one of the last truly wild places on earth. After falling in love, Kris and the outdoorsman and entrepreneur Doug Tompkins left behind the world of the massively successful outdoor brands they'd helped pioneer like Patagonia & The North Face, and turned their attention to a visionary effort to create National Parks in Chile and Argentina. The film spans decades of entrepreneurial and conservation work and serves as a stunning look into the unbelievable professional and personal highs & lows of Kristine's life. Shot all across the wilderness of Chile, in conjunction with archival footage, the film is ripe with lush cinematography and poignant moments. Wow I'm all about this! It looks absolutely gorgeous, as always from these filmmakers.

Official trailer (+ poster) for Jimmy Chin & Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi's doc Wild Life, from YouTube:

""Jimmy and Chai have honored Doug's and my life's work in a profound, moving way. I am grateful. I can only wish that Wild Life offers a semblance of hope and reminds anyone who sees it that whoever you are and wherever you live you can make a difference in this world. Our work at Tompkins Conservation — restoring the planet by creating parks on land and sea and rewilding — is constant and ongoing."" –Kristine Tompkins

Follows former Patagonia CEO and president / co-founder of Tompkins Consv., Kristine Tompkins, on an epic, decades-spanning love story as wild as the landscapes she has dedicated her life to protecting. After falling in love in midlife, Kris and outdoorsman and entrepreneur Doug Tompkins left behind the world of the massively successful outdoor brands they'd helped pioneer — Patagonia, The North Face and Esprit — and turned their attention to a visionary effort to create National Parks throughout Chile and Argentina. Wild Life chronicles their journey to effect the largest private land donation in history. The film also chronicles Kris and Doug's close relationship with Yvon Chouinard, the founder of Patagonia, and Kris’ time working in the early days of his climbing gear company, Chouinard Equipment, which quickly evolved into the conscious outdoor adventure brand that we know today as Patagonia. Visit natgeo.film.

Wild Life is directed by award-winning filmmakers Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, director of the documentary films Meru, Free Solo, The Rescue, and Return to Space previously. Produced by Anna Barnes, Bob Eisenhardt, Jimmy Chin, and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi. This is screening at the 2023 SXSW Film Festival this month. National Geographic will then release Wild Life in select US theaters (NY and DC at first) starting on April 14th, 2023 - with more cities to follow. It will show on the National Geographic Channel on May 25th and will also be streaming on Disney+ the next day. Anyone else want to watch this?",['Alex Billington'],2023-03-09 19:12:29+00:00
https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/sep/19/patagonia-owner-giving-away-company-for-climate-ch/,Patagonia owner giving away company for climate change avoids $700M tax hit,"Not everyone was impressed by Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard’s decision to transfer his ownership of the company to a climate change group.

After Mr. Chouinard received glowing reviews for his philanthropy, led by a New York Times exclusive headlined “Patagonia Founder Gives Away the Company to Fight Climate Change,” those crunching the numbers pointed out that the move offers considerable tax advantages.

“Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard has described his decision to give away the company as his last-ditch effort to do all he could to protect the planet, however, it’s also helping him skirt around $700 million of tax bills. Funny that!” tweeted Net Zero Watch.

Declaring that “Earth is now our only shareholder,” the billionaire moved 100% of his nonvoting shares to the Holdfast Collective, a newly formed nonprofit dedicated to fighting the “climate crisis,” and all of his family’s voting shares to the Patagonia Purpose Trust, which his family and its advisers control.

The deal’s structure puts Mr. Chouinard in a position to save an estimated $700 million in federal capital gains taxes had he sold the $3 billion outdoor gear-and-apparel giant, as well as allowing his heirs to avoid estate and gift taxes while keeping his family in control of the company, according to a Bloomberg analysis.

The details shook the hero-of-the-environment narrative that characterized the coverage of Wednesday’s announcement, as fossil-fuel supporters and media figures on the left and right called attention to the tax benefits.

ProPublica senior editor Jesse Eisinger tweeted that The New York Times’ “paean to the Patagonia [founders’] machinations was erroneous. It’s a massive tax avoidance scheme,” while National Review dinged the “socialist billionaire who’s getting a sweet tax deal.”

A Patagonia spokesperson defended the arrangement, noting that Mr. Chouinard would pay about $17.5 million in taxes on the shares transferred to the Patagonia Purpose Trust. Those voting shares represent 2% of his holdings, while the nonvoting shares comprise 98%.

“There are no estate or capital gains taxes because there are no generational gifts or death, and there was no sale,” the spokesperson said in an email. “There was never an ask from anyone in the Chouinard family that we create a structure to avoid taxes.”

As a 501©4 nonprofit, Holdfast can make unlimited political donations, although contributions to the group are not tax-deductible.

Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, called the climate narrative disingenuous.

“I’m all for paying as little taxes as possible, but let’s not pretend that this complex business arrangement is about saving the planet,” Mr. Pyle said. “It’s really about fueling Mr. Chouinard’s political causes while still retaining control of the company, and creating a tax shelter for his heirs in the process.”

He added that it was “also ironic because Patagonia products wouldn’t exist without oil and natural gas, which will most certainly be the target of this newly created political organization.”

Indeed, Patagonia has been long accused of hypocrisy for supporting anti-fracking activism even though the company’s product line is heavily dependent on nylon and polyester, both petroleum-based fibers.

Patagonia has responded by shifting to recycled fabrics. The company said it seeks to phase out “virgin petroleum-based fabrics and materials by 2025,” and in the fall 2022 product line, “only 1% of our entire material usage by weight includes virgin nylon.”

In its announcement, Patagonia said that annual profits not reinvested back into the business will be distributed “as a dividend to the Holdfast Collective to help fight the climate crisis,” resulting in an estimated annual dividend of about $100 million.

(See that September 2022 bookshelf feature here.)

And then Yvon Chouinard, the founder of the much larger Patagonia outdoor wear and gear company (valued at about $3 billion) of which Patagonia Books is a small part, announced his decision to give away the entire company: The recipient: the newly established nonprofit Holdfast Collective. The purpose, as Chouinard explained it to The New York Times: “to give away the maximum amount of money to people who are actively working on saving this planet.”

Based on that unprecedented act of charitable giving, YCC decided to take a closer look at the book program Chouinard instigated and nurtured.

The list of titles below complements YCC’s interview with Karla Olson, director of Patagonia Books. (See that feature article here.) It includes both the first title ever published by Patagonia Books, Yosemite in the Sixties, and its first-ever children’s book Better Than New, which was released in May. In between are examples of the different genres that established the Patagonia brand: outdoor sports memoirs and training guides, business/management spinoffs from those memoirs, “climate memoirs,” natural histories, and revitalized science/nature classics. Three of these titles had been included in previous YCC bookshelves.

As always, the descriptions of the titles are adapted from copy provided by the publisher. When two dates of publication are listed, the second is for the paperback edition.

Yosemite in the Sixties by Glen Denny (Patagonia Books 2007, 144 pages, $60.00)

The sheer granite walls of Yosemite Valley galvanized a dedicated group of rock climbers in the 1960s, who saw the nearly holdless, glacier-polished faces as the purest form of challenge. The awesome Half Dome and El Capitan were first climbed in the late 1950s, ushering in a new era of rock climbing later known as the golden age of Yosemite climbing. This austere, boulder-strewn campground became the epicenter of the climbing world, serving both as a launching pad and a refuge from them. Camp 4, in particular was recently recognized by the National Register of Historic Places. Glen Denny’s collection of rare black-and-white photographs, including intimate portraits of Yosemite’s big-wall pioneers during the early sixties, captures this formative time.

Gerry Lopez, one of the most revered surfers of all time brings readers a collection of stories of harrowing waves, epic wipeouts, and heroes encountered over a lifetime on the water. From growing up in Hawaii and finding the tube in the early days at Pipeline, to pioneering legendary spots like Uluwatu and G-Land, Surf Is Where You Find It preserves memories of surf eras gone by and commemorates those who helped shape the surfing world today. Originally published in 2008, more than 50,000 copies later, this re-launch is redesigned with new photos. Timed with the release of a new documentary, The Yin & Yang of Gerry Lopez, produced by equally legendary surfer and skateboarder Stacy Peralta, these 38 stories and hundreds of photos offer more Gerry than ever before.

Beyond the Mountain by Steve House (Patagonia Books 2009/2012, 288 pages, $17.95 paperback)

What does it take to be one of the world’s best high-altitude mountain climbers? A lot of fundraising; traveling in some of the world’s most dangerous countries; enduring cold bivouacs, searing lungs, and a cloudy mind when you can least afford one. In 2005, Steve and alpinist Vince Anderson pioneered a direct new route on the Rupal Face of 26,600-foot Nanga Parbat, which had never before been climbed in alpine style. It was the third ascent of the face, and the achievement earned Steve and Vince the first Piolet d”or (Golden Ice Axe) awarded to North Americans. Steve is a spellbinding storyteller in the tradition of Maurice Herzog and Lionel Terray. Beyond the Mountain is a gripping read destined to be a mountain classic.

Training for the New Alpinism: A Manual for the Climber as Athlete by Steve House and Scott Johnston (Patagonia Books 2104, 464 pages, $34.95 paperback)

Applying training practices from other endurance sports, House and Johnston demonstrate that following a carefully designed regimen is as effective for alpinism and leads to better performance.

Life Lived Wild: Adventures at the Edge of the Map by Rick Ridgeway (Patagonia Books 2021, 424 pages, $30.00)

Rick Ridgeway calculates that he’s spent over five years of his life sleeping in “small tents pitched in the world’s most remote regions.” Some of his adventures made news: the first American ascent of K2; the first traverse of Borneo; the first crossing on foot of a corner of Tibet so remote no outsider had ever seen it. But Rick also kept an eye out for the quiet surprises, like the butterflies he encounters at 23,000 feet on K2. What really comes alive in Life Lived Wild are his relationships with his fellow travelers, such as Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard, The North Face founder Doug Tompkins, and filmmaker Jimmy Chin. Rick treats them all with candor and straightforward tenderness. And through their commitments to protecting the wild places they shared, he discovers his own.

Swell: A Sailing Surfer’s Voyage of Awakening by Liz Clark (Patagonia Books 2018, 320 pages, $34.95)

Embarking on an adventure that most only fantasize about, she set sail from Santa Barbara, California, as captain of her 40-foot sailboat, In true stories overflowing with wild waves and constant challenges, at the whim of the weather, of relationships sweet and sour, and of nature’s colorful marvels, Liz captures her voyage in gripping detail. She shares tales of sailing in high seas, of solitude and surprises, of finding connection to the earth and commitment to living in harmony with it. More than ten years, 20,000 miles, and one cat later, she’s still out there.

Tracking Gobi Grizzlies: Surviving Beyond the Back of Beyond by Douglas Chadwick (Patagonia 2016, 286 pages, $24.95)

An adventure memoir and an environmental parable emerge from this portrait of a mysterious but critical species living in a seemingly desolate but actually widely diverse and threatened ecosystem. In the tradition of Douglas Chadwick’s best-selling book, The Wolverine Way, Tracking Gobi Grizzlies creates a portrait of these rarest of bears’ fight for survival in one of the toughest, most remote settings on Earth. He demonstrates why saving this endangered animal supports an entire ecosystem made up of hundreds of interconnected plants and animals, from desert roses to Asiatic lynx and wild double-humped camels, all adapting as best they can to the effects of climate change. A parable of environmental stewardship in a legendary realm.

Four-Fifths a Grizzly: A New Perspective on Nature that Just Might Save Us All, by Douglas Chadwick (Patagonia 2021, 256 pages, $27.95)

Veteran environmental writer Douglas Chadwick presents an engaging series of personal essays that argue for the amazing interconnectedness of nature, advocating that the path toward conservation begins with how we see our place in the world. Four-Fifths a Grizzly shows that human DNA is not all that different from any other creature. We have a surprisingly close relationship with grizzly bears, sharing 80 percent of our DNA, (versus 60 percent similar to salmon, 40 percent the same as many insects). At the same time, our bodies are teeming with organisms, separate from ourselves but upon which we depend for survival. In fun, accessible stories. Chadwick presents examples of successful recoveries of species and habitats, with the thought that “we really can save a whole lot in a hurry.”

Salmon: A Fish, the Earth and the History of Their Common Fate, by Mark Kurlansky (Patagonia Books 2020, 448 pages, $30.00)

Henry David Thoreau wrote, “‘Who hears the fishes when they cry?’ Maybe we need to go down to the river bank and try to listen.” In what he says is the most important book in his long and award-winning career, Mark Kurlansky – best-selling author of Cod, Salt, and The Big Oyster – employs his signature multi-century storytelling to chronicle the harrowing yet awe-inspiring life cycle of salmon. Kurlansky’s research shows that all over the world these fish, uniquely connected to both marine and terrestrial ecology, are a natural barometer for the health of the planet. With stunning historical and contemporary photographs and illustrations throughout, Kurlansky’s insightful conclusion is that the only way to save salmon is to save the planet and, at the same time, the only way to save the planet is to save the mighty, heroic salmon.

Waves and Beaches: The Powerful Dynamics of Sea and Coast by Willard Bascom & Kim McCoy (Patagonia Books 2021, 400 pages, $29.95)

This revision by Kim McCoy updates the book for the time of climate change. One of the most significant effects of global warming will be sea-level rise. What will this mean to waves and beaches, and what effects are we already seeing?

Providing extensive resources for the constant battle to preserve the shore, this Waves and Beaches is an essential handbook for climate scientists and ocean activists.

Better Than New: A Recycle Tale by Robert Broder and Lake Buckley (Patagonia Books 2022, 44 pages, $18.95)

“Will You Help Me?” Isidora and Julian, playing in the Chilean ocean, hear a plaintive cry — a sea lion is tangled in an abandoned fishing net. They free their ocean friend then consider what to do with the net. With the help of a nest-building bird, they recycle it into something useful again, something better than new. In fact, abandoned fishing nets can be collected and made into other things – like Patagonia’s classic baggy shorts. Presented in both English and Spanish, Better than New: A Recycle Tale is an inspiring story that presents children with a problem and shows how they can find a solution. And kids will think it super cool that they could wear old fishing nets! You can help the planet, they will learn, with the choices you make in what you wear.

The new structure will distribute every dollar not reinvested into the company as “dividends to protect the planet,” according to a press release.

The Patagonia Purpose Trust now owns all the voting stock of the retailer, which totals 2% of all Patagonia stock. The organization was created to provide a more permanent legal structure to enshrine Patagonia’s purpose and values. The company will “help ensure that there is never deviation from the intent of the founder and to facilitate what the company continues to do best: demonstrate as a for-profit business that capitalism can work for the planet.”

The Holdfast Collective will control all nonvoting stock and use every dollar received to “protect nature and biodiversity, support thriving communities and fight the environmental crisis.” Profits not reinvested in Patagonia will be distributed as a dividend to the Holdfast Collective to fund its actions. Patagonia expects the annual dividend to total approximately $100 million, depending on the health of the business.

Patagonia itself will remain a B Corp and continue to give 1% of annual sales to grassroots organizations. Ryan Gellert will remain CEO and the Chouinard family will continue to sit on Patagonia’s board, which also will remain unchanged. The Chouinard family also will guide the Patagonia Purpose Trust and guide the philanthropic work performed by the Holdfast Collective.

“It’s been a half-century since we began our experiment in responsible business,” said Chouinard in a statement. “If we have any hope of a thriving planet 50 years from now, it demands all of us doing all we can with the resources we have. As the business leader I never wanted to be, I am doing my part. Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth, we are using the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source. We’re making Earth our only shareholder. I am dead serious about saving this planet.”

Patagonia has put environmental stewardship at the forefront of its mission since its founding in 1973.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/business/dealbook/philanthropy-patagonia-billionaires-way-taxes.html,"Philanthropy, the Billionaires’ Way","Unlike Seid, Chouinard, his wife and two adult children expect to pay some taxes: $17.5 million in gift taxes after donating Patagonia’s voting shares — 2 percent of its overall shares — to a separate trust. But Madoff calculates that Yvon Chouinard and his wife would have paid more than $1 billion in estate and gift taxes if they simply left Patagonia to their heirs. And a standard sale would of course have generated a huge tax bill, even if some of it was offset by subsequent donations. (Worth noting: Their children already owned an undisclosed amount of stock, so the estate tax could have been less, and the Chouinards explored other potential transactions that would have been taxable.)

Also unlike Seid, who sold his company as part of his donation, the Chouinards will keep control of theirs, thanks to their oversight of the voting shares trust.

And it’s all about the estate and gift taxes. Both donations avoided capital gains taxes, though there were other ways of doing so. More notably, they avoid estate and gift taxes, which come in at 40 percent. Such donations can minimize the tax hit that billionaires would otherwise pay on huge gifts and inheritances. Donating to 501(c)(4) groups is entirely legal — and its usefulness in avoiding gift and estate taxes is growing in popularity across the political spectrum.

At this point, those taxes have “been so delegitimated that people don’t recognize them as a real tax,” Madoff said.

For his part, Yvon Chouinard told The Times he wanted to secure the future of both Patagonia and its contributions to environmental causes. He also, quite simply, didn’t want to remain a billionaire. “For us, this was the ideal solution,” he said.","['Andrew Ross Sorkin', 'Vivian Giang', 'Stephen Gandel', 'Bernhard Warner', 'Michael J.

Courtesy of CNN

With the debut this weekend of “Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World,” CNN will air a first-of-its-kind production for the network starting on Sunday, July 10. It’s a six-part wildlife documentary series, something CNN has never attempted before, and one that relied on crews across two countries and in five different habitats — as well as on underwater rigs, helicopters, drones, GoPros and time-lapse setups to capture the wildlife on land and underwater that make Patagonia’s one of the most breathtaking and singular natural ecosystems on the planet.

Narrated by “The Mandalorian’s” Pedro Pascal, the series was filmed over the course of a year. And, in keeping with its focus on the natural world and threats to it that include climate change, “Patagonia” was also a fully carbon negative production.

The six episodes kick off Sunday with “The Desert Coast,” with succeeding episodes airing weekly. For CNN, in the words of executive vice president Amy Entelis, this was an ambitious project that breaks new ground for the CNN Originals brand and takes the network “on a new journey into the longform nonfiction space.”

Pascal’s narration helps quickly sets the scene. “At the ends of the earth is a land of extremes. Home to spectacular wildlife.

“For centuries, people and animals have battled for supremacy. But now, enemies are becoming allies. Together, they face new challenges in a rapidly changing world.”

Viewers are treated to a rapid succession of sights from this more than 1,000-mile stretch of land through Chile (where Pascal was born) and Argentina. There are swooping, wide-angle shots of a verdant forest, of the white spray of a roaring waterfall, of barren land and blue sea. Eventually, drone footage of a pod of 6-ton Orca whales — skimming the surface of the ocean — becomes the center of attention.

Over the succeeding episodes, “Patagonia” introduces the fullness of a place at the edge of the world that’s wild, isolated, and pristine. It’s home to animals like condors, pumas, penguins, and where new species of insects, birds, and other animals are discovered each year. And the terrains here span forests, deserts, fjordlands, and more.

“With state-of-the-art cameras and help from local experts granting unprecedented access, this immersive docuseries showcases the wildlife, the scientists who study it, and the people of the region who have evolved to live in these varied habitats,” CNN announced about the series.

From ""Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World"" Courtesy of CNN

The CNN crew not only had access to scientists, fisherman, and members of local communities, but it also secured several “firsts” during filming. For example, CNN’s was the first wildlife crew to get footage of the rare Chilean dolphin, which is native to Patagonia. This was also the first crew to obtain footage of South America’s smallest cat, the rare kodkod — as well as the rare stone fly known as the Patagonian Ice Dragon.

In “The Desert Coast,” viewers will meet a shark hunter-turned-shark conservationist. Gargantuan elephant seals that look like creatures from the Star Wars cantina will battle each other for the chance to breed with nearby females. Tens of thousands of parrots are shown dodging the peregrine falcon, the fastest creature on earth. And viewers will watch orcas pull off a dangerous maneuver — beaching themselves — in order to catch their prey.

Where the series especially shines is in the smaller moments, in the sometimes messy clash of humanity with the natural world — an intermingling that, as we see throughout the series, results in conservationists and the like scrambling to save and document their fascinating corner of the planet.

“I’m so in love with these animals,” a conservationist named Mauricio tells the CNN crew at one point during Episode 1, a grin on his face, as he raves about burrowing parrots.

The birds, with their brilliant colors and penetrating eyes, are memorable enough in their own right. But Mauricio explains how, the more he studied them, the more it touched something inside him. It’s a recurring theme throughout this series, of local residents feeling a kinship with this land and its inhabitants.

“We are so similar,” he says of the birds. “They are very social. They love talking, communicating. And their relationships with others are really important.

Beaming, he continued: “I’m the same. I can’t live without my friends and family.”","['Andy Meek', 'Amy Danise', 'Senior Contributor']",2022-07-09 00:00:00

As the fashion industry explores new sustainable practices, retailers are finding ways to make going green more attractive for customers.

Although many are changing their shopping habits for fear of a recession, 57% of shoppers say they still want the fashion industry to become more sustainable, according to a Nosto survey.

Sustainably made clothes may cost more, but there are brands that offer easy — and even lucrative — ways to help the planet.

These 15 brands offer low or no-cost clothing repairs and incentives for recycling items.

Uniqlo

As part of the company's Re. Uniqlo project, shoppers can stop by the SoHo flagship store in New York City to have clothes fixed by an employee for $5 per repair. Services include button replacement, zipper repairs and mending holes, according to the company website.

If you just want to clear out some old Uniqlo gear, the brand also offers drop-off bins at participating locations. The incentive for recycling pre-loved clothes? Knowing you've done a good deed for the day.

Patagonia

Worn Wear is Patagonia's way of extending the life of its garments by allowing customers to trade in old clothes for store credit. Then, gently used clothes are sold at a steep discount depending on their condition.

You can either mail your clothes or find the closest Patagonia store to get credit toward future purchases.

The North Face

If you're visiting a North Face location any time soon, be sure to bring unwanted clothing and footwear. The brand offers a $10 reward toward a purchase worth $100 or more. Its Clothes The Loop Program is part of a partnership with non-profit Soles4Souls.

Levi's

The denim giant offers recycling in all of its store locations, but some Levi's location take the good deed a step further. Like Patagonia, Levi's SecondHand allows customers to trade in vintage and pre-worn denim for a gift card if the items are eligible for resale.

American Eagle Outfitters

American Eagle wants shoppers to drop off old jeans instead of throwing them out. Members of the Real Rewards program get $10 off their next pair of jeans just for bringing in an old pair to recycle.

According to the site, the old jeans are repurposed as part of a collaboration with Cotton's Blue Jeans Go Green, another recycling program.

Carter's

Babies are constantly growing out of their clothes, so Carter's partnered with TerraCycle to incentivize recycling apparel. Its Baby & Kid Clothing Free Recycling Program awards points, which can then be turned into discounts, to those who mail in unwanted baby clothes of any brand. Shipments of 15 or more pounds earn 25 points, but there's a limit of one package per month.

Gap

The retailer offers two options for keeping clothes out of landfills. Customers can pick up a Clean Out Kit from the nearest Gap location and fill it with any shoes and clothes they don't need. The items will be sold by ThredUP in exchange for Gap shopping credit.

If you'd rather just donate, the retailer offers that option too, through its partnership with Give Back Box.

H&M

Since 2013, H&M has operated its Garment Collecting program that allows customers to hand in unwanted clothes of any brand in exchange for a shopping voucher on their next purchase. In 2019, H&M launched a rental service in its Stockholm stores that allows shoppers to rent clothes from its Conscious Exclusive collections.

Madewell

Madewell's ""Preloved"" section of its website is a secondhand shop made possible through its partnership with ThredUP. The site — dubbed Madewell Forever — asks for all brands of ""gently used"" clothes to be sent to ThredUP in exchange for Madewell store credit.

Madewell also has a partnership with Cotton's Blue Jeans Go Green, in which customers can bring in pre-worn jeans that are transformed into housing insulation in exchange for $20 off a denim purchase.

Reformation

Reformation's clothes recycling program, RefRecycling, has operated since 2015. Through a partnership with SuperCircle, Reformation offers consumers store credit in return for their old Reformation clothes in any condition.

It offers these amounts for the following items:

Shoes: $25

Outerwear: $20

Denim: $15

Sweaters: $10

Active: $10

PacSun

Preloved by PacSun asks shoppers to trade in their old PacSun clothes for store credit. According the site, whatever can't be resold is donated. The program is made possible through a partnership with ThredUP.

REI

The Re/Supply program allows REI shoppers to purchase used gear or trade in their old gear for an REI gift card, according to the official site. However, items must meet eligibility requirements for the type of gear and its condition to be accepted.

Timberland

Workwear-turned-streetwear company entered the circular fashion game in 2022 with the launch of Timberloop. If you send in old Timberland items, you'll get 10% off your next purchase, the site says. Trade-ins will be refurbished and resold or broken down to make new Timberland products.

Arc'teryx

The ReGear program gives customers a gift card for 20% of the original price on items traded in for resale on the website. Like Uniqlo, the brand's SoHo location in New York City offers repairs in person for damaged gear. The online service is only available to clothes under warranty.

Lululemon

Lululemon's ""Like New"" section offers customers the option of gently used activewear at a cheaper price than the brand's new clothing. For those who want to trade in their pre-loved Lululemon gear, you'll receive store credit.",['Jordan Hart'],2022-11-27 00:00:00
https://theconversation.com/has-patagonia-defined-a-new-gold-standard-for-business-responsibility-191250,Has Patagonia defined a new gold standard for business responsibility?,"Patagonia’s founder Yvon Chouinard made headlines recently with the decision to give his family’s $3 billion company, and its future profits, to the fight against climate change. In his words, “Earth is now the company’s only shareholder.”

Climate policy advocates celebrated the decision. Each year, $100 million in company profits will go to the Holdfast Collective, a U.S. nonprofit working for climate action and policy advocacy. Its legal status as a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization allows it to directly lobby on U.S. climate policy.

Patagonia has always been a pathbreaker. Since 1985, the outdoor clothing company has donated one per cent of its sales to environmental causes. In 2002, it helped found the business alliance 1% for the Planet to inspire other companies to follow suit.

Patagonia has also shared product innovations, like its plant-based neoprene, with its competitors in hopes of accelerating more sustainable practices. Other initiatives include its certification as a B Corporation, certifying Patagonia as a company that is committed to the common good, and its used apparel marketplace Worn Wear.

But its recent decision is on another scale entirely. Could it help redefine the gold standard of business responsibility?

Profit vs. sustainability

Tensions between profits and the planet abound in business. Much management scholarship has focused on identifying win-win scenarios where profit and sustainability coincide, including getting eco-conscious consumers to pay more for sustainable products and saving costs by making operations more resource efficient.

In many instances, however, a win-win scenario is not an option. Companies then face tough choices about striking a balance between profit and sustainability.

Patagonia has long grappled with this trade-off, often in public and eye-catching ways. Its 2011 Black Friday ad implored customers not to buy its best-selling jacket due to its environmental impacts. (Ironically, the ad quadrupled the company’s sales). Patagonia continued this pattern in 2020 when it ran an ad in the New York Times about the need to tackle the climate crisis.

Chouinard mused in a 2013 blog post that “making things in a more responsible way is a good start, but in the end we will not have a ‘sustainable economy’ unless we consume less.” He also expressed the hope that “Patagonia can find a way to make decisions about growth based on being here for the next 200 years — and not damaging the planet further in the process.”

Foundation-owned companies

A major barrier for sustainable companies is the assumption of shareholder primacy — that managers must maximize profits on behalf of the company’s owners. Shareholder primacy is particularly pronounced in publicly listed corporations. This is a major reason why Chouinard avoided taking Patagonia public and put a purpose trust in charge instead.

A trust or foundation running a for-profit company is not a new idea. In Denmark, and other Northern European countries, foundation-owned companies like Carlsberg and Ikea are much more common. Studies show that the performance of foundation-owned companies is often on par with investor-owned companies.

Foundation-owned firms are rare in the U.S. Regulations introduced in 1969 to reel in the perceived power of foundations imposed a stiff tax on foundations that owned over 20 per cent of a for-profit company. But in 2018, the Philanthropic Enterprise Act removed these obstacles under specific conditions.

These legal changes set the stage for Patagonia’s model. Ownership of the company is divided to give the voting stock to the Patagonia Purpose Trust, while the non-voting stock (which receives the company’s annual profits) goes to the Holdfast Collective.

The perils of philanthro-capitalism

But this new model comes with potential risks. If it becomes widely adopted, it could be used as much to oppose progressive climate policy as to advance it. Dedicating profits to an organization that can advocate for political causes and candidates may be viewed as a new version of philanthro-capitalism where ultra-rich individuals donate money to advance the causes they care about.

The growing influence of philanthro-barons and private foundations as interest groups in U.S. politics could undermine democratic processes.

The influence of private money on U.S. politics has only accelerated since the 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court decision that struck down bans on private funding of election campaigns. It facilitated billions of dollars of spending by corporations and other outside groups in recent U.S. elections.

Companies purely dedicated to advocating for their political cause might further accelerate this arms race on both sides of the political spectrum.

A new model for responsibility?

Can Patagonia’s model truly solve the tension between profit and the planet? Could it become a new gold standard for business responsibility? This will depend on the balance between its environmental impacts and the social good created via its products and advocacy.

Patagonia’s next moves will determine the actual impact of Chouinard’s decision. Will Patagonia experience pressure to grow its profits to further fund the Holdfast Collective? How will the Purpose Trust interpret the company’s stated purpose of being “in business to save our home planet?”

The company acknowledges the new ownership model “is not an excuse to ignore the real tension we’ll continue to face between growth and the environmental impact of our operations.” For now, this recognition and transparency positions it as a clear model that raises the standard for how to think, talk and act about business responsibility.","['Graeme Auld', 'Janina Grabs']",2022-10-05 19:18:25+00:00

Etymology

The genus, Jakapil (Ja-Kapïl: shield bearer), comes from the ‘gananah iahish’, Puelchean or northern Tehuelchean language. The specific epithet, comprising kaniu (crest) and kura (stone), refers to the diagnostic ventral crest of the mandible, and comes from the Mapudungun language. These languages, currently spoken by more than 200,000 people, have been combined as a tribute to both of the coexisting native populations of North Patagonia, South America.

Holotype

MPCA-PV-630 is a partial skeleton of a subadult individual (see Supplementary Information) that preserves fragments of some cranial bones (premaxilla, maxilla and basisphenoid), approximately 15 partial teeth and fragments, a nearly complete left lower jaw plus an isolated surangular, 12 partial vertebral elements, a complete dorsal rib and fifteen rib fragments, a partial coracoid, a nearly complete left scapula, a partial right scapula, two partial humeri, a possible partial right ulna, a complete and a partial metacarpal bone, three ischial and two femoral fragments, the distal end of a right tibia, the proximal end of a right fibula, three pedal phalanges, and more than forty osteoderms.

Referred specimens

MPCA-PV-371, two partial conical osteoderms.

Locality and horizon

Upper beds of the Candeleros Formation, early Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian, ~ 94–97 My, see16, and references therein), locality of Cerro Policía, Río Negro Province, North Patagonia, Argentina (Suppl. Fig. 1).

Diagnosis

Jakapil differs from all other thyreophorans in having: a large, ventral crest on the posterior half of the lower jaw, which is composed of the dentary, the angular and the splenial (medially hidden by the crest); a dorsomedially directed process in the short retroarticular process; leaf-shaped tooth crowns with a prominent mesial edge on their labial surface; maxillary and dentary tooth crowns differ from each other in their apical contour, the former being pointed and strongly asymmetrical, and the latter slightly curved distally with a more rounded and less asymmetrical contour; elongated (articular surface almost or completely beyond the posterior centrum face) and slender (width of less than a half postzygapophyses length) postzygapophyses in dorsal vertebrae; a strongly reduced humerus relative to the femur (proximal humeral width smaller than distal femoral width, see Supplementary Information), with a deep proximal fossa distally delimited by a curved ridge; a very large fibula relative to the femur (anteroposterior length of the proximal end almost comparable to the distal width of the femur); flattened and thin disk-like postcranial osteoderms.

Summarized description

A detailed description of the holotype is provided in the Supplementary Information. Jakapil is a small thyreophoran dinosaur (the subadult holotype is estimated to have been less than 1.5 m in body length and to have weighed 4.5–7 kg; see Supplementary Information, femoral description), with several novelties for a thyreophoran dinosaur.

A short skull is suggested by the size of the skull and jaw bones, and the reduced number of dentary tooth positions (eleven), compared with most non-ankylosaurid thyreophorans28,29. The antorbital and mandibular fenestrae seem absent, as in ankylosaurs29 (Fig. 1a; the mandibular fenestra is also absent in Scelidosaurus10). Dentary and maxillary emarginations are present, as usual in ornithischians30 (Fig. 1a). The block-like basisphenoid is strongly similar to that of Scelidosaurus10, with Vidian canals opened posterodorsally to the basipterygoid processes, the basipterygoid processes lateroventrally projected (unlike the anteriorly directed processes of stegosaurs28 and ankylosaurs29), and a strong cultriform process (as in Lesothosaurus31, Thescelosaurus32 and probably Scelidosaurus10; Fig. 1b).

Jakapil also bears the first predentary bone (Fig. 2a–d) with a plesiomorphic shape in a thyreophoran. It is subtriangular and quite similar to that of Lesothosaurus31, and externally it is ornamented by sulci and foramina, suggesting the presence of a keratinous beak. A beak is also supported in the edentulous and subtly ornamented preserved part of the premaxilla, as in derived thyreophorans28,29. The posterior half of the short lower jaw (Fig. 2a–f) is strongly dorsoventrally expanded, resembling the general shape of the heterodontosaurid33 and basal ceratopsian jaws34. This expansion is composed of a well-developed coronoid eminence (Fig. 2a–d, ce; similar to that in the stegosaur Huayangosaurus35 and most ankylosaurs36) and a large ventral crest at the dentary-angular contact that is unique among thyreophorans (Fig. 2a–d,f, vmc; resembling that of some ceratopsians, see SI). The dentary symphysis is slightly spout-shaped, as in most ornithischians37. Anteriorly, the dentary oral margin is subhorizontal in lateral view (Fig. 2a–d, D), unlike the strongly downturned line of most thyreophorans30,37. There is no evidence of a mandibular osteoderm as occurs in Scelidosaurus and ankylosaurs10. A surangular tubercle (Fig. 2a, st) adjacent to the glenoid fossa seems anteriorly continued by a subtly developed subhorizontal inflection of the anterior lamina (Fig. 2e, hi), in the position of the surangular ridge (synapomorphy of Thyreophora37), though the first is poorly developed. The glenoid fossa is roughly aligned with the tooth row in lateral view (Fig. 2a–d). The short retroarticular process bears a dorsomedially directed process resembling that of several theropods (Fig. 2g, dmp; see Discussion). This process is absent in all other thyreophorans 9,10,35,36.

The tooth crowns are leaf-shaped as in basal ornithischian and thyreophorans10,28,29,38 (Fig. 3). The tooth crowns are swollen labially at their base and lack both cingulum and ornamentation, unlike those of derived eurypodans28,29, heterodontosaurids33 and most neornithischians30,32. The mesial edge of the labial surface in the maxillary and dentary tooth crowns is prominent as in Scelidosaurus10, and ends distally in a denticle-like structure in Jakapil (Fig. 3, me). This prominent edge delimits anteriorly the wear facets of the dentary teeth. A striking difference with respect to most thyreophorans is that the maxillary and dentary tooth crowns are quite different (see Supplementary Information). The maxillary teeth (Fig. 3a–d) show seven/eight mesial and four distal denticles, a vertical apical denticle, and a straighter mesial denticle row (resembling those of non-ankylosaurid and non-stegosaurid thyreophorans10,35,36). The dentary teeth (Fig. 3e–j) bear seven mesial and five/six distal denticles, and a distally curved apical-most denticle. Also, the mesial denticle row is lingually recurved, as in Huayangosaurus35. Large, high-angled wear facets are present (Fig. 3d,h,j; dwf and mwf).

The axial elements are similar to those of Scelidosaurus39 (Fig. 4). The posterior articular surface of an isolated cervical centrum is flattened and seems almost as wide as high. A large foramen is placed just posteroventral to the parapophysis. The dorsal centra are cylindrical and elongated, with subcircular articular surfaces, and are biconcave (Fig. 4c,e). The neural arch is low but the neural canal is larger (Fig. 4d,e, nc). A dorsal neurocentral suture is visible (Fig. 4c, ncs). The diapophyses are laterodorsally directed almost 40° from the horizontal (Fig. 4d, di), at a lower angle than in stegosaurs28 and most ankylosaurs29, unlike the horizontal processes of basal ornithischians38. The postzygapophyses are medially fused in a slender (width of less than a half postzygapophyses length) and strongly elongated posteriorly structure (Fig. 4b, poz; more than in some ankylosaurs, such as Euoplocephalus and Polacanthus; see40,41). An isolated mid-caudal vertebra shows an equidimensional centrum in lateral view, with concave, oval articular surfaces (Fig. 4g). Transverse processes are very small and button-like (Fig. 4g, tp). Postzygapophyses are medially fused and do not extend beyond the centrum edge (Fig. 4g, poz). Proximally, the cross-section of the dorsal ribs is T-shaped. The low curvature of the shaft suggests a wide torso, as occurs in Emausaurus42, Scelidosaurus39, and ankylosaurs29. Some rib fragments with expanded (though broken) posterior edges suggest the presence of intercostal bones (Fig. 4h, ebr), as in Scelidosaurus39, Huayangosaurus43,44, some ankylosaurids45 (and references therein) and some basal ornithopods46. Some ribs are distally expanded (Fig. 4i) like the anterior dorsal ribs of Scelidosaurus39 and Huayangosaurus43.

Girdle and limb bones (see also Suppl. Figs. 2, 3) are mostly broken and with boreholes (probably due to bioerosion) at their ends. The scapular blade (Fig. 4j, sb) is elongated and parallel-sided, without distal expansion, an overall shape that resembles that of several theropods47, contrasting the distally expanded condition in most ornithischians30. A straight and parallel sided scapular blade is common in ankylosaurids29,40. The proximal scapular plate with a high acromial process (Fig. 4j,k, ap) is stegosaurian-like, and the lateral acromial crest (Fig. 4j,k, ac) is developed as in Huayangosaurus43. A low distinct ridge rises posterior to the glenoid fossa and represents the insertion site for the muscle triceps longus caudalis, as occur in ankylosaurids 40. The incomplete coracoid (Fig. 4l) is much shorter than the scapula, unlike that of ankylosaurs29,40, which bear a large coracoid. The coracoid and the scapula are not fused. The partial humeri (Fig. 3m) are strongly reduced in size, with overall limb proportions resembling those of basal ornithischians3,38 and several theropods47. A possible proximal end of the ulna (Fig. 4n) resembles that of other basal ornithischians, though more strongly laterally compressed. The anterolateral process is present (Fig. 4n, alp), and the olecranon process seems absent or poorly developed, as in Scutellosaurus9 and Scelidosaurus39. The ischia are poorly preserved (Fig. 4s). The pubic peduncle is separated from the iliac articulation, unlike the continuous cup-shaped structure of most ankylosaurs29. The shaft of the ischium is straight and parallel-edged, as in Scutellosaurus9 and Scelidosaurus39, and distally tapers as in stegosaurs28. The preserved femoral pieces (Fig. 4p) resemble those of basal ornithischians38,39. The bases of both the broken anterior and fourth trochanters (Fig. 4p, at, ft) are large, suggesting large elements; the fourth trochanter is proximally placed on the femoral shaft (near the height of the base of the anterior trochanter); and the distal end of the femur is slightly curved posteriorly. The proximal end of the right fibula (Fig. 4q) is much larger than that of all other thyreophorans (compared with both the femoral and tibial distal ends) and bears a large anterior curved crest. The block-like non-ungual phalanges and a bluntly pointed hoof-like ungual (Fig. 4o, ph, uph) are similar to those of Scelidosaurus39.

At least five osteoderm types are preserved in the holotype of Jakapil. The cervical elements are composed of an external, low-crested scute (Fig. 4t, sc) over a fused, smooth bone base (Fig. 4t, bb), as in Scelidosaurus48 and several ankylosaurs2,49. A probable cervical element is also composed of a concave base of smooth bone fused to a high, asymmetrical osteoderm (Fig. 4t, aco). The bases of these dermal elements present strong rugosities at one edge, suggesting a sutural contact between (Fig. 4t, rug), as in Scelidosaurus48 and some ankylosaurs (such as Pinacosaurus and Scolosaurus40,49,50). Scute-like post-cervical osteoderms (Fig. 4u) are strongly flattened, disk-shaped, and suboval with a very low crest, resembling those of few ankylosaurs such as Gastonia and Gargoyleosaurus51 (‘body osteoderms’ sensu Kinneer et al.52; see also49). Only one scute shows a high triangular cross-section like those of Scelidosaurus48. Also present are a few conical, spike-like osteoderms with deep concave bases (Fig. 4v), and many flat, disk-shaped, minute (7–10 mm) ossicles without crests (Fig. 4w).

Phylogeny

The phylogenetic analysis using the matrix of Soto-Acuña et al.5 recovers Jakapil within Thyreophora, as the sister taxon of Ankylosauria (Fig. 5). The branch support for the basal thyreophorans is considerably lower than that obtained by Soto-Acuña et al.5, although the support of Stegosauria and some less inclusive eurypodan clades is slightly better (ceratopsians and pachycephalosaurs also show a lower support). The Jakapil autapomorphies in this analysis are: ventrally orientated basipterygoid processes (char. 134; shared with Agilisaurus, Hypsilophodon, Zalmoxes, Tenontosaurus, Dryosaurus, Liaoceratops, Yamaceratops, Leptoceratops, Bagaceratops and Protoceratops); lateral orientation of the basipterygoid process articular facet (char. 136; shared with Homalocephale, Prenocephale, Stegoceras and Yinlong); a straight dentary tooth row in lateral view (char. 166; shared with the ornithischians Lesothosaurus, Eocursor, Scutellosaurus, Pinacosaurus, Euoplocephalus, heterodontosaurids and neornithischians); the presence of a ventral flange on the dentary (char. 170; shared with Psittacosaurus, Yamaceratops and Protoceratops); a well-developed coronoid process (char. 174; shared with heterodontosaurids and neornithischians); a surangular length of more than 50% the mandibular length (char. 183; shared with Stegoceras, Psittacosaurus, Yinlong, Chaoyangsaurus and Hualianceratops); less than 15 dentary teeth (char. 204; shared with heterodontosaurids, Gasparinisaura, Hypsilophodon, Wannanosaurus, Tenontosaurus, Dryosaurus and ceratopsians); apicobasally tall and blade-like cheek teeth crowns (char. 205; shared with Laquintasaura, Psittacosaurus, Yinlong, Chaoyangsaurus and Hualianceratops). Alternative phylogenetic analyses using the data matrices of Maidment et al.4, Norman6 and Wiersma and Irmis8 recover Jakapil as the sister taxon of Eurypoda (Stegosauria + Ankylosauria) and as a basal ankylosaur, respectively (see Supplementary Information). Being recovered either as an ankylosauromorph or a stem-eurypodan, Jakapil is closely related to Scelidosaurus in all analyses. Detailed phylogenetic results and discussion are provided in the Supplementary Information.","['Riguetti', 'Facundo J.', 'Fundación De Historia Natural Félix De Azara', 'Centro De Ciencias Naturales Ambientales Y Antropológicas', 'Universidad Maimónides', 'Conicet', 'Buenos Aires', 'Apesteguía', 'Pereda-Suberbiola', 'Departamento De Geología']",

There’s rarely a good reason to cheer for a billionaire. But for Yvon Chouinard, it might be worth suspending that rule. Chouinard, founder of the outdoor apparel brand Patagonia — valued at $3 billion — has given his company away for the cause of protecting the Earth. Make sense of the news fast with our daily newsletter ArrowRight According to a remarkable statement released by Chouinard on Wednesday, titled “Earth is now our only shareholder,” 100 percent of Patagonia’s voting stock will be transferred to a trust created to protect the company’s values, and 100 percent of its nonvoting stock has gone to a nonprofit organization dedicated to combating climate change and protecting undeveloped land around the world. The Chouinard family (his wife and two adult children were involved in and supported the decision) will end up paying $17.5 million in gift taxes on their donation.

It’s an unusual move — exceptional, really. And the exception highlights an unhealthy reality of our wealth-obsessed, capitalist system: It often requires more intention and effort to give away money than to passively amass billions.

Follow Christine Emba 's opinions Follow

Why is unloading a fortune so unusual, in a country that has minted 50 new billionaires in the past year alone?

Structural forces, for one. Our economy allows firms to grow and accrue capital with fewer and fewer restrictions, and to extract huge profits. The small number of people who have equity in these companies see their wealth swell at near-exponential rates, often faster than they know how to spend it or give it away.

Liquidating stock or equity has its risks, too. Chouinard didn’t want to take Patagonia public because he knew the market doesn’t usually reward efforts to do the right thing. As he explained in his statement, “Even public companies with good intentions are under too much pressure to create short-term gain at the expense of long-term vitality and responsibility.”

In other words: Capitalism holds neither employees nor noble missions in high regard.

And of course, having money is nice. It provides ease, access, the experience of luxury. But even the most indulgent billionaire would have trouble spending down their fortune in a lifetime — or several lifetimes.

Yet these are, largely, secondary matters. The reason most of the ultrawealthy don’t give away their fortunes is because they simply don’t want to.

“The sad truth is that lots of really wealthy people are reluctant to let go of their wealth, even if they claim they aren’t,” Benjamin Soskis, a historian of philanthropy at the Urban Institute, told me. “Their identities are so tied up in their status as ‘wealthy people’ that it adds a weight, puts the brakes on the speed of their dispossession.”

Especially in the United States, which runs on a mythology of self-creation and individual achievement, money and status intertwine at a deep level. We mistakenly equate wealth with worth, assuming the more of it you have, the smarter and more special you must be. While we nominally celebrate generosity, we goggle at the Forbes billionaires list every year (which, yes, includes Jeff Bezos, owner of The Post).

Advertisement

“It’s no accident that the Giving Pledge” — Bill Gates and Warren Buffett’s much-lauded commitment to give the majority of their wealth to charitable causes — “doesn’t have a stricter sense of timeliness,” Soskis said.

And even if those billions have been accumulating basically without anyone’s help, we tend to assume that the rich have some innate expertise as to how that money might best be spent.

Chouinard and his family are unusual in their ability to ignore — or at least not to be controlled by — this insistent messaging. (Apparently, being on the Forbes list was in part what spurred Chouinard to offload his fortune: It “really, really pissed me off,” he told the New York Times.)

But we should be looking for ways to make the outliers the norm — to celebrate altruism and virtue as much as we do winning at capitalism.

The first step might simply be to publicly celebrate those who go above and beyond, who engage in real philanthropy within their lifetimes, rather than pushing it off into the future.

“Hopefully,” Chouinard told the Times, “this will influence a new form of capitalism that doesn’t end up with a few rich people and a bunch of poor people.”

For once, a billionaire is doing something worthy of our applause.

https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/charitable-planning-update-yvon-1524042/,Charitable Planning Update: Yvon Chouinard Donates Patagonia Stock to Two Nonprofits,"Many of our clients are charitably inclined, and incorporate charitable planning into their overall estate planning. This can be as simple as making gifts to charities during life or via specific bequests in a Will. In addition, clients create donor advised funds and family foundations. They also implement charitable remainder trusts and charitable lead trusts – usually for a specific purpose or expected tax benefit (ie, to generate a tax deduction in a year with unusually high income).

Some charitable planning is more esoteric. Paul Newman famously created Newman’s Own, a for-profit food business that is owned by a charity whose objective is “to nourish and transform the lives of children who face adversity.” Warren Buffett created the “Giving Pledge” – “a movement of philanthropists who commit to give the majority of their wealth to charitable causes…”

Recently, Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard joined this group of wealthy philanthropists with unique planning by giving his Patagonia stock to two nonprofit organizations. Chouinard gave the voting stock of Patagonia (2% overall) to the “Patagonia Purpose Trust,” a trust with a business purpose to protect the company’s mission and values. He gave the non-voting stock (representing 98% of the company’s value) to a new entity – the Holdfast Collective. The Holdfast Collective is structured as a 501(c)(4) organization known as a “social welfare organization,” which is not charitable in nature, but rather is permitted to engage in lobbying and other political activities (in this case, environmental causes and “thriving communities”). Patagonia is valued at approximately $3 billion, so this was a very substantial transfer of wealth.

Some takeaways from Chouinard’s unique planning: First, it is clear that there are not “standard,” “one size fits all,” or cookie-cutter solutions for clients. Families are all different, and their planning has to reflect that and be tailored to the particular client and situation. Chouinard’s plan helps further a main family objective to remain politically active and protect nature.

Second, tax benefits are important. In Chouinard’s plan, he will not receive an income tax charitable deduction for giving the Patagonia shares to the two nonprofits, since technically a business purpose trust and a 501(c)(4) organization are not “charitable” vehicles. Also, Chouinard did trigger a gift tax (estimated at $17.5 million) on the transfer of stock to the business purpose trust. On the other hand, Chouinard does not owe gift tax on the transfer to Holdfast Collective (the 501(c)(4) organization). He avoided the capital gains tax that would be triggered if he sold the company. And he removed the value of the Patagonia stock from his estate, saving an estimated $1.2 billion of estate tax (interestingly, a death transfer to a 501(c)(4) organization is subject to estate tax but a transfer during life is not subject to gift tax).

Third, many clients care about “legacy planning” as much as they do about tax planning. Advisors can do a better job covering this topic with clients. We generally are focused on trust structures, fiduciary choices, income and estate taxes. But we also should ask clients how they would like to implement planning with respect to family legacy, which can include letters of wishes, family-based charitable giving, and/or a “family purpose trust” established to ensure that funds are available for family legacy purposes. Yvon Chouinard’s “outside the box” planning with Patagonia underscores the importance of this interesting issue.",[],

CNN —

When things feel overwhelming, an escape into nature is just the ticket.

That’s what happened for the film crew and scientists who worked on the CNN docuseries “Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World” after the pandemic began.

“I think it kept us dreaming that we could go and actually do it,” Chilean director and producer René Araneda said.

For some members of the team, stepping into the wilds of Chile and Argentina was the first time they had left their homes in months. But nothing had changed for the diverse species that call the ice fields, mountains and forests home.

Mindful of their role as visitors, small film crews kept a respectful distance – and that’s when they captured cinematic magic.

Fantastic creatures

If you’ve been enjoying the breathtaking views of CNN’s “Patagonia” series, things were even wilder behind the scenes.

During filming in Chile’s Torres del Paine National Park, a curious male puma wandered extremely close as a crew was waiting for a well-known female puma called Supermom to appear. Pumas don’t see humans as prey, but the team kept still until the animal focused on some guanacos in the distance.

In sheltered waters off the Gulf of Corcovado, marine biologist Carla Christie witnessed elusive Chilean dolphins as they swam in front of her boat. Rare underwater footage shows affectionate moments between the shy dolphins, such as a female and her calf.

Across the universe

One of the brightest stars in our sky is having a tough time.

Betelgeuse, a red supergiant that looks like a ruby in the Orion constellation, suddenly began to dim in 2019 – an event that puzzled astronomers.

Now, data from the Hubble Space Telescope and other observatories has revealed the star experienced a massive eruption and lost a big chunk of its visible surface. Astronomers have never seen anything like it before.

Betelgeuse is on the slow road to recovery, and while its surface seems to be returning to normal, the star’s interior is “bouncing” as it struggles to rebuild.

Curiosities

A 2,300-year-old text that had perplexed scholars now has one less secret.

The Kao Gong Ji was written around 300 BC and is the oldest known technical encyclopedia. Inside are six chemistry formulas for mixing bronze and instructions for how to make items such as swords, bells, axes, knives and mirrors.

But researchers couldn’t decipher a linguistic riddle in the text for more than 100 years, namely the identity of two ingredients called “jin” and “xi.”

Thanks to a new chemical analysis of ancient coins, two scientists may have finally solved the mystery of the missing metals.

Wild kingdom

Make way for the wolves.

Researchers from across the United States have proposed sanctuary space dedicated to gray wolves and other animals such as beavers. The protected regions, across 11 Western states, would include Yellowstone National Park and the Northern and Southern Rockies.

The goal of this project, known as the Western Rewilding Network, is to create protected places for keystone species critical to ecosystems across the American West.

Gray wolves and beavers were once the victims of overhunting. Both animals make incredibly valuable contributions to their environments – which becomes even more apparent when they disappear.

Climate changed

The climate crisis is heating up at both ends of the globe.

The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the planet, according to new research. Heat-trapping emissions from burning fossil fuels cause this phenomenon, called Arctic amplification.

And a first-of-its-kind study on Antarctica from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has shown the world’s largest ice sheet is crumbling more rapidly than previously thought.

Meanwhile, a band of billionaires are on a treasure hunt in Greenland as ice melts – and their quest could provide a solution. Jeff Bezos, Michael Bloomberg and Bill Gates, among others, believe mineral deposits there are significant enough to power hundreds of millions of electric vehicles.

And the beneficiary isn't family -- his wife and two adult children gave up their ownership rights as well.

https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/22/world/patagonian-ice-dragon-scn/index.html,Rare Patagonian ice dragon lives on disappearing glaciers,"The new docuseries “Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World” explores one of the wildest places on Earth. Catch the latest episode at 9 p.m. ET/PT Sunday on CNN.

CNN —

A mysterious tiny dragon lives among the ice of the Andes Mountains in South America – and if you blink, you might just miss it.

The Patagonian ice dragon is an insect just over half an inch (1.3 centimeters) long and it lives on glaciers.

The Southern Patagonian Ice Field may serve as an impressive reserve of fresh water, but the rivers of ice are a difficult place to live. The dragón de la Patagonia, a type of stonefly, has adapted to survive in this frozen land.

The dragon is what scientists call an extremophile, or an organism that can live in extreme environments.

This stonefly is the only true insect that lives in Patagonia’s ice field, and its entire life cycle takes place on the ice. There are two known species of ice dragon, Andiperla morenensis and Andiperla willinki, but there could be more waiting to be found.

That’s the extent of what scientists know, biologist Isaí Madríz said. Everything else is the basis of hypothesis or speculation.

But there are more questions than answers about the ice dragon.

Tiny but mighty

Time may be running out for the ice dragon. The diminutive insect is endangered because the ice sheet it calls home is rapidly melting due to global warming.

Madríz is dead set on learning everything he can about the dragon, and sharing that knowledge with others, to better understand a rare creature that learned how to survive in an icy, barren landscape millions of years ago.

Madríz, often called the “bug detective,” has researched Patagonia’s biodiversity for years. In addition to being the world’s expert on the primitive crane fly, he investigates poorly understood lineages of insects.

The ice dragons live their entire life cycle on glaciers. CNN Original Series

During his regular expeditions to the ice field, Madríz began collecting observations of the ice dragon and sharing them with laboratories that study the species in Argentina and Chile.

“I’m facedown on the ice, inching along looking at the insects and following them,” he said. “It’s kind of like going back to when you’re a kid, looking at insects and just figuring out what they do.”

The bug detective

His sleuthing has paid off. So far, Madríz has been able to observe behaviors of these insects that can only be witnessed in the field.

He has seen ice dragon eggs up close – a rarity since young ice dragons have proven to be elusive.

“The amazing thing is, once you start looking into the eggs, it looks like a little tiny shrimp,” Madríz said. “You can see the entire organism already developed.”

By the time the female ice dragon lays the eggs, the baby insects are fully formed. Scientists don’t yet know how long they take to emerge from the eggs, but their invisible nature is now understood – it’s because young ice dragons are translucent. On the ice, they are impossible to see until they begin to grow and mature and their exoskeletons become darker.

Madríz also learned by accident that ice dragons can withstand another extreme.

In order to preserve and study specimens, scientists usually briefly boil them in water, which helps to maintain shape without the tissues collapsing.

Madríz dipped three ice dragons in boiling water for about 10 to 15 seconds and turned to do something else. When he returned, one of the ice dragons was crawling out of the dish.

“We’re going to find out that this species is a lot more interesting than what we thought about because you don’t go from freezing to boiling water and survive, with the exception of something like a tardigrade,” he said. Microscopic tardigrades have an ability to survive and even thrive in the most extreme environments.

Remaining questions

Madríz hopes that many answers about the ice dragon will be revealed within the next few years. He wants to uncover how these insects opted to make glaciers their homes, rather than water, and then adapted to a unique lifestyle.

Madríz and his fellow researchers are hard at work on uncovering the inner workings of the species, including how it survives in the ice field and what it eats.

There is currently speculation that the ice dragon’s blood contains glycerol, a natural antifreeze, but the amounts, and whether it keeps the insect’s blood from freezing, is unknown. Future research could tell the tale.

It’s possible that ice dragons feed on tiny algae on the ice. They may also eat other insects that live in nearby valleys and are blown over by wind, landing on the glaciers and dying. And ice dragons are known to feed on cryoconite, the fine powder on the ice made of microbes and other small particles. This windblown dust can land on glaciers and decrease their reflectivity, which can make it easier for them to melt.

The executive will start in early September and bring experience scaling an ethical apparel brand, the company said. Fisher will continue to play a central role in product design and brand development and will remain as the company’s board chair.

The appointment ends a near-year-long search for a new chief executive at the company, which Fisher founded in 1984. Williams will be charged with developing the brand’s strategy and operations following the pandemic. The brand generated revenue of $241 million in 2021, down from $393 million pre-pandemic in 2019, though profits have increased over that period, the company said.

While Fisher is the majority shareholder, the rest of the business has been employee-owned since 2006.

In the US, the company is not only known as a sustainability pioneer, but also for its unwavering minimalist style — a subtle, untrendy look not readily available elsewhere in the mass market. In culture, Eileen Fisher has been referenced everywhere from the HBO series Girls to online memes.

https://snowbrains.com/patagonias-founder-will-avoid-paying-700-million-in-taxes-with-legal-loophole/,Patagonia’s Founder Will Avoid Paying $700 Million in Taxes With Legal Loophole,"On September 14, Patagonia made headlines and shocked the outdoor industry when owner Yvon Chouinard announced that he was transferring 98% of the family-owned company, including all its non-voting stock, to a new nonprofit called Holdfast Collective. Made in the name of saving the planet, the donation hands the company off to an advocacy group with a mission to “fight the environmental crisis, protect nature, biodiversity, and support thriving communities.” As most of Patagonia’s shares will be transferred to a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, Chouinard will not have to pay taxes on the gift.

In the chess move of corporate maneuvering, the new structuring will allow Chouinard and his family to effectively maintain control of Patagonia, direct billions toward climate advocacy, and almost entirely avoid all taxes. Chouinard told the New York Times that the family’s voting stock, about 2% of all shares, was being transferred to a new trust called the Patagonia Purpose Trust to be run by family members and advisers. The rest of the privately owned company’s stock, which the family now holds, will go to Holdfast Collective.

Philanthropy, it’s the billionaire’s way

By donating a large chunk of the company, valued at $3 billion according to the New York Times, Chouinard joins a small but growing movement among the ultra-wealthy to use nonprofits to exercise political influence for years to come in what Choiunard called “reimagining capitalism.” Although Patagonia’s profits will be used to make the world a better place, the family made the move in a tax-advantaged way. This is a feature that many philanthropists take advantage of and can be pretty popular in the exclusive world of billionaires.

Quartz Business Media spoke to NYU law professor Daniel Hemel about Patagonia’s $3 billion corporate gift and how it is a convenient way to avoid taxes. Regarding the decision as an act of philanthropy, an act of tax avoidance, or something in the middle, Hemel said:

“The Chouinards are not claiming an income tax deduction in the same way that the 10% of Americans who itemize get a tax deduction when they give to charity. A lot of the big-time philanthropy— whether it’s going to a (c)(3) [a typical nonprofit charity] or a (c)(4)—that deduction matters only a bit in the big scheme of things because many philanthropists have already figured out ways to minimize their income tax liability. When Warren Buffett gives Berkshire Hathaway stock to the Gates Foundation, he’s able to deduct a bit of it, but his taxable income is so small relative to the amount he’s giving away that the deduction is almost trivial to him. What really matters is the fact that the Gates Foundation can then sell the stock tax-free. I don’t think what they’re doing is in any way tax evasion—it’s legitimate tax avoidance.”

During last week’s announcement, Chouinard said in his statement that the Patagonia Purpose Trust was “created to protect the company’s values” of preserving nature through business practice. The Holdfast Collective noted that “every dollar that is not reinvested back into Patagonia will be distributed as dividends to protect the planet.”

Ryan Gellert will continue to serve as Patagonia’s CEO, and the Chouinard family will remain on Patagonia’s board, updating its website to state that “Earth is now our only shareholder.” The private company already gives away 1% of sales yearly to environmental nonprofits. It will continue to operate as a Certified B-Corp Business, but it’s unclear if it will become more involved in politics.

There’s no doubting Chounard’s climate-centric activism, but was this pivot by the billionaire made to keep his gains in mind? Whatever you want to make of the move, it’s clear the structure of the Chouinards’ contribution falls under an idiosyncrasy of American tax law: Wealthy people don’t pay taxes in the same way everyone else does.",['Nick Deriso'],2022-09-21 10:03:01+00:00

The suit says that Gap's product could fool shoppers into thinking it's a Patagonia collaboration.

Patagonia is suing Gap, claiming the rival retailer ripped off the design of one of Patagonia's most well-known products.

The outdoors retailer says Gap's Arctic Fleece pullover for men and kids uses ""look-a-like"" design elements of Patagonia's Snap-T Fleece. The similarities could confuse shoppers, who may think the fleece is part of a collaboration with Patagonia, the company claimed in a suit filed this month in US District Court in Northern California.

The filing claims that Gap intentionally copied several elements of Patagonia's fleece, including the piping on the collar, cuffs, and waist; the snap pocket and matching snap placket rendered in contrasting colors to the fleece; and the rectangular logo placed above the pocket.

Gap's logo also bears a striking resemblance to Patagonia's mountain-range logo, Patagonia says.

""Not all consumers will 'zoom in,' either at point of sale or post-sale,"" Patagonia's suit reads. ""And even if consumers do zoom in, they are likely to believe this is one of Gap's many collaborations.""

Gap, Patagonia/Insider

Patagonia introduced the Snap-T Fleece in 1985, and by the late 1990s, several other brands were using fleece in their products, including L.L. Bean, Lands' End, and Gap, according to The New York Times. The product description for Gap's fleece pullover says that the product was ""pulled from our archive and redesigned for today,"" and though it's unclear when Gap's Arctic Fleece line was introduced, similar Gap products from the '80s and '90s are available to buy now on resale sites like Depop and Grailed.

Patagonia said in its suit that it had previously warned Gap that its designs violated Patagonia's trade dress, or the look and feel of a product, and that ""its adoption of designs and logos bearing even more similarity cannot have occurred by accident.""

Patagonia has requested a trial and is demanding the Gap hand over its entire inventory of fleeces and as well as profits from its sales of the product, plus damages.

A spokesperson for Gap told Insider that the company doesn't comment on pending litigation.

Patagonia's suit comes amid a challenging time for Gap, which is dealing with a surplus of inventory — the result of both disrupted supply chains and a shift in consumer demand — and the demise of its partnership with Kanye West's Yeezy. Gap pulled Yeezy products from its stores in October, and the company said during its third-quarter earnings this month that it sustained a $53 million write-down related to Yeezy Gap merchandise.",[],

Chouinard, his wife and two adult children are transferring all ownership in Patagonia, which is valued at $3 billion, to two newly created entities — Patagonia Purpose Trust and the Holdfast Collective — as part of an effort to step up its fight against the climate crisis. Notably, every dollar that is not reinvested back into Patagonia will be distributed as dividends to organizations and groups that are dedicated to protecting the planet.

“Instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors, we’ll use the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth,” Chouinard, who is 83, wrote in a letter to employees.

Under the new structure, Patagonia Purpose Trust now owns all the voting stock of the company. It has been created to protect the company’s values.

“It will help ensure that there is never deviation from the intent of the founder and to facilitate what the company continues to do best: demonstrate as a for-profit business that capitalism can work for the planet,” Patagonia stated.

One hundred percent of the nonvoting stock has been given to The Holdfast Collective, a nonprofit dedicated to fighting the environmental crisis and defending nature.The funding will come from Patagonia: Each year, the money it makes after reinvesting in its business will be distributed as a dividend to help fight the crisis. The company projects that it will pay out an annual dividend of roughly $100 million, depending on the health of the business.

“It’s been nearly 50 years since we began our experiment in responsible business, and we are just getting started,” Chouinard wrote. “If we have any hope of a thriving planet — much less a thriving business — 50 years from now, it is going to take all of us doing what we can with the resources we have. This is another way we’ve found to do our part.”

Chouinard’s relinquishment of his company reflects his lifelong love for — and commitment to — the environment. He co-founded the 1% for the Planet initiative some 20 years ago. More than 5,000 businesses have since signed on to commit 1% of annual sales to environmental causes. In 2018, the company’s purpose was rewritten as “We’re in business to save our home planet.""

Patagonia will remain a B Corp and continue to give one percent of sales each year to grassroots activists. The leadership of the company is not changing. Ryan Gellert will continue to serve as CEO and the Chouinard family will continue to sit on Patagonia’s board.

The family will also guide the company’s controlling shareholder, the Patagonia Purpose Trust, electing and overseeing Patagonia’s board of directors. They will also guide the philanthropic work performed by the Holdfast Collective.

""As the business leader, I never wanted to be, I am doing my part,"" Chouinard stated in a release. ""We're making Earth our only shareholder. I am dead serious about saving this planet.""

In his letter Chouinard said that he considered other ways to increase capital and put more money into fighting the climate crisis, including selling the company. But he couldn’t be sure a new owner would maintain Patagonia's values or keep its employees around the world employed.

He also mulled taking the company public, but ""what a disaster that would have been,"" he said.

""Even public companies with good intentions are under too much pressure to create short-term gain at the expense of long-term vitality and responsibilities,"" Chouinard wrote. ""Truth be told, there were no good options. So we created our own.""",[],

But how should such investments be made in humanity’s and the planet’s future?

As I and my colleagues argued in the World Scientists’ Warnings series of papers and action framework, our planetary and societal crises are just symptoms of overshoot, with relatively simple root-cause solutions: stabilising and reducing human numbers and appetites. Climate change, road rage, water insecurity and plastics pollution aren’t independent crises – we shouldn’t be fighting them as if they are.

Capitalism may incentivise scattershot approaches, but bold, unifying steps are needed in the vanishing time available. Five unifying global actions on biodiversity and climate change should shape environmental investments:

Stringent global ecosystem protection – especially carbon-rich systems, a very rapid end to logging, and strict proforestation (mature forest protection).

Rapid global ecosystem restoration, especially in areas shifting from carbon sinks to carbon sources like forests, savannahs and wetlands.

Rapid and equitability-focused post-growth economics. Our appetites and numbers overwhelm virtually every action taken for the good of people and planet.

Focused climate restoration – accelerated nature-based technology to remove greenhouse gases from our atmosphere – can buy time to transition our economy, politics and mindsets to a post-carbon future and a habitable planet for our children.

Explicit intergenerational and fair-start rights – such as those of Wales and other wellbeing economy governments – will require future generations’ and other species’ rights to be taken into account.

Patagonia’s actions are a powerful step to kickstart the transition of our broken civilisation and economy to a wiser, kinder, more sustainable future. Literally everything that we know and love is at stake.

CNN —

The monito del monte, an endearing mouselike creature that lives in the forests of Patagonia, races vertically up trees, covering a meter of bark per second, to feast on insects and summer fruits ripening high in the canopy.

But it’s the monito’s ability to slow down its bodily functions to survive the region’s harsh winters that has fascinated scientists, such as biologist Roberto Nespolo, a professor who studies animal metabolism at the Austral University of Chile.

Once the weather turns cold, the bug-eyed monito builds a mossy nest in a tree hollow. Cozying up with four to eight fellow monitos, it settles in for the winter. There, the tiny marsupial enters what Nespolo described as a deathlike torpor, and its heart rate drops from 200 beats per minute down to 2 or 3 beats per minute. In this inactive state, it conserves energy, only taking a breath every three minutes. Its blood stops circulating.

“I got interested (in the monito) because of the amazing capacity of this marsupial to reduce (its) metabolism and save about 95% of energy during torpor,” said Nespolo via email. His work is featured in the new CNN Original Series “Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World.”

“That’s what we measured … in the laboratory. Now we could replicate those measurement(s) in the wild, and found that this capacity is even greater. Monitos could hibernate at zero degrees (Celsius), without any harm to their tissues!”

Nespolo has made it his life’s work to understand how these diminutive creatures of South America’s southwestern tip pull off this feat, something that could help us better understand human metabolism and perhaps even help us come up with solutions for long-haul space travel. Space agencies say that if humans want to make it to Mars, figuring out how to induce hibernation in astronauts could be the best way to save mission costs, reduce the size of spacecraft and keep crew healthy.

“Natural hibernators have a number of physiological adaptations that permit them to almost stop metabolism, without injuries, and to wake up weeks later perfectly,” he said.

“So many colleagues are seeking to identify those mechanisms to be applied either for potential human hibernation, or also for medical applications such as organ preservation.”

Monitos (Dromiciops gliroides) hibernate together in a nest. Roberto F. Nespolo

The monito is a zoological curiosity in more ways than one.

Like kangaroos and koalas, it’s a marsupial that raises its young in pouches. However, the monito is more closely related to its Australian brethren than other marsupials, such as opossums, that live in the Americas – something that’s long puzzled scientists.

Scientists consider the two species of monito (Dromiciops gliroides and D. bozinovici) to essentially be living fossils – part of a lineage called Microbiotheria that’s ancestral to Australian and American marsupials, making them the sole living representative of an animal group long thought extinct.

As a “relict species,” the monito acts as a window into the past that can help scientists understand how they have survived for so long, Nespolo’s research has suggested.

The temperate forest habitat where the monito lives is shrinking, but Nespolo is confident that the tiny creature, whose direct ancestors once roamed Earth’s ancient supercontinent Gondwanaland, will continue to thrive.

“I’m hopeful for the monito because they’re very resilient. They are able to adapt to change as long as their habitat still exists,” Nespolo said in the CNN Original Series.",['Katie Hunt'],2022-08-05 00:00:00

CNN —

At the northern tip of Patagonia’s desert coast in Argentina, the skies above El Cóndor are filled with shifting clouds of chatty, colorful parrots.

The mountain’s crumbling sandstone cliffs are home to the largest parrot colony in the world, containing 37,000 nests.

The burrowing parrots are so named because they tunnel into the sandy cliffsides to build their nests. These tunnels can be up to 9.8 feet (about 3 meters) deep.

With green feathers and white rings around their eyes, burrowing parrots stand out in this barren landscape overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. When the birds fly, bright blue and red feathers flash in the sky.

El Cóndor’s cliffs serve as a nesting ground for a species that once appeared all over South America, but the burrowing parrot population is now declining.

The parrots’ food source in the Argentine Monte is disappearing more quickly than the Amazon rainforest. This vulnerable region of desert grasslands and shrubs, which the parrots prefer, has suffered from deforestation.

The burrowing parrots have to fly three hours away from their nests just to find seeds and berries to bring back to their chicks within the cliff nests. Each year, the birds must travel farther to find something to eat, and it’s estimated the adults fly up to 164 miles (264 kilometers) per day, according to scientists at Justus Liebig University Giessen in Germany.

Moreover, threats from humans and growing tourism in the area are making life harder for the parrots.

A sky full of birds

Argentine director Kevin Zaouali, who made the first episode of the “Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World” series that premieres Sunday on CNN, first saw the birds 10 years ago when he visited El Cóndor, entranced by “an entire sky covered by parrots.” Returning to the beach, he and his team had to remain patient, “waiting to see what the animals wanted to offer us.”

The parrots have distinctive white rings around their eyes and olive green plumage, with splashes of color underneath.

The film crew spent 20 days with the parrots, wanting to find special moments, Zaouali said. The team listened to the constant chatter of the highly social birds and observed other nuances of their behavior as well. Burrowing parrots are monogamous and mate for life – and they do everything together.

Zaouali said he was struck by “the way they look at each other and the way they touch each other. They’re always giving kisses to each other.”

Amid these glimpses of affection were moments fraught with tension.

Burrowing parrots are the prey of the peregrine falcon, the fastest bird on the planet. It can reach speeds of 240 miles per hour (386 kilometers per hour) when diving at its prey. At the site, the falcons moved so quickly that it was nearly impossible to capture their dives on camera.

Some fledgling chicks inside the nest grow curious as they wait for their parents to return from the feeding ground and fall to the bottom of the mountain if they lean out too far. Zaouali and his crew spent a day watching a chick painstakingly climb centimeter by centimeter back up to the nest after it fell out.

The sandstone cliffs pose other risks for the colony. The structures occasionally collapse, with massive blocks falling from the cliff face and killing the parrots dwelling inside. But the parrots return each year after spending winters in the north because they prefer the arid openness of the cliffs along the Atlantic coast.

Protecting parrots

The burrowing parrot is currently considered to be of “least concern,” according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species, but the species has been recognized as one that’s declining in population.

Due to their charm and color, burrowing parrots are exploited by the wildlife trade. They have also been hunted as pests who feed on crops. And because burrowing parrots are so picky about where they nest, they are easily disturbed if humans encroach on their space.

Burrowing parrots are incredibly loyal to one another and highly social.

Zaouali began filming and photographing animals 16 years ago, and he has already seen changes in the places he once visited as a child. He said he worries that “the land of adventure” could lose the largest parrot colony on Earth and other animals if protective measures aren’t taken for the vulnerable species that call Patagonia home.

“Patagonia is a very special place but also very, very fragile,” Zaouali said. “It’s unique and very wild, and while it seems very distant and pristine, if we don’t try to protect it, it will be like any other place full of pollution.”",['Ashley Strickland'],2022-07-08 00:00:00

That goes for the streamlined, no frills Tarak 20L Del Dia ($105) for climbing and backcountry skiing, and the do-it-all duffle-style Luzon 24L Del Dia pack ($80) that’s nice whether you’re hiking or stashing dirty clothes after a weekend; all the way up to the Allpa 35L ($195), with its removable hip belt and air-mesh back panel and padded inner compartments for clothes and laptops. With its lash points and hidden organizing pockets, that bag is versatile enough for a hut-to-hut adventure or a week in Manhattan. I’m also a sucker for fanny packs — er, hip packs — and the Kapai 3L Hip Pack, with its Everlasting Gobstopper color scheme and secure zip pockets and padded sleeves, is a fashion ‘yes’ even if you’re using it to hold your phone and keys at the kids’ soccer practice.

I love speaking with the passionate founders behind inspired brands I love, and here’s part of my conversation with Cotopaxi founder and CEO Davis Smith about a brand with social responsibility at its core. He grew up in Latin America, where his father did construction projects for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Davis used that time to camp and hike and fish for piranhas in the Amazon River. It also gave him some ideas on how to run an engaged company.

How does your background play into what you’re doing with Cotopaxi?

Davis Smith: The reason we started the brand was the “why” we had even before we knew what we'd sell, and I think that's pretty unique. Other brands, they first create the product and then perhaps find a way to have impact in some way. But for us, we knew that our purpose was to fight poverty. You know, 700 million people are living in poverty right now. Given my background and early life experiences, I needed to figure out what brand or business I could build that would allow me to be part of a movement to help address that. We’ve helped over 80,000 refugees and most of that is happening overseas. It's happening in countries, far away from here with people that we’ll never meet and that will likely never become customers. And so that's maybe the first thing that really sets it apart. The second thing is that I care deeply about taking care of the planet, and about being a responsible steward of our planet. That shapes everything about how we think about how we make our product. At Cotopaxi, 94 percent of our product is made of remnant or recycled or responsible materials. And we've committed to making that 100 percent by 2025.

What’s the story behind the splashy colors on your products?

Davis Smith: We’ve always had really bright, fun colors. But we introduced early on, in the Del Dia line, a collection of bags that are one-of-a-kind because we're using remnant material. They’re made with random colors put together but it kind of matches and looks great no matter what combination you see. Behind the scenes, the sewers at our factory were choosing colors they loved, and they told us it was the first time they had creative choice in what they were doing. They got to be part of the creative process, which was really fun and fulfilling for us. At first I wondered, would people even want this stuff? Or like, is the return rate gonna be higher? But the return rate was lower than we'd ever seen for any product ever.

If the fun colors of your gear is any indication, I’m guessing you prioritize fun in the Cotopaxi workplace. True?

Davis Smith: So true. Even during the pandemic, we had fun. Like, we started a virtual hike that we do every Friday morning at 9:00 AM. It's in everyone's calendar and you dial into Zoom, and wherever you're at, you can go on a walk around the block or go on a nearby trail. We'll even walk your dog at the park with you. We have someone in the team do what we call a “lifeline,” which is basically sharing their life story, in a few minutes, from childhood until today. Hearing these amazing stories, you get to know people at a new level. And it's become my favorite part of the week.

What's next? What's are you most looking forward to?

Davis Smith: We have some big things happening, including some new products and launches. But what’s making me happiest is that we just hired a company president named Damien Huang, who had been the CEO of Eddie Bauer, which is many times bigger than us. Before that he was an executive at Patagonia and at the North Face. He’s just an amazing people-focused leader who understands our mission. He came from immigrant parents. He did study abroad in Ecuador where the name Cotopaxi comes from. He is deeply connected to our purpose and is just incredibly talented.

Okay, last question’s tough. What’s your favorite Cotopaxi product? Go.

Davis Smith: Yeah. Wow. Okay. Let’s see. One? I’d say the Allpa Duffle ($140) is my favorite. It comes in three different sizes, and it's essentially a backpack that kind of unzips like a suitcase. What I love is that it's got a few unique features that I've never seen in another product, including a zipper at the very bottom of the bag zips all the way around. You have a place to stash dirty clothes or shoes. It's got straps to carry the bag on your back. It also just looks really cool.

But really? Just one product? Come on!

As paddling dreamlands go, Futaleufú, Chile, is hard to beat. But it can be hard for women there to break into the sport.

That was the case for Vanessa, who, despite her generational status as a local, was forced to start kayaking “sin apoyo,” or without support.

Vanessa eventually became an instructor for Chicas al Agua, an organization that seeks to get women out on the water — specifically, the Rio Futaleufú.

It’s one of the most famous rivers on Earth among paddlers. Five seconds of watching this video will show you why.

Watch Vanessa and her cohort lead the women of Chicas al Agua in this documentary from Northwest River Supplies. And take a “lesson” or two with you.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13252-8,Transient ice loss in the Patagonia Icefields during the 2015–2016 El Niño event,"We model the observed vertical displacement change (obtained after removing any reference frame components, long-term ice loss, GIA, etc.) at each CGPS site as

$$d_{U} = d_{GLDAS} + d_{Lakes} + d_{Ice}$$ (1)

where \(d_{U}\) is the observed vertical displacement change at the CGPS station, \(d_{GLDAS}\) is the TWS loading vertical displacement, \(d_{Lakes}\) is the lake stage-induced loading vertical displacement, and \(d_{Ice}\) is the loading vertical displacement due to non-steady and non-seasonal ice changes. Therefore, the \(d_{GLDAS}\) and \(d_{Lakes}\) components are also detrended using the same parametric trajectory model used to detrend \(d_{U}\) (linear, seasonal, etc.). Using the 0.25 × 0.25 degree GLDAS Catchment Land Surface Model (version 2.0) TWS, PREM31, and the elastic response to a disk load (using 5 km diameter disks), we computed the vertical displacement of the crust produced by the regional changes in TWS at the seven CGPS stations between 2010 and 2019. Because GLDAS does not correctly account for ice fields and water bodies, we removed the model cells within these areas. Using the same elastic disk load and elastic models, we computed the water storage change signal for the lakes in Patagonia using lake stage observations (obtained from the Argentine National System of Hydrological Information, see http://bdhi.hidricosargentina.gob.ar/). Thus, the ice load signal can be found from Eq. (1) as

$$d_{Ice} = d_{U} - \left( {d_{GLDAS} + d_{Lakes} } \right)$$ (2)

The \(d_{GLDAS}\)+\(d_{Lakes}\) time series residuals (hereafter, GLDAS + L) in Fig. 2 also show departures from the nominal GLDAS + L behavior estimated between 2010 and 2016. Figure 2 shows the same time series as in Fig. 1e–g together with the detrended GLDAS + L time series. Before 2016, both time series show the same approximate behavior with no clear offset between them. Nevertheless, a clear offset of ~ 5–8 mm is visible between the GLDAS + L and the CGPS residual time series after 2016. In some cases, offsets of ~ 10 mm can be observed, especially after 2018. These offsets are above the observed standard deviation between the smoothed CGPS signals and the GLDAS + L signal, which is ~ ± 2 mm (Fig. 2, shaded area shows the 2.5 sigma region).

As previously discussed, the GLDAS + L time series do not include any loading effects due to changes in ice mass. Thus, the ice loss can be estimated from Eq. (2), hereafter CGPS-GLDAS-L. We discretized the NPIF and SPIF using 1 km diameter disks to find the ice loading signal using the CGPS data. To account for the spatial variation of ice loss, the elastic response of the disks (at each CGPS station) was calculated using the rate of change of the ice surface height (dh/dt) grids for NPIF and SPIF from Braun et al.19. Although the spatial distribution of dh/dt rates in the PIF during the 2015–2016 EN are likely to show differences relative to the average dh/dt rates reported by Braun et al., we will use this pattern as a more reasonable estimate of the spatial variation for ice loss during the 2015–2016 El Niño than a uniform one, and scale it to match the CGPS data. In either case, the total ice mass loss is controlled by the CGPS data, not the ice mass loss distribution. The elastic response of each disk-station pair can be converted from rate, dh/dt, to a height change by multiplying the rate by a time interval, Δt. It should be noted that if one knows the ice height change, the disk loading least-squares problem can be interpreted as a solution for the density of the disks, rather than the equivalent water height, that generates the observed CGPS displacements. The dh/dt grids, however, represent the average ice height change in the data used by Braun et al., and these values are not representative of the ice loss during the 2015–2016 EN. We can assume, however, that scaling the dh/dt rates by a factor (one for NPIF and another for SPIF) will bring them into agreement with the ice loss during this EN event. In other words, we wish to transform the average dh/dt values into an ‘instantaneous’ ice loss that fits the CGPS data during the 2015–2016 EN. Therefore, the loading problem presented here consists of estimating the appropriate Δt scaling factor for each field such that the densities estimated from the elastic response (at the CGPS stations) are within the known range of ice density. This Δt scaling factor gives the ratio of ice loss rate during 2015–2016 EN with respect to that obtained by Braun et al.

The mass balance problem was solved using three distinct approaches to characterizing ice density variation in the PIF. This diversity of approach helps us to assess the robustness of our conclusions. In the first approach, hereafter model A, we assume that density is a linear function of height, assuming an ice density of 918 and 500 kg/m3 at the lowest and highest elevations of the PIF, respectively. The second and third approach, models B and C, categorized the disks into two and three groups, respectively, based on elevation, ice velocity, and dh/dt values. The elevation of each disk was obtained using 30 m SRTM data, and the ice velocities were obtained from the NASA Regional Glacier and Ice Sheet Surface Velocities retrieved from the ITS_LIVE project18.

The classification into groups was determined using a height threshold (HT, varying from ~ 1000 to 1300 m) following Bravo et al.32 and Schaefer et al.33, a velocity threshold (VT, set at 30 cm/day), and the dh/dt value for each disk (negative/positive for height loss/gain). Disks were classified as group 1 (G1, lowest density) when dh/dt > 0 (except when velocity > VT, e.g. on Glaciar Pío XI, see13), as group 2 (G2, mid density) when dh/dt < 0, and velocity < VT or height > HT, and group 3 (G3, highest density) when height < HT and dh/dt < 0. We combined G1 and G2 to simplify the problem (model B) and we used the three groups for model C. For all three models, we solved for disk densities using the average CGPS-GLDAS-L difference after 2016.5. Observations were weighed in the least-squares adjustment using the squared inverse of each CGPS-GLDAS-L standard deviation calculated using data before 2016.

To obtain the three pairs of Δt for the NPIF and SPIF dh/dt grids (one for each model), we performed a grid search over Δt and selected those that minimized the root mean square (rms) misfit between estimated and a priori density parameters (Supplementary Fig. S2). No constraints were applied to the least squares problems, except for model C where we applied a soft constraint requiring the density of G2 to be the average of G1 and G3.","['Gómez', 'Demián D.', 'Division Of Geodetic Science', 'School Of Earth Sciences', 'The Ohio State University', 'Columbus', 'Bevis', 'Michael G.', 'Smalley', 'Center For Earthquake Research']",

I n most companies, leading human resources is an insider’s job. Chief people officers traditionally spend their time setting compensation and benefits, strategizing over headcount and navigating administrative hurdles rather than working with customers or bringing together peers.

But when Rachel Romer, cofounder and CEO of workplace education and upskilling platform Guild, recently decided to redesign the chief people officer role at her company, she wanted something different. “The job is as much being the leader of the chief people officer community that we work with as it is focusing inward,” says Romer, comparing it to chief technology officers at tech companies who run internal systems but also act as tech advisers for their customers. “We’re a human capital company, so we wanted to have a broader chief people officer remit that looked externally.”

To fill it, she tapped former Patagonia human resources leader Dean Carter, a widely followed executive who left the outdoor retailer in May after a seven-year run. At Patagonia, Carter told Forbes in an exclusive interview, he instituted a four-day workweek every other week, eliminated ratings in the company’s performance reviews, rethought its employee engagement surveys and helped build up a purpose-driven culture in a place known for employee activism.

“A lot of the [CHROs] we work with really want to spend more time with Dean,” says Romer, who says she met Carter “serendipitously” when he was a keynote speaker at a Guild event. “A big part of his scope is to be available to the chief people officer community. … We're going to really carve it out as part of his job.”

Industry experts say that kind of expanded role is reflective of a growing trend among human capital-related companies to have chief people officers who are more external facing. As H.R. tools increasingly do more than just administrative work like counting workers’ hours—and help with strategic issues like employee well-being, upskilling or development—it matters even more to have leaders with H.R. credibility who can speak with partners or clients, says industry analyst Josh Bersin.

At companies whose clients are H.R. leaders, “the CHRO is increasingly the culture officer who represents the company to customers and can speak peer-to-peer with the buyer,” says Bersin, who says he’s seen similar set-ups at companies like Workday. When H.R. leaders buy tools or platforms like Guild, he says, “they’re staking their careers on it. They want to know that this company is the kind of company they want to be affiliated with. Dean has the kind of gravitas to do that.”

Carter’s H.R. experience includes not only leading the function at Patagonia—which, with its lofty mission to save the planet, might make culture-building seem an easier feat—but running human resources at Sears when it was a troubled retailer closing stores and facing credit downgrades.

The move comes at a time when chief people officers have been gaining stature in the C-suite after playing the role of public health officer, social issues coordinator and remote-work puzzle solver amid the pandemic’s workplace disruptions. At the same time, a tight labor market and need for tech skills across industries has elevated the role.

Covid and the racial reckoning that followed the killing of George Floyd, Carter says, were a game-changer for CHROs. “Every single day and in every single leadership meeting, you’re the person who speaks first, for two years,” he says, making “decisions almost weekly on life and death [issues]. … [As a CHRO], I’m now the chief medical officer, I’m now head of not just DEI, but of justice and anti-racism.”

Jason Hanold, who runs an executive search firm and recruited Carter to Patagonia, says that in meetings about new CHRO searches, he’s even asking whether a candidate should be a potential CEO successor, a question “I never asked 10 years ago,” he says. “Now it’s met with almost this unflinching ‘oh, absolutely.’ That’s different. That lends itself to rethought roles.”

Hanold says Carter quickly built “followership” in former jobs at Fossil and Sears and “gets and [understands] how a founder influences culture.” Among chief people officers “who actually look for counsel and advice and outside perspective, he’s very credible.”

Carter left Patagonia in May, he says, wanting a break after the intensity of the pandemic; he also knew at the time that the Chouinard family’s decision about giving away the company was on the horizon. “I went there, to Patagonia, to make change, to build the team, to understand the DNA and replicate it in systemic ways, and I think I did that,” he says. An email to a Patagonia spokesperson was not immediately returned.

The day he left Patagonia, Carter says, he got a call from his urologist saying he had prostate cancer (after surgery, he says tests now show he is cancer-free) and within two weeks got a speaking request for a Guild event, where he and Romer connected.

He takes over at a time when many companies, especially those in the tech sector that are venture-backed, are cutting headcount. Some may also consider trimming resources like employee training as they look to cut costs in a downturn. But Romer says Guild primarily brought costs down earlier this year by closing open or planned jobs, and has not had to do large-scale structural cuts of its workforce; she also sees the long-term labor dynamics at play in the current market.

“We spend most of our time thinking about Main Street, not Silicon Valley and Wall Street,” says Romer. Those companies, she says, are “hiring and we still have tremendous job shortages. … No matter what happens in the next six or 12 months, the demographic trends—the five-year and the 50-year trends—are so problematic for the United States when it comes to labor.”

At Guild, which has roughly 1400 employees, Carter’s early internal focus will be on career paths for employees and continuing to work on diversity and inclusion. But his job will also be to help develop Guild’s leadership team and work externally with Guild’s CHRO partners. He plans to create a consortium of leading CHROs, develop a curriculum that H.R. leaders can take through Guild’s marketplace to develop their careers and serve as an advocate for H.R. leaders in webinars and events.

“We have an opportunity to really shape the future of work,” Carter says of the ideas he hopes will drive these external conversations. “We had a moment where the future of work was how you consolidate the opportunity for everyone into just a few people, and I think we have to figure out—all of us, not just a few—how to spread opportunity across lots of people.”","['Jena Mcgregor', 'Forbes Staff']",2022-12-12 00:00:00

Catch the latest episode at 9 p.m. ET/PT Sunday on CNN.

CNN —

The blue whale’s giant corpse was lying washed up on a rocky beach on the Pacific coast of Patagonia, at the southern tip of South America. The huge mammal was 46 feet (14 meters) long, and its deflated body yielded no visible clue as to how it had died.

It took Frederick Toro Cortes, a wildlife veterinarian at Santo Tomás University in Chile, and his team five exhausting hours to perform an autopsy on the wet, uneven pebbles. Divided into three groups, they used large butcher knives to penetrate the thick layer of fat and muscle at three key points in the whale’s body – its upper back, belly and skull.

Beneath the pleated skin and the blubber, the researchers found 10 liters of blood – evidence of internal bleeding – and a 31.5-inch (80-centimeter) bruise (hematoma) at the base of its heart. The injury was likely a result of blunt force trauma to the chest. Whales have no natural predators. Toro Cortes suspected the whale collided with one of the increasing number of vessels that travel through these waters.

“The only thing that can generate this in these animals is a ship strike at high speed,” he said.

“It is very difficult for a 14-meter blue whale to die from a trauma from a rock in the middle of the sea. In addition, there are no predators that carry out this type of strategy to hunt juvenile whales.”

In the same week a film crew documented Toro Cortes conducting the autopsy in April 2021 as part of the new CNN Original Series “Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World,” two other whales were reported dead in Chilean waters. Typically, Chile records four dead whales a year, Toro Cortes said.

The autopsy confirmed that the dead marine mammal was male and 4 years old. Blue whales, the largest animals known to have ever existed on Earth, can live to be 100. Had the young whale survived, it might have fathered more than 20 calves.

“With the postmortem we can prove that they are dying,” Toro Cortes said in the CNN Original Series. “This allows us to put pressure on the government to regulate ship traffic.”

High-traffic zone

The fingerlike fjords, sheltered bays and inner seas of the Patagonian Pacific coast off Chile are important summer feeding grounds for blue whales. Nutrient-rich fresh water from the steeply sided valleys mixes with the ocean, creating dense patches of krill – tiny crustaceans that blue whales scoop up by the million with their massive jaws.

The International Whaling Commission has identified the region as one of 12 with at-risk populations of whales. Since 2007, the commission has logged at least 1,200 collisions between ships and whales globally. However, for every accident observed and reported there will be many others completely unnoticed.

Understanding just how many whales are killed by ships and what that means for their conservation is challenging, but some researchers think that fatal encounters may explain why blue whale numbers haven’t fully recovered from decimation by commercial whaling.

“People don’t realize how much of a global problem it is. These charismatic animals – everyone loves whales – they’ve actually become the ocean’s roadkill,” said Susannah Buchan, an oceanographer at the University of Concepción in Chile.

A salmon farm in the waters off the coast of Chilean Patagonia is shown.

In the inner seas off Chilean Patagonia, boats connected to industrial salmon farming pose a big threat. Salmon aren’t native to the Southern Hemisphere, but the rich water conditions mimic those found off the coast of Scotland and Norway. Chile has become the world’s second-largest producer of farmed salmon and the largest exporter to the United States.

“I think we’ve had this image of Patagonia, and it’s like this vast wilderness, maybe on land, for sure. But the marine environment is heavily industrialized due to the salmon farming,” Buchan said.

“And so that means that there’s huge amounts of traffic from large barges that transport the salmon that have been harvested or barges that transport the larval stages, or antibiotics or … food for the salmon. So there’s all this traffic going on in quite a narrow area.”

Measures that might work along an open coastline – such as changing shipping routes – don’t work with the geography of islands and inlets.

Using satellite trackers placed on 14 whales off the coast of northern Chilean Patagonia and publicly available shipping information, researchers of a 2021 study found that the whales feed in spaces subject to intense marine traffic – and the majority of vessels belonged to the salmon farming industry.

An animation (see below) based on some of the data researchers collated shows a lonely blue dot – the whale – contending with around 1,000 boats moving daily.

What’s more, from monitoring the dive patterns of the whales, Buchan said she also discovered that they surface more at night to feed on krill – making the mammals even harder for ships to spot.

“The captain might feel a bump or not feel anything.”

A whale love song

Using underwater microphones or hydrophones, Buchan has studied whale acoustics in Patagonian waters since 2007. She has recorded tens of thousands of hours of blue whale songs and discovered that the blue whales off the coast of Chile produce a unique dialect – although it’s subsonic and can’t be heard by human ears.

“It’s a series of very low-frequency pulses, like a kind of rumbling, almost,” she said. “And the Chilean dialect maybe has a few extra sounds. It’s maybe slightly more complex. And maybe it’s got some higher-frequency components.”

Identifying this unique whale song, which only male blue whales make, has enabled Buchan and other conservationists to track and learn more about the population’s movements. However, the noise large ships make is in the same frequency band as the songs made by blue whales, Buchan’s data also revealed. Their songs are masked by the noise from ships.

“These calls, which are reproductive calls likely from males to females so that they can get together and reproduce, can no longer be heard between individuals,” she said. “We also know from other species that ship noise increases physiological stress in these animals. So when all mammals are stressed, even humans, reproductive outcomes are affected. So they have less babies.”

Toro Cortes, the wildlife veterinarian who performed the blue whale necropsy, has also worked with humpback whales off the southern tip of Patagonia in Francisco Coloane Marine Park in the Straits of Magellan. There, he has used drones to try and capture mucus samples from the spouts of air emitted from their blowholes.

He said he hopes that detecting stress hormones in the samples will help build a case for better regulations in this maritime area, so that ships slow down as whales pass.

“Ship traffic can cause real stress and affect their behavior, even changing where they feed,” Toro Cortes said in “Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World.”

What’s being done

To reduce the risk of ship strikes, Buchan is working to develop a warning system for waters off Chile’s Patagonian coast that will warn ship traffic to the presence of whales. Moored buoys equipped with hydrophones to capture whale songs and transmission systems will produce alerts informing mariners how likely they are to encounter whales on their routes, allowing them to slow down or reroute.

“A ship that’s traveling slower will make less noise,” Buchan said, “and a ship that’s traveling slower will be less likely to fatally injure a whale.”

Similar systems have been tested with successful results in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Maine and in the Pacific off California’s coast.

With funding from the World Wildlife Fund, prototype buoys are being built in the lab, and Buchan said she hopes they will be tested in the waters off northern Chilean Patagonia soon.

“The whales are there on a mission to get fat so that they can survive for the rest of the year, and that’s their priority. For them to be dodging all this (ship) traffic is a real interruption to their business. And it’s also dangerous,” Buchan said.

“An ocean without whales would be devastating for all of us. If we want healthy oceans, then we want whales to be part of those ecosystems,” she said in the CNN Original Series.",['Katie Hunt'],2022-07-15 00:00:00
https://gearjunkie.com/apparel/patagonia-torrentshell-3l-jacket-review,A Classic Shell Jacket Gets New Tech: Patagonia Torrentshell 3L Jacket Review,"Newly updated — the Patagonia Torrentshell 3L gets a big upgrade in the waterproofing department.

We love a good comeback story, but the truth is that the Torrentshell rain jacket hasn’t ever fallen out of style. It has only gotten better. One of Patagonia’s most popular jackets, the Torrentshell 3L Jacket has staying power, and for good reason.

In its current adaptation, the Torrentshell gains a half layer in its proprietary Patagonia H2No membrane over its predecessor, and with it a bump in overall waterproofing and durability. But more so than that, it’s the jacket’s overall versatility and accessibility that has won us over.

We tested the latest version of the Torrentshell 3L jacket in Washington state’s Cascades this spring. We found that at its price range, there are few other jackets that can compete with the value this jacket provides. It may not be the most breathable or packable rain jacket, but for general hiking and everyday use, it’s easily one of the first we’d reach for.

In short: At $150, the Torrentshell 3L Jacket undercuts plenty of other jackets — and beats them out in a good number of metrics. A newly updated three-layer H2No waterproof membrane brings this classic piece into the present, and makes it a viable choice for anyone looking for a grab-and-go shell.

Brewed up especially for Patagonia, the proprietary H2No Performance Standard technology used in the Torrentshell specs out at 20,000mm waterproofness, which proved in our testing to be far sufficient to keep out nasty downpours and gales.

The new three-layer membrane adds an additional tricot backing, which improves moisture wicking and helps keep the membrane clear of body oils that would otherwise block and impede waterproof performance. We see this as an excellent update to the Torrentshell jacket.

This additional layer does come with a penalty in weight and bulk (our two primary complaints), but considering that most other competing rain jackets utilize a 2.5-layer membrane, you gain a considerable amount of waterproofing for the tradeoff.

Jackets like the Outdoor Research Dryline or the Mountain Hardwear Stretch Ozonic both come in at a similar price point but won’t provide the same long-lasting waterproofness.

There are no published breathability ratings for H2No waterproof membranes (trust us, we’ve scoured the internet). But, in testing, we found the Patagonia Torrentshell 3L’s ability to breathe as better than other 2.5-layer jackets, and about as good as other three-layer shells.

Compared to a jacket like the 66 North Snaefell, which uses a Polartec NeoShell three-layer membrane, the difference is noticeable, but that jacket runs $375 more. And for the money, the Torrentshell is absolutely capable.

During difficult climbs, we needed to vent with the pit zips, which isn’t uncommon, and we were thankful for the dual-zippered underarm openings to keep air flowing.

Comfort

With a stiffer feel than some other rain jackets, the Torrentshell feels like a rain jacket of old, and does produce a bit of a crinkle when in use. We’re unsure if this is due in part to the 100% recycled (50% pre-consumer, 50% post-consumer nylon) face fabric, but it makes sense to chalk it up to that. We’d imagine with some use this jacket would break in and become more supple.

The added wicking textile on the interior of the jacket does increase the overall comfort and feel, but the shell is missing a few key niceties (soft chin guard, please!).

Weight & Packed Size

At 13.9 ounces, the Torrentshell isn’t your wispy trail runner’s emergency shell, but it’s not designed to be. Patagonia’s own Storm10 Jacket uses the same three-layer version of its H2No waterproof membrane, but it comes in at a svelte 8.3 ounces overall. The Torrentshell’s weight and bulk are largely due to its 50D nylon ripstop face fabric and burlier construction.

Patagonia was certainly channeling its Wear it For Life ethos and aimed to create a jacket that would stand up to seasons of abuse — and they nailed it with the Torrentshell.

Zippers, Pockets, and Hood

As a more budget-minded jacket, the Torrentshell doesn’t make use of any waterproof zippers that are seen in higher-end rain shells. Instead, the main zipper sports a unique three-fold storm flap arrangement that encases the zipper and seals out weather, which we found to work well. The same storm flap design is found on the hand pocket zippers and pit zips.

The right-hand pocket has a double-sided zipper and carabiner loop, meaning the entire shell can be stuffed into it for ease of transport. The hood, while not helmet-compatible, did fit well and is two-way adjustable with a laminated brim.

Sustainability & Durability

Patagonia’s decision to make the Torrentshell out of its three-layer H2No waterproof membrane will certainly up the durability of the jacket in the long run, along with the thicker 50D face fabric. We struggle to think that anything but the most brutal treatment would begin to wear down this jacket, and in testing, we couldn’t put a scratch on it.

We’ve previously hailed the Torrentshell as being highly sustainable, but also understand there’s no free lunch. Reaching for a jacket that has tipped the scales in any one direction typically means it’s more liable to suffer in another metric.

For sustainable jackets, that often boils down to overall performance. Rain jackets of old used all types of petrochemicals to achieve their waterproof performance. While Patagonia is making moves to use only fluorocarbon-free DWR finishes in all of its outerwear by fall 2022, the Torrentshell unfortunately still uses the old stuff.

Conclusion

The Patagonia Torrentshell 3L Jacket would make an easy choice for anyone looking to grab a rain jacket and go. The newly updated three-layer H2No waterproof membrane greatly improved this already classic jacket, and places it head and shoulders above others in the same range.

A highly sustainable build — featuring 100% recycled face fabric, Fair Trade certified sewing, and a PU membrane that incorporates 13% bio-based content — rounds out this everyday shell. The jacket does make some concessions, namely in average breathability, bulkier packed size, and stiffer fabric. But at the $150 price point, few jackets come close to touching it in terms of accessible performance.

Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World (9 p.m., CNN)

A six-part docuseries narrated by Chilean-born Pedro Pascal explores the wonders of Patagonia in South America, one of the last untouched places on earth.

From CNN: “Stretching for more than a thousand miles through Chile and Argentina, Patagonia is a place unlike any other: wild, isolated, pristine, and unexplored. The region’s iconic wildlife – pumas, penguins, condors, and killer whales – thrive in a rich diversity of habitats, and species new to science – insect, bird, and even mammal – are discovered here each year.”

The documentary series takes audiences across Patagonia’s diverse and spectacular landscapes, traveling along its coastline from wind-blown deserts to pristine fjordlands, from deep inside its magical, ancient forests up to the high peaks of the Andes. It showcases the wildlife, the scientists who study it, and the people of the region who have evolved to live in these varied habitats.

“Patagonia: Life on the Edge” was filmed over the course of one year, using state-of-the-art cameras and help from local experts granting unprecedented access.

The series will regularly air on Sundays at 9 p.m. and will stream live for pay TV subscribers via CNN.com and CNN OTT and mobile apps under “TV Channels” or CNNgo where available. The series will also be available On Demand the day after the broadcast premiere to pay TV subscribers via CNN.com, CNN apps, and Cable Operator Platforms.

My route spanned nearly 100 miles across the Italian Alps, with more than 26 thousand feet of elevation gain and loss, which meant I had to move fast and light. Thankfully, the trail passes more than a dozen huts where I could refill water, load up on butter-heavy calories, and bunk for the night—allowing me to pare down my kit to the weight of a typical day pack. Still, my mission required considerable essentials: poles, raincoat, puffy, buff, gloves, sunglasses, headlamp, stroopwafels, electrolytes, two 500m flasks, first aid kit, InReach satellite communicator, emergency shelter—and the much-appreciated windbreaker.

The run was an ideal setting for testing the Exploration, a new 18-liter vest-pack hybrid built on the fundamentals of the brand’s existing Slope Runner series. This version carries on the line’s tradition of keeping things simple and highly functional, while expanding the storage capacity by more than double the volume. The pack has a large main compartment, four front pockets on the shoulder straps, one hidden zippered pocket, and one external lash point for an ice ax, poles, or helmet.

But the new Exploration is different from its smaller siblings in more than just size. Patagonia designed the Exploration for big alpine missions and overnight trips that necessitate more gear than a typical running vest, but also require agility and comfort for long days. The pack accommodates bulky items like a small sleeping bag or bivvy, and carries moderate weight with little bounce or movement on your back, thanks to a top cinch closure paired with added elastic cords that loop into the shoulder straps to pull volume and weight close to your body.

Patagonia tapped the expertise of athletes like ultrarunner Luke Nelson to dial features in the Exploration. “I spent several years working with the designers to build this adventure vest,” Nelson told me. “I’ve used it for Tor Des Geants, multi-day running in Nepal, and dozens of adventures in the backyard. I think it is a great fusion of simplicity with just the features you need to get way out there.”

Having tested it in the Tetons and Cascades myself, I wanted to see how the Exploration would handle multi-day use and abuse, and the timing worked out to employ it on the High Route in northern Italy.

The good news is that the pack does an incredible job at the most important thing: carrying weight securely, even while running at a good clip. At one point I was hauling 15 pounds comfortably while negotiating steep switchbacks at speed. To date I’ve had zero chafing or wear issues, and often forgot how much I was carrying on my back. This is a rare feat. It’s easy to make a pack that carries a lot; it’s harder to make one that doesn’t bounce or sway while doing it. Oh, and the pack itself weighs only one pound.

The biggest downside is the design of the main compartment. It’s completely unstructured, so to stay organized, I packed my gear in stuff sacks, then put them inside the large compartment. I didn’t mind using the smaller sacks—it helped keep things organized and within reach. But what did bother me was the surprisingly narrow opening, making it cumbersome to take gear in and out (especially larger items like a camera). Another knock: while the pack comes with a weather-resistant DWR finish, the top closure doesn’t seal completely, so I often used a pack cover in heavy rain, just to be safe. These feel like obvious fixes for the next iteration.

Some of the Exploration’s finer details became noticeable over time. A perforated stiffener panel adds structure to the back, improving stability with moderate and heavy weights. The front pockets are easy to use and have enough space for snacks, full flasks, and other small essentials. Plus, I’ve found the 210-denier, 100 percent recycled ripstop nylon used for the body shell to be incredibly durable thus far, despite brushes against rocks and brambles and regularly being tossed into the corner of huts.

Overall I rank this vest-pack hybrid as one of the best in its class for its ability to carry weight much more comfortably than its competitors. This supersedes all other functionality for anyone looking to get into long alpine linkups, fast scrambles, and warm-weather fast-and-light missions.

Credit: U. Sokolowicz

Scientists investigating the remains of an old wooden ship off the cold, windy coast of far southern Argentina say it almost certainly is the Dolphin, a globe-trotting whaling ship from Warren, R.I., lost in 1859. Archaeologists have spent years researching the ship's origin without making a definitive identification, but a new analysis of tree rings in its timbers has provided perhaps the most compelling evidence yet. A team of Argentinian and American researchers just published the findings in the journal Dendrochronologia.

""I cannot say with a hundred percent certainty, but analysis of the tree rings indicates it is very likely that this is the ship,"" said lead author Ignacio Mundo of Argentina's Laboratory of Dendrochronology and Environmental History, IANIGLA-CONICET. Mundo and scientists at the Columbia Climate School's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory used a huge database of rings from old North American trees to show that the timbers were felled in New England and the southeastern United States just before the ship was built in 1850. Other evidence includes artifacts found near the wreck, and historical accounts from Argentina and Rhode Island. This appears to be the first time tree-ring science has been applied to identify a South American shipwreck.

""It's fascinating that people built this ship in a New England town so long ago, and it turned up on the other side of the world,"" said Columbia tree-ring scientist Mukund Rao, a coauthor of the study.

New England was a major player in the global whaling trade from the mid-1770s until the 1850s, when oil extracted from blubber was popular for lighting and lubrication, and whale bone was used in many small household items now made of plastic. Hundreds of Yankee ships roamed remote regions, often on voyages that lasted for years. The industry faded in the 1860s after whale populations were decimated, and petroleum came in.

According to an unpublished manuscript by local Warren historian Walter Nebiker, the Dolphin was built between August and October 1850, of oak and other woods. Normally trees were felled in cold weather a year or so before a ship was built, which in this case would have been between late 1849 and February 1850. Measuring 111 feet long and weighing 325 tons, the Dolphin was launched Nov. 16, 1850. Nebiker described her as ""probably the fastest square-rigger of all time.""

The ship ranged across the Atlantic and Indian oceans for nearly two and half years, returning laden with oil in March 1853. Later trips took her to the Azores and around the Horn of Africa to the Seychelles, Zanzibar and Australia. Her last voyage started from Warren on Oct. 2, 1858. The ship ended up off Patagonia a few months later. A letter to the owners from her master, a Captain Norrie, said she was destroyed when she ""lay upon the rocks in the southwestern part of New Bay""—an apparent reference to the Golfo Nuevo, one of Patagonia's few good natural harbors, where whalers were known to put in. The crew would have sailed some 10,000 miles to get there.

Beyond ships that put in temporarily, there was no real European presence along the Golfo Nuevo until 1865, when Welsh immigrants landed on the site of what later became the city of Puerto Madryn. Local tradition has it that early settlers scavenged material from one or more shipwrecks, but it is unclear whether this was from the Dolphin or some other ill-fated ship or ships.

In 2004, shifting sediments revealed the partial remains of a wooden vessel in the intertidal flats just off Puerto Madryn. Locals knew it was there, but scientists had not. In 2006 and 2007, marine archaeologists including Cristian Murray of Argentina's National Institute of Anthropology and Latin American Studies excavated the remains during low tides. They also documented several other other wrecks nearby.

About all left of the ship was some of the lower futtocks, or ribs, and some hull and ceiling planking. In a 2009 paper, Murray and colleagues determined that the ship was built probably in the 19th century, mainly of oak and pine from the Northern Hemisphere. But of what species and whether European or North American origin, they could not tell. With little else to go on—some brass nails, a single leather shoe—they speculated it could have been a fishing or merchant vessel—or a whaler.

Other evidence eventually turned up. Two iron cauldrons and the remains of bricks were found near the wreck, suggesting a shipboard ""try-works"" for boiling down blubber. Murray and colleagues also discovered that Argentine mariner Luis Piedrabuena had rescued 42 crew members of the Dolphin; he took them to Carmen de Patagones, a town about 100 miles north, and from there the refugees hopefully made it home. Where would that have been? The Dolphin showed up in Lloyd's marine insurance register as having come from Warren. The researchers then contacted the Warren Preservation Society, which provided Nebiker's manuscript and other information.

Based on this, a local Rhode Island newspaper speculated in 2012 that the Dolphin had been found. In 2019 Murray finally published a paper suggesting this—but saying it could not be proven. Enter the tree-ring scientists.

That year, Murray and colleagues re-excavated the wreck and invited Ignacio Mundo to examine it. They were horrified when Mundo told them the only way to get decent samples of the sodden wood would be to chainsaw out a couple dozen cross sections of the ribs and planking, and dry them out. Eventually, realizing there was no other way, the archaeologists relented and picked out spots where they thought the least damage would be done.

After processing the samples in his lab, Mundo turned to Ed Cook, founder of the Lamont-Doherty Tree Ring Lab, a longtime collaborator with South American colleagues, and pioneer in dendroarchaeology, the science of pinpointing the age and provenance of old wooden structures. Cook has analyzed many old buildings in the U.S. Northeast, along with objects including an 18th-century sloop accidentally unearthed during excavations after the World Trade Center was destroyed in 2001. (He figured out it had been built of oak around 1773 near Philadelphia.)

Cook's secret weapon: the North American Drought Atlas, a massive database whose creation he spearheaded in the early 2000s. The atlas collates ring samples from about 30,000 standing trees of many species across the continent going back more than 2,000 years. Varying precipitation levels create subtle yearly variations in ring width that allow researchers to chart past climates, date trees' precise years of germination and growth—and in the case of old wooden structures, often where and when trees were cut, since climates vary from place to place, leaving distinct regional signatures.

The dendrochronologists determined that the ribs were made of white oak, many species of which grow in the northeast United States. The hull and ceiling planks, they could tell, were old-growth yellow pine, forests of which once covered much of the U.S. Southeast. Wooden nails holding things together were made of rot-resistant black locust, widespread across many eastern states.

Analysis of the oak rings showed that some of the timbers came from trees that had sprouted as far back as 1679. Most striking: The outermost rings indicated the oaks had been cut in 1849—exactly coinciding with the Dolphin's 1850 construction. The latest rings in the pine planking came from 1810, but the scientists were unbothered by this; unlike the thick ribs, the planks would have been extensively milled down, so no one expected to find the outer rings.

The scientists then compared the rings to specific regional chronologies. Most of the pine samples matched well with chronologies taken decades ago from living trees in Alabama's Choccolocco Mountain and Georgia's Lake Louise areas, both known for exporting massive amounts of pine to the northern states in the 19th century. The researchers couldn't say if the planks came from those sites specifically, but the signatures indicated that they must have come from somewhere in Alabama, Georgia or northern Florida.

As for the oak ribs, the rings most closely resembled chronologies taken from old trees growing in Massachusetts. Among the markers: distinct dry, low-growth periods in the 1680s-90s, 1700s and 1810s. The rings' very narrow widths indicated the trees had grown in dense, old-growth forest—most of which was cut down in New England during the early to mid-1800s as loggers swept through. Many of those Massachusetts oaks undoubtedly ended up in the ship yards of next-door Rhode Island.

The new paper still hedges its bets, saying the ship may very well be the Dolphin, but absent some unique artifact associated with the vessel, it could conceivably be some other American whaler from the same time. ""There were many whaling ships in that area during that time,"" said Murray, who coauthored the paper. ""So I don't like to say it is the Dolphin until we can get more evidence.""

However, Mukund Rao, the Lamont dendrochronologist, says he is completely convinced. ""The archaeologists are more conservative—they prefer a slightly higher standard, and I don't blame them,"" he said. ""It's true we don't have something like the ship's bell. But for me, the story is there in the tree rings.""

The decision of Yvon Chouinard, founder of the outdoor fashion brand Patagonia, to give away the company to a charitable trust in order to fight climate change and environmental risk, has shaken up the investment community across the world and potentially launched a new era for sustainable development.

Chouinard’s move means that any profit that is not reinvested in Patagonia will be redistributed as dividends to protect the planet. In order to do this, the Chouinard family has transferred all ownership to two new entities, the Patagonia Purpose Trust and the Holdfast Collective.

The Patagonia Purpose Trust is now the owner of all the voting stock of the company, which is about 2% of the total stock, while the Holdfast Collective owns the remaining 98% (all the non-voting stock).

The plan is that the Holdfast Collective will utilise every dollar received from Patagonia to protect nature and biodiversity, support communities and fight the environment crisis. It is estimated that it will pay around $100m as a dividend per year.

Will Patagonia move lead to a new era for ESG?

With this move, Patagonia has raised the stakes when it comes to ESG, but what impact will it have?

First, Chouinard said that “instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth, we are using the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source. We’re making Earth our only shareholder.” Thus, Patagonia is looking to protect the nature that is primarily the source of the company’s clothes, instead of only using nature as a way to create wealth.

Second, this is an example of a prominent business figure leading by example. It is now hoped that this move will influence more business leaders to embrace the world’s ESG challenges in a more meaningful way, as opposed to seeing addressing these issues as merely a tick-box exercise.

Third, all eyes will now be on the types of projects the Holdfast Collective backs to help the fight against climate change, and in which sectors and regions.

Patagonia has been proactive in helping communities move away from fossil fuels, and it has transformed the way it does business in order to cut its carbon emissions. The data below shows that the bulk of the company’s emissions come from its supply chain and materials manufacturing.

The fashion industry is considered to be one of the largest polluters globally, as it is responsible for 10% of annual global emissions. It would therefore be hugely significant if more companies from the apparel sector were to follow the example of Patagonia when it comes to cutting down their emissions, opting for sustainably sourced and organically grown materials, and reinvesting at least some percentage of their profits in the fight against climate change.

Chouinard's announcement garnered Patagonia columns and columns of good publicity, but this move was no gimmick or attempt at greenwashing. The gesture may have an impact, or it may be too little, too late. It has, however, certainly raised the bar when it comes to just how far a company can go with its commitment to all things ESG.","['Sofia Karadima', 'Sofia Karadima Is A Senior Editor', 'Researcher At Investment Monitor', 'Focusing On Financial', 'Business Services', 'Esg Investing.

CNN —

The ancient monkey puzzle tree has distinctive spiny leaves and intricate scaly branches. Its unusual features, scientists believe, evolved as a defense against towering, long-necked dinosaurs.

Reaching up to 160 feet (48.8 meters) tall and able to live for a millennium, the evergreen tree is a survivor from the Jurassic era, more than 145 million years ago.

Araucaria araucana outlasted the dinosaurs, but today scientific experts consider the tree endangered. Cultivated monkey puzzle trees grow in gardens and parks around the world, but in the wild the species only grows along the slopes of Patagonia’s volcanoes in Chile and Argentina.

Fires, land clearance, overgrazing and logging have shrunk the temperate forest where the monkey puzzle tree grows. Its large seeds are also a prized food source for an endemic species of bird, the austral parakeet.

The green-hued parrots, in flocks of about 15 birds, flit from tree to tree to find a good spot to fatten up for the winter. When the birds hit the jackpot, their numbers can swell to more than 100, and they gorge on monkey puzzle pine nuts.

The marauding parakeets, despite their bottomless appetite for the nuts, actually could be helping the monkey puzzle trees survive in Patagonia, recent research has found.

Scientists say the birds act as a buffer against the threat posed by human overharvesting of the nuts.

The parakeets typically take the pine nuts and consume them from a treetop perch dozens of feet away. Often, the birds only partially eat the seeds.

In fact, the partial removal of the seed coat by parakeets enhanced the germination speed of monkey puzzle seeds, according to the 2018 study.

“They (the parakeets) play an important role in the regeneration of the araucaria forests as the partially eaten seeds they leave on the ground are not selected by seed collectors, and they retain their germination potential,” explained two of the study authors, Gabriela Gleiser and Karina Speziale, researchers at Argentina’s Biodiversity and Environment Research Institute at the National University of Comahue.

What’s more, they said via email, the parakeets disperse the seeds, which means the trees regenerate further away from the mother plant.

Gleiser and Speziale are also investigating whether the parakeets, as they flap from branch to spiny branch, pollinate the female cones.

The parakeets aren’t the only residents who eat these nuts. They are also a traditional source of food for Chile’s and Argentina’s Indigenous Mapuche people, who skillfully climb the monumental trees to collect seeds and pound them into a flour that can be baked into bread. The nuts, which are larger than almonds, are also eaten more widely in the two countries, particularly Chile.

The Mapuche have the right to collect nuts in their ancestral area; however, beyond this, local authorities restrict the amount of nuts that can be collected for personal and commercial purposes and require a permit, Gleiser and Speziale said.

“Despite this, many illegal collectors exist who collect without respecting the collection limits,” the researchers added.

“Human seed collection represents an important threat to (the) monkey puzzle tree’s reproduction in those populations that are accessible for people, as illegal seed collectors almost deplete the seed pools produced by the trees.”

However, the nuts damaged by the parakeets are discarded by collectors, so the partially eaten nuts can still germinate.

The Mapuche lifestyle is interwoven with the monkey puzzle tree. However, it was a bond that was almost broken during colonial times and up to the 1990s, when industrial loggers stripped the land, including the Araucaria trees. Demanding legal protection for the species, the Mapuche clashed with loggers and the Chilean government. The monkey puzzle trees are now protected by law across Patagonia.

The monkey puzzle trees can grow to 160 feet tall and live for 1,000 years.

“The Araucaria are just like the Mapuche people … even though they have been mistreated, beaten up, we all stay strong,” Petrona Pellao, a member of the Mapuche Indigenous group, said in the CNN docuseries “Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World.”

The Mapuche are now replanting Araucaria trees and rediscovering their ancient ancestral practices. The goal is to help the Mapuche cultivate pine nuts sustainably and allow the Araucaria trees to thrive once again.",['Katie Hunt'],2022-08-17 00:00:00

From now on, the corporation’s profits will fund efforts to deal with climate change, as well as protect wilderness areas. It will, however, remain a privately held enterprise. According to initial reports about this unusual approach to philanthropy that ran on Sept. 14, 2022, Patagonia is worth about US$3 billion and its profits that will be donated in perpetuity could total $100 million every year.

The Conversation U.S. asked Indiana University’s Ash Enrici – a scholar who studies how philanthropy affects the environment – to explain why this arrangement is so significant.

1. Is this move part of a trend?

The biggest donors, those giving away billions of dollars, are increasingly making climate change a priority. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for example, announced in 2020 that he was putting $10 billion into his Earth Fund, and Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, said in 2021 that she would devote $3.5 billion of her fortune to fighting climate change.

Likewise, big donors are increasing their funding of conservation efforts.

In September 2021, the Earth Fund joined with eight other philanthropic powerhouses to pledge $5 billion to “support the creation, expansion, management and monitoring of protected and conserved areas of land, inland water and sea” around the world. This initiative aims to conserve 30% of Earth by 2030.

Within days of Chouinard’s announcement, another splashy climate gift emerged, setting a similar precedent. Filmmaker Adam McKay, who wrote, co-produced and directed the movie “Don’t Look Up,” said he will donate $4 million to a group that funds climate activism. His satirical film was a metaphor regarding climate inaction.

No matter how frequently these donations occur, it’s important to keep in mind that the cost of meeting the world’s environmental challenges is enormous and will cost trillions of dollars. So while all of these gifts are certainly significant in their scale, donors and governments will need to do and spend much more.

2. What makes it stand out?

What’s unusual about Chouinard’s climate-change gift is its structure. By giving away his company and directing that the profits be spent fighting climate change in the long term in the form of regular installments, he is creating a new model for large-scale donations.

It also sets a notable precedent. Chouinard and his family are giving away the source of their wealth and setting things up in a way that is going to result in a predictable form of support for work on climate issues – an estimated $100 million each year from Patagonia’s profits.

I think it’s a great example for other business owners and very wealthy people to follow.

3. How are conservation and climate change efforts connected?

Journalists, scholars and the public often treat addressing climate change and conserving ecosystems as being two distinct priorities. But they are instead closely related. Having ecosystems thrive in a way that protects biodiversity is a way to slow the pace of climate change.

Climate change itself will harm ecosystems and contribute to the loss of biodiversity through, for example, raising temperatures in large bodies of water to the point where established marine ecosystems become so disrupted that many species die off.

And the flip side of that is that maintaining healthy ecosystems can help counter climate change. For example, mangroves are often cut down for shrimp farming and other industries. But protecting them offers the potential to retain as much, or more, carbon as tropical rain forests, while also safeguarding the animals and plants on the land and in the water.

4. What do you think this money should fund?

To me, how they – the newly minted Patagonia Purpose Trust, which will own and run the company, and the Holdfast Collective, the nonprofit funded by Patagonia’s profits – operate will be just as important as what they fund.

Based on research I’m engaged in, I believe that they can do more good by reflecting on how they work, hopefully in ways that are both equitable and effective. For example, they can consider highly collaborative approaches, incorporate flexibility for adapting circumstances and long-term funding to match ecological timescales. It’s also essential that indigenous people living in the places affected by environmental work have a say and are heard.

Because the Holdfast Collective is a social welfare group, rather than a charity, it will be free to emphasize policy reform – which I think should be a major priority.

Government and international aid agencies are often too constrained by bureaucracy to be able to adapt and adjust their practices in a way that might be needed to address urgent environmental challenges.

Philanthropists are more free in terms of how they work. That means funders like Patagonia’s trust can provide seed money to jump-start new initiatives that later may be more heavily funded and scaled up by governments.

5. Why are many people troubled by gifts like this?

In recent years, scrutiny of philanthropy of all kinds has been on the rise. Some of the criticism takes aim at big donors, like Bezos, whose sources of wealth contribute to the problems their gifts are supposed to be solving.

Concerns about how philanthropy can perpetuate or excuse discrimination and oppression are also growing, leading to calls for its “decolonization.”

Even avid environmentalists are expressing deep concerns about the potential downsides of this new model. They’re asking whether it might be used to fund causes championed by other wealthy donors with starkly different agendas.

Regardless of what concerns you may have about what the Chouinard family decided to do, or regarding other billion-dollar donations that take aim at climate change, one thing is for sure: The cost of doing nothing at all will surely be much higher than taking action, however imperfectly.

NEW YORK – (June 16, 2022) – CNN Original Series will transport audiences to South America in the visually stunning docuseries, Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World, premiering Sunday, July 10 at 9pm ET/PT on CNN. Narrated by Chilean-born actor Pedro Pascal (The Mandalorian, Game of Thrones) and produced by Plimsoll Productions, this riveting series explores the wonders of one of the last untouched places on earth, the far-off land of Patagonia in South America.

“This summer, CNN embarks on new journey into the longform nonfiction space with Patagonia as we launch our first wildlife documentary series, breaking new ground for our CNN Original Series brand” said Amy Entelis, Executive Vice President for Talent & Content Development, CNN Worldwide. “We can’t wait for CNN audiences to discover the natural wonders of Patagonia and the majesty of the wildlife of the region.”

Stretching for more than a thousand miles through Chile and Argentina, Patagonia is a place unlike any other: wild, isolated, pristine, and unexplored. The region’s iconic wildlife – pumas, penguins, condors, and killer whales – thrive in a rich diversity of habitats, and species new to science – insect, bird, and even mammal – are discovered here each year. Across six captivating episodes, Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World takes audiences across Patagonia’s diverse and spectacular landscapes, traveling along its coastline from wind-blown deserts to pristine fjordlands, from deep inside its magical, ancient forests up to the high peaks of the Andes. With state-of-the-art cameras and help from local experts granting unprecedented access, this immersive docuseries showcases the wildlife, the scientists who study it, and the people of the region who have evolved to live in these varied habitats. Filmed over one dramatic year, throughout this epic journey, CNN Original Series reveals what it takes to survive at the edge of the world. This is Patagonia like you’ve never seen it before.

“I have great memories of taking trips to Patagonia and exploring some of the beautiful places depicted in the series,” said Pedro Pascal. “I am excited to bring my voice to the project and share this special part of the world with North American audiences.”

Executive producers for Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World are James Smith and Martha Holmes for Plimsoll Productions and Amy Entelis and Lyle Gamm for CNN Original Series. The series will regularly air on Sundays at 9pm ET/PT on CNN.

Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World will stream live for pay TV subscribers via CNN.com and CNN OTT and mobile apps under “TV Channels” or CNNgo where available.

Tuesday was the penultimate day of our southern ski season.

After learning the previous day that it was south faces or bust (other aspects were already sun cooked), we went for Scary Chute – a due south-facing chute with a fun rollover, rocks, and a wide-open runout.

Scary Chute is often precisely that, scary.

Firm, icy, chattery, rocky, narrow, and kinda ugly…

None of those words applied on this day.

I’ve never seen it so good.

Perfect F’ing Powder…

Usually, after a storm, the wind blows and changes all the powder to ‘carton’ (cardboard) here but for some reason, the wind didn’t blow for three days this cycle – which was dreamy.

I never feel confident atop this line, but I did this time.

It was clear that the chute was going to be perfect.

It was going to allow for high-speed turns, slashes, and fun.

What I wasn’t sure about was the runout.

It had a lot of avalanche chunder from the rain a few days back but the new snow on top should be enough to soften the blow.

I took a deep breath and dropped in.

The snow was as advertised: perfect powder.

I gained speed as my confidence in the snow increased.

My sixth turn in the chute might have been my favorite of the season.

Like skiing on powder rails with full response.

I blasted out onto the apron, hit the avalanche chunder, felt it was a-ok, and kept blasting down to the valley floor below.

I’ve never had Scary Chute so good.

I relished it as I sat on my pack eating cookies greedily.",['Miles Clark'],2022-09-23 12:53:20+00:00

Before we dig into the billion-and-one designs, we gotta talk length and shape. TikTok Teens would have you believe that a five-inch inseam is the only length that matters. Fellas like Milo Ventimiglia and Paul Mescal, however, might urge you to go up a couple of inches and show off a little more thigh. And on the other end of the spectrum entirely, the ever stylish Justin Bieber prefers to step out in loose, baggy shorts that would make members of Michigan's Fab Five proud.

The beauty is that you can go for anywhere along the spectrum—or, better yet, make a few stops along the way and stock your closet with a wide variety of shorts. Because there's an absolutely insane amount of styles out there. From the gorpiest, tech advanced jawns to the cotton and wool equivalents of a whiskey neat.

If you're still relying on your swishy basketball shorts to carry you from the court to brunch, we're here to help you out. We've turned up the 22 best shorts for men for every possible budget and need. Whether you’re after for an elegant pleated pair—à la Giorgio Armani—or just some breathable nylon beaters to get you through the weekend, we’ve scoured the market to bring you the grade-A options that’ll free your trunks.

The Best Shorts Shopping Guide

The Best All-Around Shorts

Season after season, the Baggies continue to reign supreme thanks to their heavenly blend of form and function. Crafted from quick-drying post-consumer recycled nylon, these shorts are a fine example of wearing your clothes in good conscience. It also doesn't hurt the flattering cut comes equipped with oh-so spacious mesh pockets, a stretchy elastic waist, and a secure rear pocket, allowing you to have your fun in the sun, whether that be on or off the grid. For $65, they're simply unbeatable.

The Best New Contender for the Crown

We love the Baggies. You love the Baggies. But none of that will stop FOG's Essentials line from trying to take the crown. The brand's sleek running shorts are designed to fit into your everyday wardrobe with feather-light-yet-durable nylon made to last, and a neutral color palette that gently whispers “vibes.” Riffing off a California cool that is oft-imitated but rarely mastered, the baggy silhouette cuts off at just three inches to show off your shapely limbs while maximizing breathability. Aaand they're less than $60, which is a score in general but a major come up for Jerry Lorenzo stans of all stripes.

The Best Everyday Shorts

Alex Mill flat front chino shorts $98 at Alex Mill

When you're after a pair of regular, everyday shorts that fit like a charm, Alex Mill truly understands the assignment. Their strategy? Take their best-selling chino pants and chop 'em down for summer wear. Wide-legged and relaxed with just a hint of stretch, they're about as versatile, comfortable, and timelessly stylish as a pair of shorts can be.

The Best Sweat Shorts

Todd Snyder + Champion 7"" midweight warm up short $88 at Todd Snyder

There comes a time in every mid to moderately active guy's life when he's on the hunt for the perfect sweat shorts. Maybe he begrudgingly agreed to join his team for a weekend spar on the court or it's too hot to get away with his go-to joggers; either way, it's suddenly a priority. Thankfully, Todd Snyder and Champion whipped up the perfect blend of comfort casual. Mid-weight cotton that won't leave you shuddering at the faintest breeze and a drawstring waist to secure the fit to your liking. And with seven generous inches, these shorts offer all the coverage you need, exactly where you want it.

The Best Jorts

Speaking of generous lengths, it's jorts season again! You might be wondering why on earth you'd spend money on half a pair of jeans. The answer is a) because it looks cool and b) you know you couldn't cut a straight line to save your life if you tried. Levi's 405 standard denim features a straight leg that looks good on just about everyone, with just the faintest bit of stretch for when you need to get moving. If you can bare to part with your favorite 501s, they won't be too far of a leap to make.

The Best Cargo Shorts

Is it any surprise that Nike makes the best cargo shorts? Their ACG line is one of pillars of the gorp aesthetic for plenty of reasons: technical fabrics whipped into figure-flattering shapes that both sneakerheads and the crunchiest among us can appreciate. This particular pair of cargo shorts has all the mesh and zipped-up pocket space you could need for stowing away your precious, um, cargo, along with an adjustable webbed belt. Even if you're just strolling down your city streets, with these on you'll feel ready for adventure.

The Best Dress Shorts

Comme Des Garçons Homme Deux pleated shorts $400 at SSENSE

Sometimes you have the itch to pair your ritzy button-down with a pair of flowy shorts–that or you've got a formal event coming up that will be conveniently located in an extremely humid locale. Obviously, you're not going to veer too casual on the bottom if the top is eliciting “sir”—but when even khakis feel like overkill, it's time to whip out the posh calf-hitting bottoms. These CDG pleated shorts have faint pinstripe-detailing that won't put you in Beetlejuice territory, but they will make you the smartest dressed dude in the room (or under the veranda). Made from pure 100% cotton with a silk satin lining, they feel as smooth as your entrance.

https://unofficialnetworks.com/2022/08/09/patagonia-north-face-so-different/,WATCH: How Did Patagonia And The North Face End Up So Different?,"It’s no secret that Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard and The North Face founder Doug Tompkins were lifelong friends all the way up to Tompkins’ death in a kayaking accident in 2015. The Patagonia logo, in fact, is based on the silhouette of Mount Fitzroy in, you guessed it, Patagonia, where Chouinard and Tompkins journeyed in 1968.

Despite the friendship between the two founders and the similarity in products, however, Patagonia and The North Face are two very different companies when it comes to their approach towards sales and environmental conservation. While Patagonia seeks partnerships with non-profits and works to defend land from oil companies, The North Face partners up with massive luxury brands like Gucci (that’s not to say The North Face doesn’t put any effort into conservation, but it’s certainly less than Patagonia). So how did these companies end up so incredibly different? What took one down the path to seek out conservation efforts, and the other down the path to seek out massive sales? Future Proof released this video back in December, and it explains it all.

As history can attest, nonprofits aren't enough to single-handedly eradicate poverty and inequality and infuse the workplace with jobs that make workers feel dignified and purposeful.

To pitch in, some companies are willing to bet on a different conceptualization of ""good business."" Perhaps most impressive of this group are B Corps — businesses that nonprofit B Lab grade each year to ensure they're meeting the highest standards of social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose.

Companies awarded B Corp status have committed to using their businesses to work toward a more inclusive and sustainable economy. They strive to reduce inequality; lower poverty levels; and create a healthier environment, stronger communities, and purposeful jobs.

They leverage their resources to pay into a better world, creating a definition of success that includes commonwealth and positive impact as necessary aspects of sustainable consumerism.

https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2022/05/09/patagonia-hang-tags/,Patagonia demonstrates how digitization helps both the environment and the bottom line,"Want to help the environment? Start small and use technology, according to Patagonia Inc.

The retailer recently overhauled the way it processes paper hang tags. Paper hang tags are still attached to each piece of clothing and include information about the brand and product. But Jennifer Patrick, global manager of packaging and branding, found a way to use QR codes and reduce paper hang tag versions from 453 to 20. That’s 170,000 pounds less landfill waste generated in a single season.

There are other advantages, too. The cost of assigning hang tag projects, designing, writing, managing, and fixing problems all adds up, Patrick says.

“We’re looking at money. We’re looking at environment. But we’re also analyzing the impact on our internal resources,” she says.

The outdoor clothing retailer has been in business since 1973 and continues to evolve how it offsets its impact on the environment. Patrick has been in the print industry for more than 20 years. She says she understands that internal process changes take time and need research. But the payoff to both retailers and the environment is worthwhile.

“We found that we didn’t lose any customer communication like product features or material technologies by eliminating the [paper] inserts,” she says.

Communicate with customers

Patagonia’s mission statement says, “we’re in business to save our home planet.” It is important to be transparent with customers about how, Patrick says.

Nearly one-fourth (24%) of U.S. consumers say they’ll avoid companies whose actions contradict their values, according to research company Forrester Inc.’s March 2021 global trust imperative survey. 20% said they’d prefer competitors over the offending company. 19% would stop doing business with the company temporarily. 19% would buy fewer products/services from the company. And 16% would warn friends and family to avoid the company completely.

Patagonia’s hang tag change was small but important, Patrick says.

“Patagonia is not Adidas or Nike,” she says. “This change is a small impact overall, but was a big impact for us.”

Patagonia ranks No. 205 in Digital Commerce 360’s database of the Top 1000 online retailers.

Patagonia uses technology to redirect customers

Packaging is set early on in the lifecycle of a piece of clothing, Patrick says. Before the change, editorial and design teams created content for each tag. Patagonia then printed the 453 tag designs and sent them to the factory floor. Once purchase orders came in, the tags were then attached and ready to go. With approximately 1,000 different clothing styles, it took too much time to ensure the right tags were on each style of clothing, she says.

Patrick created a time study and found that the new QR code inserts cut work time from 353 days to three days annually.

“It took 353 days, almost a year’s worth of our time spent on this process throughout the company,” Patrick says.

Retailers should challenge designers to use more technology and less materials, Patrick says.

“If retailers go more digital with information, it opens up the opportunity to save on materials — that saves us money.”

Think outside the box. Use technology to reduce single-use materials, she says.

“Use less and it’s not just a win from an environmental standpoint; it’s a financial win,” Patrick says.

https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-03/patagonia-ojai-ventura-county-sue-pine-mountain-forest-thinning-project,"Federal plan to thin forest on Pine Mountain draws lawsuits from Patagonia, Ojai and others","Pine Mountain, north of Ojai, provides a bird’s eye view of the sunrises and sunsets in Los Padres National Forest.

The popular Ventura-based clothing brand Patagonia, the city of Ojai, Ventura County and several environmental groups are suing the U.S. Forest Service in an attempt to stop a forest-thinning project on Pine Mountain in the Los Padres National Forest.

The Reyes Peak Forest Health and Fuels Reduction Project, first proposed in 2020, would thin and trim 755 acres of forestland, which the Forest Service says would alleviate firefighting risks.

But in lawsuits filed last week in federal court, plaintiffs say the project was improperly vetted, would damage the area’s flora, fauna and cultural history, and is a vestige of Trump administration logging initiatives.

“We don’t think there is much, if any, merit behind their proposal,” said Jeff Kuyper, executive director of Los Padres ForestWatch, an advocacy group that filed its suit with Patagonia, the Keep Sespe Wild Committee, the Earth Island Institute, the American Alpine Club, the Center for Biological Diversity and the California Chaparral Institute.

Ventura County and the city of Ojai filed their own suits.

Business Patagonia shows corporate activism is simpler than it looks From climate change to voting rights, Patagonia has been willing to risk backlash by taking positions on contentious social issues. It’s a risk that has paid off.

The forest-thinning project was immediately controversial, with conservation groups, local government officials and the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation opposing it.

“We’re fighting for our sacred sites in the face of what is continued colonization and imperialism,” Maura Sullivan, a representative for the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, told The Times in 2020.

“Pine Mountain is 90 minutes from our corporate headquarters,” said Patagonia spokesman J.J. Huggins. “It is a favorite location for our employees and our customers because of the outdoor recreation opportunities out there. ... It’s magical. It is a different realm of wildlife out there.”

The Forest Service declined to comment on the litigation, but agency officials defended the plan when it was first proposed, saying it was not a logging project.

“That location was designated because of insect and disease treatment,” Forest Service project manager Katherine Worn told The Times in 2020. “And it’s on a ridge top, and that’s where you would put a fuel break.”

In a 2020 letter outlining the scope of the project, Forest Service district ranger John Smith wrote: “Within the project area, there is a need to reduce surface and ladder fuels, reduce potential fire intensities and make the area more resilient to wildfire. The most appropriate fuel treatment strategy is often thinning (removing ladder fuels and decreasing crown density) followed by prescribed fire, piling and burning piled fuels.”

But conservation officials, and recent studies of California wildfires, find that justification flawed.

“If you look at the best science out there, it consistently told us that the best way to protect communities from wildfire is not to construct fuel breaks deep in the wilderness,” Kuyper said, adding that more effective strategies included retrofitting homes and structures to be more fire-resistant and developing and maintaining defensible space around structures.

Additionally, a Times investigation in 2019 found that fuel breaks were largely ineffective in stopping some of California’s deadliest wind-driven fires.

Plaintiffs also say the project was improperly vetted and pushed through in an attempt to meet logging quotas instituted under then-President Trump.

“There was a concerted effort by the previous administration to fast-track logging projects on our national forests, and this is certainly a byproduct of that,” Kuyper said.

The project was proposed under “categorical exclusions” that allowed the plan to forgo environmental assessments or environmental impact statements. The exclusions named by the Forest Service were insect and disease infestation and wildfire resilience.

Those exclusions and the lack of research into the environmental impacts of the project raised red flags for plaintiffs.

The city of Ojai’s “main concern is that the Forest Service made this decision regarding a significant amount of logging, without complying with applicable procedural requirements and without really assessing whether it’s necessary or helpful to the larger ecology and the larger environment,” said City Atty. Matthew Summers.

The extent of logging in the area would require road-building in the wilderness area, facilitating future logging and future developments, Summers said.

The Trump administration encouraged the use of the exclusions, or “loopholes” as Kuyper called them, to push through similar logging projects.

“It was basically them sending a strong message like, ‘Do whatever you have to do to approve these projects using the loophole even if it means you’ve got to be creative and stretch the bounds of the law,’ ” Kuyper said.","['Staff Writer', 'Christian Martinez Is A Metro Reporter Covering Breaking News At The Los Angeles Times.

Then one new discovery is right up your alley.

Reconstruction of the dinosaur. Image credits Juan Canale.

Researchers have discovered a new species of dinosaur with disproportionately short arms — just like those of the T. rex. Despite the similarity between the two, the new species christened Meraxes gigas, is not related to the infamous dinosaur. The two species evolved their tiny arms independently of one another, the team argues. Among the likely explanations for these tiny arms are potential functions such as supporting movement or easing the mating process.

Meraxes gigas belongs to the carcharodontosaurid family, discovered in modern-day Argentina, in the Winkul formation north of Patagonia. It is the most complete specimen of a carcharodontosaurid ever found in the Southern Hemisphere. The specimen is remarkably complete, including almost all the bones of its skull, cervical vertebrae, its shoulder girdle, alongside bones in the arms, pelvis, lower extremities, and several tail vertebrae.

This wealth of bones allowed the team to classify the finding as belonging to a new species.

New and short-armed

“The fossil of M. gigas shows never seen before, complete regions of the skeleton, like the arms and legs that helped us to understand some evolutionary trends and the anatomy of Carcharodontosaurids –the group that M. gigas belongs to,” says Juan Canale, project lead at Ernesto Bachmann Paleontological Museum in Neuquén, Argentina, and lead author of the paper describing the new species. “The fossil has a lot of novel information, and it is in superb shape,” says Canale. “We found the perfect spot on the first day of searching, and M. gigas was found,” Canale says, “It was probably one of the most exciting points of my career.”

The specimen likely lived up to the age of 45 years old, measured roughly 11 meters in length, and weighed in excess of four tons.

That being said, since we can’t directly observe the species’ behavior, it’s impossible to tell for sure whether these were just ornamentation or features that served a practical purpose.

M. gigas went extinct almost 20 million years before the emergence of T. rex, the team explains. It also hails from a very different branch of the tree of life, with the authors reporting that there is “no direct relationship” between the two species.

This implies that the evolution of short arms was, for both species, a matter of practicality. Based on the structure of their bones, the team is confident that the arms did not shrink because they served no role. Rather, in some way we’re not yet sure of, the development of shorter arms gave the beasts some sort of edge.

“I’m convinced that those proportionally tiny arms had some sort of function. The skeleton shows large muscle insertions and fully developed pectoral girdles, so the arm had strong muscles,” says Canale.

In other words, although the arms were short, they were quite powerful. Exactly what purpose they were meant to serve is harder to ascertain. Judging from the fossils of M. gigas and T. rex alike, the team determined that the larger the dinosaurs’ heads were, the smaller their arms grew. Since the arms were surely not involved in hunting — a behavior that the animal’s head and jaws served — Canale believes they were used for other purposes, such as holding a female during mating or providing leverage for the bipedal dinosaurs to stand back up when they fell.

[On the Torre Traverse with Colin Haley, 2008] That climb represented everything I had been working toward …. I started as a young kid from Argentina, visiting Patagonia in 1987 with borrowed gear and no contact with a bigger climbing community. I tried Cerro Torre for the first time in October 1989, when I was 18. We bailed. That year, [Ermanno] Salvaterra and his partners were making the first attempt of the Torre Traverse. So 20 years later, being the one that pulled it off was like closing a circle. The need to keep pushing myself to a great degree vanished.

***

For a while I thought my climbs were somewhat important contributions, little steps to push the sport forward. But when I took the foot off the accelerator and wrote the guidebook to the Chalten Massif, I realized that it was a far bigger contribution that anything I ever did climbing-wise. You think things are ascribed value in a certain way, but then all of a sudden you realize, Shit, I misjudged all of that.

***

For 20 years, basically, I soloed three or four times a week. In retrospect, if there was something I wouldn’t do in my life, it would be that. I can’t deny that it helped me and it served a purpose satiating my emotional hunger, but the risk-reward equation—it’s not worth it. Risk-taking is a readily available crutch, often used by young people, but one that we should not celebrate. There are so many other ways to add value to one’s life, to be creative.

There’s nothing worse than comedians that use topics such as sex to get laughs. It’s cheap and too easy. I think the use of risk to add value to your achievements is an equally poor creative tool.

***

[On the Piolets d’Or] Declaring winners and losers is reductive and unhelpful. Society would be better served with a different philosophy. Choosing winners is not a good way to have a contented, happy life, and is toxic in a risky activity such as alpinism. When every year several of the best die trying to push the bar, we need to rethink the goalposts to include renunciation and good decision-making as measures for success.

***

My experience in the Torre Traverse was less meaningful than the first tower I did in Patagonia—Aguja Guillaumet when I was 15 years old. The Traverse wasn’t a departure. That is what I’ve learned in my decades of climbing: Seeking a departure from what you know is the most meaningful thing you can do.

***

[On advocacy projects] I always thought it was important that climbers have a seat at the table when decisions are made. To do so, one needs to contribute, participate. You earn your seat. Climbers often take the anarchic position of hating “the man,” the national park in this case, but the entities that protect the things you love need to be your allies.

***

You can lose a game or fail on a climb and be perfectly satisfied if you feel like you gave it all or made a wise decision about dangers or conditions.

***

I am not a crystal-carrying hippie type. Everyone in my family above the age of 14 has a Ph.D. in science. When I developed MS [multiple sclerosis], I looked at the research and decided to take a secondary preventive approach rather than taking the drugs available. The costs and side effects of the drugs seemed worse than the benefits. Did I make the right decision? I will never know. It is a very complicated, variable disease, but taking agency and responsibility helped me cope, and I was able to continue my sporting career without it getting in the way.

***

[On making his diagnosis public] I thought it was important to share; that people would maybe benefit from knowing that a guy that soloed the Naked Edge and did the first ascent of the Torre Traverse was climbing with an MS diagnosis. Maybe it will empower people. I know it would have helped me.

***

In 2005, I walked up the Torre Valley for the first time post-diagnosis. All those mountains looked more beautiful than ever. It took a year to realize it was not a death sentence, and to learn to live with it. The next step was realizing I could return to the life and activities I was doing before, with no restrictions or limitations. I was so afraid that everything was going to be taken away from me, so when I got them back I enjoyed everything that much more.

***

In those years, the MS gave me a sense of urgency I hadn’t had before. Before, I had the attitude that many of us have— we live every day without realizing or acknowledging that we’ll never live that day again. The big driver behind the Torre Traverse and some of the other climbs in that period was the MS.

***

My record for the Tetons Grand Traverse stood for 16 years or something like that. The main reason I was happy about that day is because I had nothing more to give. By the time I was on the Middle Teton, I already knew I had at least an hour on Alex Lowe’s record. So I could have easily taken my foot off the gas. But I didn’t because I wanted never to have a single regret about it. I am surely glad for that. It is a day I will never forget.

Down Sweater: Which Is Best for You?,"Anyone who’s more than a cursory fan of Patagonia is probably familiar with the brand’s iconic Nano Puff Jacket. As the name describes, it’s a slimmed-down synthetic puffy that provides ample warmth and movement — one favored by climbers, hikers, travelers and athletes the world over. For some, it’s the minimal silhouette of the jacket that makes it appealing. For others, it’s the sustainability built into the garment by way of fair trade certifications, recycled materials and responsibly-sourced components. (Currently, the jacket is made from 100-percent recycled materials).

But...have you heard of the Patagonia Down Sweater Jacket? The arguably cozier, aesthetically-similar cousin to the famous Nano Puff? The Down Sweater Jacket is popular in its own right — but how does it compare to the Nano Puff?

I tried and tested both jackets to find out the answer to the question: which Patagonia jacket should you buy, the Nano Puff or the Down Sweater?

Patagonia Patagonia

(Nano) Puff Puff, Pass

We’ll start with the Nano Puff specs: it’s 11.9, ounces and features a synthetic 60-g PrimaLoft Gold Insulation Eco 100-percent post-consumer recycled polyester fill, as well as a 100-percent recycled polyester ripstop shell with DWR treatment. (Translation: it's windproof, waterproof, and very packable.)

At a cool $199, it’s not the most expensive jacket available _ but it's an investment piece to be sure, and will be a regular in your fall/winter/spring rotation for years to come. I wore the Nano Puff hiking local trails, running errands on brisk mornings and afternoons, and to keep me warm during my 5am morning coffee. In all cases, I found the jacket to be comfortable, lightweight and cozy.

Patagonia Patagonia

The Nano Puff's Best Attributes

The Nano Puff is versatile — it's inconspicuous enough that you can wear it out for dinner, but technical enough to warrant use in more extreme environments. I appreciated the upgraded functionality of standard features: the drawcord hem allowed me to seal in warmth on cooler days, and the handwarmer pockets include zippered closures when not in use. The entire jacket packs down into its own internal zippered chest pocket, which doubles as a stuff sack and includes a reinforced carabiner clip-in loop for easy carry.

Features I Can Live Without

I didn't love the collar on the Nano Puff: it felt a little restrictive, especially during activities with a lot of movement. The jacket is meant to be thin, but there were times it felt more minimal than protective.

Patagonia Patagonia

Let's Get Down (Jacket) to Business

Comparing specs across the two jackets, things look pretty similar on the surface, with a few key differences: the Down Sweater Jacket weighs 13.1 ounces, and features 800-fill-power Advanced Global Traceable Down fill as well as a center-front Vislon zipper, complete with wicking interior storm flap and zipper garage. At $229, it's pricier than the Nano Puff, but not by much.

I wore the Down Jacket for the same actives as listed above: a blend of athletic and outdoor pursuits, as well as everyday errands and activities. I found the Down Jacket to be a more plush, cozy experience. It's downright warm, and although it's less than two ounces heavier than the Nano Puff, it feels significantly more cushiony.

The Down Sweater Jacket's Best Attributes

The Down Sweater Jacket is responsibly made: the goose down is certified by NSF International, to help ensure the birds that supply the down are treated humanely and don't come to harm. The shell is made with 100% recycled polyester ripstop, with a DWR finish. The elastic cuffs on the sleeves aren't too tight, which can be an issue with similar jackets, and the adjustable hem is uniquely crafted; by pulling the cord in hand warmer pockets, you draw the hem in without having to fumble in the cold.

Features I Can Live Without

Patagonia's Down Jacket features a DWR treatment, which is industry standard, but I would have liked to see PFC-free waterproofing instead. The innovative adjustable system ended up being a pro in my book, but did take some getting used to; there was the smallest learning curve associated with the mechanism.

The Bottom Line: Which Should You Buy?

Both of Patagonia's jackets are popular for good reason: they're warm, affordable, long-lasting and have classic style. But if I had to pick between the two, I'd go for the Down Sweater Jacket.

Although the Nano Puff's synthetic insulation stands up to moisture and frequent packing better, there's not much that can replace the warmth and performance that comes from classic down. If you can only buy one Patagonia jacket this year, buy the Down Sweater Jacket.

https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-05-09/patagonia-shows-corporate-activism-is-simpler-than-it-looks,Patagonia shows corporate activism is simpler than it looks,"In 1990, Patagonia made a donation to Planned Parenthood, angering Christian fundamentalists. The response was swift: calls for a boycott, threats of store pickets and a deluge of complaints to its call center that jammed its phone lines.

The Ventura-based outdoor apparel retailer could have tried to placate the protesters. Instead, the company directed customer service representatives to respond: “Thank you so much for sharing your views. We want you to know that for every call like this we receive, we’re donating an additional $5 to Planned Parenthood.”

“The calls stopped pretty soon,” recalled Vincent Stanley, Patagonia’s director of philosophy.

And the sales, as usual, kept chugging along.

Politics has always been a minefield for businesses. But it used to be one they could avoid.

Three decades ago, it was all but unheard of for a major consumer brand to stake out a position on a hot-button culture war issue. Today, they’re increasingly finding such positions thrust on them by societal upheavals too big to simply ignore and activist customer bases demanding expressions of solidarity and meaningful action.

The rise of “conscious capitalism” has bred in younger consumers, particularly, an expectation that the companies seeking their dollars should share their values. Meanwhile, the hyper-partisan polarization of everything from sneakers to coffee means even “safe” causes can turn controversial in an instant, and silence is no refuge, with companies that avoid engaging on social issues apt to be tagged as complicit.

It’s all a little daunting for companies hoping to make sales, not headlines.

“The problem right now is you have businesses that are afraid,” said Marc Elias, a voting rights lawyer who works with Patagonia and other companies on their activism efforts. The instinct of most corporate leaders is to seek safety by staying with the herd and issuing only the blandest possible statements, he said. “It’s really unfortunate, because now is not the time for businesses to offer thoughts and prayers.”

The history of Patagonia suggests such risk aversion is unnecessary, if not outright counterproductive. The company has managed to pull off a high-wire act mixing business with activism throughout its 48-year history, its core business selling outdoor clothing seemingly bolstered by its progressive attitude and, at times, antics.

The retailer figured out a key lesson early: For all the corporate hand-wringing about losing customers, boycott threats are often limited to just that. If you make products that consumers want to buy, your brand can function as a political platform with little risk to the bottom line, brand strategists say. Even the free publicity of a backlash can be advantageous.

“People often ask, ‘Are you a for-profit business or are you an NGO?’” Patagonia Chief Executive Ryan Gellert said. “And the answer in my mind is yes; I think we’re some weird mashup of those two things. What we really are is a for-profit business, and we use the business to try to influence larger, more systemic issues.”

Boycotts, he said, are “just not something we think about.”

In the past, Patagonia’s advocacy was primarily focused on environmental causes. In 1985, it began donating 10% of its profit to conservation groups, which it later changed to 1% of all revenue. It sued President Trump after he announced plans to shrink national monuments in Utah. To discourage unnecessary consumerism, it has run ads asking people not to buy its products and is scaling back its lucrative business selling third-party logo gear to corporate clients (a move widely interpreted as Patagonia trying to distance itself from the banking and tech firms that love to slap their names on its fleece vests and puffy jackets).

But in a supercharged political environment, Patagonia has widened its scope. It pulled its ads off Facebook last year, citing the social media giant’s “spread of hateful lies and dangerous propaganda.” That was followed by a “Vote the Assholes Out” tag sewn into a line of men’s and women’s shorts ahead of the presidential election. A few weeks ago, the company donated $1 million to fight restrictive voting laws in Georgia.

The donation — along with an open letter by Gellert in which he pushed other CEOs to step up and “do more than make a corporate statement” — riled conservatives. Some called for a boycott on Twitter and told the retailer to stay out of politics. “You’ve decided to get woke so now you can go broke. So I guess it’s #boycottpatagonia time,” read one tweet.

Going broke doesn’t appear to be much of a risk at the moment. Executives at Patagonia, which is privately held with reported revenue of more than $1 billion annually, say there has never been a material sales decline when it has dabbled in contentious issues. It operates 36 stores in 19 states and Washington, D.C., and sells its products at more than 2,000 retailers worldwide.

“It’s worth losing a few customers — we always gain more when we take one of these positions,” spokesperson Corley Kenna said. Plus, a tweet pledging to boycott doesn’t automatically equal a lost sale: “Everyone says they’re a customer, but the truth is, if we had all of those customers, we’d be a lot bigger.”

Smoke without fire

Undeniably, straying from strictly business into politics carries a risk of negative attention. Republicans have been calling for boycotts of several major corporations that opposed the new Georgia voting laws, among them Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines. In years past, Chick-fil-A and Keurig faced scrutiny for espousing controversial stances through their donations or ad spending.

But whether the noisiness of the outcry corresponds to any economic activity is much less clear. Nike, one of the world’s most recognizable brands, was excoriated by conservatives three years ago when it released an ad featuring former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who helped start a movement of players kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice. “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything,” the caption read.

Despite the backlash, which included social media users posting photos of their Nike merchandise burning in trash cans, the company blew through sales projections during the quarter the campaign was released, with revenue increasing 10% to $9.4 billion.

“Over time, boycotts have not been an effective advocacy tool,” said Doug Hattaway, who works with businesses and nonprofits on their branding and advocacy strategies. Thinking otherwise may be “paying too much attention to the Twitterverse. … Companies should not fall into that.”

He said Patagonia has benefited from firm messaging over a long period, high-quality products with cachet, a loyal fan base and an unbending belief that what it’s doing is right. Those are especially important, brand strategists say, at a time when it’s difficult to discern which brands are merely saying what they think will help them keep or attract customers.

“We don’t take the stances that we take trying to monetize them; we’re also conversely not fearful of the outcomes on the business,” Gellert, the CEO, said. “The people that have a deep relationship with Patagonia understand who we are, what we stand for, and I think do appreciate that we’re willing to put our money, our voice, our name, our reputation on the line.”

Time and again, shooting from the political hip has paid off for Patagonia. Its “Vote the Assholes Out” labels were conceived and carried out by the company’s designers without the involvement of the leadership team; they sold out quickly.

Another snap decision was a promotion on Black Friday in 2016, shortly after Trump was elected, in which the company announced it would donate 100% of sales that day to grass-roots environmental groups.

“Ordinarily, we would have done about $2.5 million worldwide,” Stanley, the director of philosophy, said of typical day-after-Thanksgiving revenue. But that day, “we did $10 million — and about a third of the customers were new. So I think that if you define your values and you practice them consistently, which we have over time, I do think we’re making more friends than we’re losing by the stances we take.”

It’s a formula that Ben & Jerry’s has also employed to good effect. The two brands regularly share insights with each other as they’ve increased their advocacy work, said Chris Miller, the ice cream company’s head of global activism strategy.

“In order to get it right, root it in something real. Don’t try to appropriate a value that you think your consumers have,” he said. “Trying to thread a mushy middle and create something that’s inoffensive to everyone is a recipe for disaster. That’s how you really get it wrong.”

Like Patagonia, Ben & Jerry’s has put a cheeky twist on do-gooderism. In 2009, it temporarily changed the name of its Chubby Hubby ice cream to Hubby Hubby, along with a label featuring two men in tuxedos, to honor marriage equality in Vermont. It released a Pecan Resist flavor in 2018 in the run-up to the midterm elections and, a year later, a Justice ReMix’d flavor.

“The primary impact is it generates some calls,” Miller said. “This business has grown year over year for 43 years. I have no data to show you that when we take a position that that in any way hurts the business. It doesn’t mean that someone doesn’t walk into a scoop shop and say something insulting to a scooper. That has happened.”

Gellert, too, acknowledged that Patagonia hears more criticism than it used to.

“That’s a function of two things: one is this polarized environment. No. 2: social media,” he said. “There are more ways to communicate; there are more ways for people to share their opinions.”

But even those angry social media users who are genuine customers are unlikely to withhold their business over it. According to market research firm Global Web Index, only 1 in 3 people said they would commit to boycotting brands they feel are not socially responsible.

The new advocacy

On the rare instances when Patagonia has taken actions that didn’t jibe easily with its reputation for upholding progressive principles, it hasn’t generated much heat. The company’s Lost Arrow Project, which produces tactical outerwear and protective equipment for the U.S. military on a contract basis, has attracted only desultory criticism.

“I wish Patagonia didn’t contribute to the military industrial complex,” wrote one commenter on a Reddit thread, while a National Review article last fall noted: “Some of Patagonia’s more stridently liberal customers, who see the U.S. military as an inherently imperialistic or destructive force, might not see the company’s military contracts as a sin that they can excuse or forgive.”

Patagonia executives dismissed the notion of a contradiction and downplayed Lost Arrow Project’s significance.

“The size of that business is a rounding error in the totality of what we do,” Gellert said. “But yeah, that is a piece of our footprint.”

Another outdoor brand, Trek Bicycle, was faced with boycott threats last year over its contracts to supply police departments. After the police killing of George Floyd, officers at several Black Lives Matter rallies were captured on video using their bikes to batter protesters.

Although Trek responded by saying that it was committed to addressing systemic racism and that its bikes had been “used by police in ways that are abhorrent,” it didn’t commit to winding down its police business: “We believe bikes can play a positive role by continuing to get officers out of cars and armoured trucks and into the community where trust can be built.” Still, a year later (helped by the pandemic), Trek sales are up hugely, with the company saying on its website that it is “building twice as many now as we did in the previous year.” (Trek did not return a call for comment.)

Rather than worry about potential boycotts, Patagonia’s executives are wrestling with the question of when to get involved, Kenna, the spokesperson, said.

“We live in a world of overlapping crises and everything is intersecting, so it opens the door of, OK, are we speaking out on all these issues? We haven’t figured that out perfectly,” she said. “For a long time, we did look at the world as siloed problems, but they’re not siloed. That’s part of the new advocacy. It really makes how companies communicate on these topics more complicated.”

Skeptics have pointed to the rise in corporate activism as nothing more than virtue signaling, which Gellert said he accepted as fair criticism.

“People are right to be cynical about the intentions of business, period, and if you want to be cynical about the intentions of our business, that’s fine — that’s probably a healthy, natural posture to start with,” he said. “I accept that people will try to create a narrative that’s inaccurate. But we’re going to continue to show up and engage.”","['Staff Writer', 'Andrea Chang Is A Wealth Reporter For The Los Angeles Times.

https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/28/business/patagonia-ceo-facebook-boycott/index.html,Patagonia CEO: Companies should join us in boycotting Facebook,"CNN Business —

In the wake of the revelations in the Facebook Papers, Patagonia CEO Ryan Gellert on Thursday called for companies to join the brand in pressuring Facebook to fix its platforms.

“We believe Facebook has a responsibility to make sure its products do no harm, and until they do, Patagonia will continue to withhold our advertising,” Gellert said in a statement to CNN. “We encourage other businesses to join us in pushing Facebook to prioritize people and planet over profit.”

In the summer of 2020, Patagonia joined a growing list of companies pulling ads from Facebook (FB) platforms as part of an advertiser boycott.

“Patagonia stopped all paid advertising on Facebook platforms in June 2020 because they spread hate speech and misinformation about climate change and our democracy. We continue to stand by that boycott 16 months later,” Gellert said.

The comments come after a consortium of 17 US news organizations began publishing articles based on the Facebook Papers, a trove of hundreds of internal documents that were included in disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided to Congress in redacted form by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen’s legal counsel. The consortium, which includes CNN, reviewed the redacted versions received by Congress.

CNN’s coverage includes stories about how coordinated groups on Facebook sow discord and violence, including on January 6, as well as Facebook’s challenges moderating content in some non-English-speaking countries, and how human traffickers have used its platforms to exploit people.

The Patagonia CEO expressed concern about the revelations.

“The internal Facebook documents released over the last few weeks have made it incredibly clear that they know the irreparable damage that their lack of accountability causes their three billion users and the corrosive effects that has on society itself,” Gellert said. “Facebook’s executives know what steps it can take to mitigate such harm — yet they have repeatedly failed to reform.”",['Matt Egan'],2021-10-28 00:00:00
https://wyofile.com/patagonia-dumps-jackson-hole-ski-resort-after-far-right-fundraiser/,Patagonia dumps Jackson Hole ski resort after far-right fundraiser,"Patagonia, the iconic sportswear company that’s built a worldwide reputation on outdoor athleticism and environmental activism, will no longer supply Jackson Hole Mountain Resort with its products after a resort owner hosted a fundraiser for the right-wing House Freedom Caucus.

Patagonia confirmed Tuesday that it would no longer sell to the resort, its largest single customer in the Jackson Hole area. The resort company operates retail stores in Teton Village at the base of the ski area, as well as Hoback Sports and the Jackson Hole Resort Store in nearby Jackson.

The move came after Jay Kemmerer, one of the resort’s owners, co-hosted a fundraiser Aug. 5, 2021, at a posh Jackson hotel for the House Freedom Caucus. U.S. Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia), former Trump White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) headlined the event. Admission to the event cost a minimum of $2,000 per couple.

The three have parroted the former president’s false claims of election fraud and been panned by conservation groups for their environmental records. Patagonia and the caucus also diverge on social priorities like voting rights and advocacy for minorities and disadvantaged groups, according to widely reported public positions.

Patagonia’s decision centered on “our really strong commitment to using both our business and our brand to advocate for our strong priorities,” said Corley Kenna, head of communications and policy at Patagonia. “When there’s a misalignment on that, then we take action.

The resort president said Jackson Hole is committed to environmental action.

“JHMR retail will continue to offer world-class brands across our retail locations with the aim to provide the best service and product assortment for our guests,” president Mary Kate Buckley said in a statement. “We have been a leader in the ski industry in adopting initiatives to reduce our energy consumption, recycle the consumables used by our employees and guests, and treat the spectacular natural habitat which surrounds us with vision and care.

“We are proud to be the largest mountain resort operating on 100% wind today,” the statement reads. “We will remain focused on operating a world-class mountain resort and protecting the health and safety of our guests and employees.”

Kemmerer’s fundraiser drew a gaggle of protesters, some of whom suggested that skiers and others should no longer support the world-class ski area by buying ski passes or otherwise engaging in business with it, according to reporting by the Jackson Hole News&Guide. One protester, Jorge Colon, said he was willing to cancel the season ski pass he bought to access the expansive ski area, which is internationally known for long runs and radical terrain.

“It’s just a shame that it’s gotten to this point,” Colon, an active septuagenarian who has worked various jobs at the ski area over the decades, told WyoFile. “I know they supply a lot of people with work, but to be backing up that group…is pretty embarrassing.”

Profits vs. priorities

Resort management has struggled to separate itself and its operations from Kemmerer’s political views. Members of the corporation’s board published an opinion piece in the local paper touting the company’s own environmental priorities and its commitment to the community and guests and the welcoming of a diversity of views.

Patagonia’s Kenna acknowledged a “long and strong relationship” with the “workers and the management team at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, if not Kemmerer himself.

“It’s very fair to say that Jackson Hole is a really important community for us,” she said. “We have several [sports] ambassadors that live there. Plenty of my colleagues enjoy going there and appreciate all that the area has to offer,” including the natural environment.

Kenna would not disclose how much business Patagonia does with the ski and resort company.

“It is our largest customer in an area — that’s really critical,” she said. “That tells you something about the importance of this relationship. We don’t take ending it lightly.”

The House Freedom Caucus formed in 2015, and both Jordan and Meadows led it at one time. The caucus and the three fundraising conservatives hold views that are at loggerheads with Patagonia’s ethics.

Jordan and former U.S. Rep. Meadows received 3% and 2% scores respectively for their votes on conservation issues from the League of Conservation Voters. The House stripped Greene of her committee assignments in February for “spreading dangerous and bigoted misinformation,” according to a characterization by The New York Times.

“It’s a shame that those people are doing what they’re doing,” Colon said of Kemmerer, “especially when we know as much as we know today. You can’t get away with that shit in Teton County,” he said of the fundraiser.

Patagonia has undertaken other boycotts, but is willing to reconsider its withdrawal from the mountain resort, Kenna said. If owners recommit to priorities “especially protecting the planet,” Patagonia would “consider sitting down and talking through that,” she said.

“This is very much about staying true to our strong feeling and our responsibility as a benefit corporation to stand up for and advance our priorities, our policies to protect our planet and our communities,” Kenna said.","['Angus M.

On Wednesday, crews were able to get line in on the western, eastern and southern flanks of the fire.

The fire is currently at 11,620 acres and is 62% contained, the news release said. An estimated 165 ground personnel remain assigned with aircraft on standby as some resources have been reassigned to provide for initial attack should a new incident start nearby.

Due to the increased containment, the Southeast Zone Incident Management Team will transition the fire back to the department of forestry and fire management and the Coronado National Forest on Friday morning.

Forest Road 799 and the Arizona Trail from Parker Canyon Lake to Harshaw Road remain closed for public and firefighter safety. All residential areas have also returned to ""Ready"" status.

The San Rafael Fire started on Saturday and pushed nearly 12 miles to the northeast due to high winds and a dry grass crop, the news release said. A corral at San Rafael State Natural Area was damaged at the start of the fire.

The cause of the fire remains under investigation.

https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2021/09/24/patagonia-politics-activism,Patagonia CEO On Aligning Company Values And Taking Activist Stances — No Matter The Cost,"If you're traveling to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, this winter, you won't see any Patagonia gear at the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort stores.

The company has pulled its vests and jackets after a co-owner of the resort hosted a right-wing fundraiser with, among others in attendance, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Patagonia has long taken activist stances to encourage what the company says is a new brand of capitalism. The move to cut ties with a business owner who gave a platform to “anti-democratic conspiracy theorists” aligns with other decisions the company has made, CEO Ryan Gellert says, such as turning off paid advertisements on Facebook and Instagram for the last year and a half.

“I know that there's this temptation to make it about politics or one politician,” he says. “It's really about standing up to misinformation and hate speech.”

The decision turned away many long-time Patagonia customers. Gellert received letters and products back in response. He wants people to understand the company’s motivations.

“We're not an extension of the Democratic Party. We're not anti-Republican Party,” he says. “But there are elements that we feel like are just totally incompatible with our values.”

Years ago, Michael Jordan famously chose not to take sides in a political issue. And at the time, he said “Republicans buy sneakers, too.”

Patagonia has outgrown this outdated business model that focuses solely on maximizing profit for shareholders, Gellert says. He believes businesses need values and a greater purpose.

“If you are a business and your sole reason for existing is making money and offering product to as big a slice of humanity as possible, I suppose that does make sense,” he says. “That's not our reason for being.”

In a seminal article from 1970, economist Milton Friedman argues that, “The discussions of the ‘social responsibilities of business’ are notable for their analytical looseness and lack of rigor.”

Gellert says the company spends a lot of time considering what’s at stake in deciding to take a particular stance.

“We really try to challenge ourselves not to run from tough decisions when we feel like they need to be made,” he says.

Over the past 48 years, Patagonia has taken positions on environmental issues and recently more social issues that play a role in protecting the planet, he says. The company joined others such as Lyft and Madewell in opposing Texas’s new abortion law in a statement from the American Civil Liberties Union.

Though Gellert doubts the statement will change minds in today’s polarized world, that’s not all that matters to him. Patagonia employees in Texas expressed frustration and anger about the law, so he says the company felt obliged to take a position.

“We were shocked by a law that is effectively trying to restrict women's rights,” he says. “And the way they've done it, I think, is particularly disturbing.”

Gellert believes Patagonia is espousing a better capitalism through its consistent efforts to protect the environment.

The company vocally supports voting rights because of its critical role in protecting the planet, he says. Patagonia co-founded a campaign in 2018 that targets low voter turnout called Time to Vote.

“These issues — even if they're a little bit further removed from the obvious place for us to contribute — I think are foundationally important to the broader mission,” he says.

Patagonia encourages customers not to buy too much on Black Friday and instead spend time outside. But economists say the impact of decisions by individual consumers aren’t comparable to changes in policy and finance when it comes to climate change.

The scale of the climate crisis requires government leadership to find solutions, he says, but individuals also need to do what they can as a part of society. And the business sector needs to step up in ways such as Patagonia’s support for the environment-focused parts of the budget reconciliation and raising corporate taxes to fund climate initiatives.

“Ultimately we've created problems that are large enough, complex enough and existential in their threat to humanity that I think we're going to have to use all the levers in society to get there,” he says. “And I think business is arguably the biggest lever.”

Business has seen a sea change around its approach to and investment in the climate crisis — something that encourages Gellert. But these shifts only represent a small portion of what’s needed to save the planet, he says.

And for Gellert — a lifelong nature lover and father of two young kids — the issue of climate change is a personal one.

“It's hard for me to imagine anybody that's not lying in their deathbed with no heirs that find this anything but personal,” he says.

https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/081022_patagonia_lake_mercury/,"Catfish from Patagonia Lake have elevated mercury levels, Az officials warn","Anglers should limit their consumption of catfish from Patagonia Lake because of elevated levels of mercury, state officials announced Wednesday.

Recent analyses of fish tissue showed high levels of the chemical, prompting an advisory about Flathead Catfish caught in the lake in Santa Cruz County from Arizona Department of Environmental Quality and the Arizona Game and Fish Department.

""To protect the health of everyone who enjoys eating fish caught in Arizona waters, ADEQ tests filets of sampled fish for mercury and other pollutants of concern to recommend healthy amounts of fish species to catch and eat,"" officials said in a news release.

Adults should limit the amount of Flathead Catfish hauled in from Patagonia Lake to 2.5 ounces per week, ADEQ said. Children under 12 shouldn't eat more than 2 ounces per month.

Native to the lower Great Lakes and Mississippi River Basin, the Flathead Catfish was introduced to Arizona in the 1940s. The catfish is dark-brown or yellow-brow and has a yellowish-white belly, according to Game and Fish.

Patagonia Lake is a man-made reservoir about 50 miles southwest of Tucson, and is part of the state park system.

State officials said mercury can come from ""various sources."" Mercury is a common element in nature, and naturally occurs in rock, soil and water, said ADEQ. Additionally, abandoned mines, established before the development of modern mining practices ""can be major contributors to mercury in the environment.""

Some industrial and manufacturing processes, including some mining activities can put mercury into the atmosphere, ADEQ said. The element can also be released into the air by fossil fuel burning, as well as when municipal solid waste or medical waste is incinerated, ADEQ said.

""Mercury in lakes is common throughout the United States and can be deposited in bodies of water far from the source through atmospheric deposition, meaning tiny particles of mercury settle out of the air and into the water or are deposited through rain- and snowfall,"" said ADEQ.

Mercury accumulates in fish because it ""binds to muscle or fat with levels building up in the tissue over time"" in a process known as bioaccumulation, and larger fish can accumulate elevated levels of mercury by eating smaller fish and insects, ADEQ said.

""Generally, contaminant levels found in water are significantly lower than those found in fish tissue,"" said ADEQ.

In 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency released a nationwide advisory for freshwater fish, warning women who are pregnant, or may become pregnant, as well as nursing mothers and young children to limit eating fish. The EPA said ""sensitive adults"" should eat just 6 ounces of cooked fish, or 8 ounces uncooked, of fish per week. And, young children should eat no more than 2 ounces of cooked fish, or 3 ounces uncooked, per week.

State officials said there are two ""Green Light"" fish at the lake that have been tested and do not show the same levels of mercury as the lake's catfish.

The Redear Sunfish and the Bluegill can be eaten may be eaten without limits under standard dietary guidelines.

State officials said despite the warning fishing, bird watching and ""other recreational activities"" at Patagonia Lake ""are not affected by this advisory and are encouraged for enjoying the great outdoors.""","['Paul Ingram', ""Teachers At Tucson'S Basis Charter School Overwhelmingly Vote To Form Union"", 'Photos', ""Good Friday Procession Carries Cross Up Tucson'S A Mountain"", 'Az State Board Moves Toward Pulling Certification Of Ex-Cop For Shooting Tucson Man In Wheelchair', 'Rally In Downtown Tucson For Transgender Day Of Visibility', ""Ua Faculty Votes 'No Confidence' In Robbins Over Meixner Slaying""]",

For many years, the name Explora has been synonymous with Patagonia, the vast wilderness region at the tip of South America that straddles the neighboring countries of Chile and Argentina. This area has long been one of the grand prizes of travel for intrepid adventurers and Explora set the gold standard for South American wilderness retreats when they opened their first lodge here in 1993.

The company currently operates seven remote luxury lodges in South America and three of those lodges are located in Patagonia. Now Explora has come up with a way to link all three properties in Chilean and Argentinean Patagonia on a series of seamless Explora Connects Super Itineraries. Combining options for stays at multiple Explora lodges in Chilean Patagonia and Argentinian Patagonia, with transportation between them via air or car transfer, the Super Itineraries offer a chance to explore different parts of this region at the southern tip of South America.

The itineraries promise 8-12 days of immersive travel in Patagonia, combining Torres del Paine and Patagonia National Park in Chilean Patagonia, and the Southern Patagonia Ice Field region in Argentinian Patagonia.

Founded back in 1993, Explora opened its first lodge, Explora Torres del Paine, along Lake Pehoé in the heart of Torres Del Paine National Park in Chile. They created a recipe for a stay in an adventure lodge that included creature comforts and exploration, in this case of the adjacent UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve, via guided hikes, horseback rides, overland drives, and catamaran. It’s a formula that has been incredibly successful for them and much copied in wilderness lodges around the world.

Explora Connects utilizes three lodges, including this original one, Explora Torres del Paine, with its jaw-dropping view of its namesake mountain peaks. Horseback riding, hiking, Overlanding and high mountain treks are on offer.

The 10-room Explora Patagonia National Park will soon have 17 rooms and reopens in October 2022 ... [+] after an extension of the lodge. Explora

Explora Patagonia National Park opened in 2021 in the Aysen region of Chilean Patagonia. The new lodge offers access to remote wilderness and protected wildlife via 32 crafted explorations. The culinary exploration is courtesy of Pablo Jesús Rivero and Guido Tassi, owner, and consulting chef, respectively, of Don Julio in Buenos Aires. At this lodge, Explora has taken on the role of managing the 640,000 acres of Patagonia National Park, collaborating with Rewilding Chile and CONAF.

The third and newest lodge is Explora El Chaltén, which opened at the end of 2021 in Argentinian Patagonia. Set within a natural amphitheater surrounded by ancient forests, rivers, glaciers and mountains, the lodge offers 30 explorations, including hikes, rock climbing, e-mountain biking, and kayaking.

There are three Explora Connects itineraries in Patagonia, all with transportation between lodges via air or ground included.

Chilean Patagonia combines stays at Explora Patagonia National Park and Explora Torres del Paine via bi-directional flights. Air transportation between the two lodges is just 1 hour and 40 minutes or less versus 24 hours on a commercial flight. From $10,960 per person, for 8 nights, all-inclusive.

Boundless Patagonia combines Explora El Chaltén and Explora Torres del Paine via an 8-hour car transfer of 283 miles. In this case, that’s still a significant savings of time over a commercial connecting flight across the border of Chile and Argentina. From $9,680 per person, for 8 nights, all-inclusive.

Deep Patagonia combines stays at all three lodges – Explora Torres del Paine, Explora Patagonia National Park, and Explora El Chaltén – via air transportation in Chilean Patagonia and car transfer across the border into Argentinian Patagonia. From $15,610 per person, for 12 nights, all-inclusive.

In classic Explora fashion, the company takes care of all details for travelers on Explora Connects itineraries, including flight reservations, airport transfers, and car transfers between Chile and Argentina. The season runs from October 3, 2022, through April 10, 2023. Visit Explora for more details.","['Everett Potter', 'Amy Danise']",2022-04-20 00:00:00
https://fortune.com/2021/11/02/patagonia-doesnt-use-the-word-sustainable-cop26/,Patagonia doesn’t use the word ‘sustainable.’ Here’s why,"UN climate summits used to be the preserve of policy wonks and heads of state, with perhaps a few campaigners and scientists on the fringe. But today, conversations on climate have entered the public consciousness, and we have been forced, by a courageous Swedish 18-year-old, to acknowledge that our house is on fire. And, suddenly, COP26 achieves a level of hype nearing that of Glastonbury Festival, with businesses of all sizes and leanings making it an integral part of the calendar.

It may feel jarring to witness the corporate encroachment at the upcoming talks in Glasgow, but it’s no surprise. Persistent corporate lobbying against climate policy is no secret. Even so, it is a mistake to write off the positive impact that for-profit businesses can have. Not because they’re saints (none are, Patagonia included). And not because they have all the answers (others might; we certainly don’t). But without the private sector committing to becoming part of the solution rather than the problem, we have no hope of saving our home planet.



For businesses ourselves, the first step must be taking a long hard look in the mirror. The private sector faces a massive—and understandable—trust deficit on the back of widespread greenwashing, spin, and straight out lying. Therefore, we must get a clear picture of our impact and use this to open honest conversations.

At Patagonia, we don’t use the word “sustainable.” Why? Because we recognize we are part of the problem. Previously, we set ourselves the target of carbon neutrality by 2025. But purchasing offsets to get us there doesn’t erase the footprint we create and won’t save us in the long run. We must first put the weight of our business behind drastically cutting emissions across the full length of our supply chain.

What is unsettling is that, right now, we aren’t entirely sure how to do this. Our pledge to use only renewable or recycled materials in our products by 2025 is a case in point. We have spent years of work on this, and our recycled content is now up to 68% of our total usage—still not enough. Investigating all the options, from upweighting the sale of secondhand products to moderating growth and cutting the breadth of our product line, only reinforces our belief that we can’t do this alone.

The biggest problem here is that 95% of our emissions come from our supply chain, and we are a minor player on this stage. We produce in shared factories, often alongside much larger brands. So, we’ve had to innovate. We are developing an “insetting” approach in our supply chain by setting up a joint funding mechanism where other smaller brands can partner with us to invest in “greening” the factories in exchange for carbon credits. As is the case for many of our progressive ideas, we currently have only a hunch that it will work, but we know we have to try.



This approach intrinsically fits our values: innovating and finding solutions from which we, and other businesses, can benefit, then sharing this learning as widely as possible, in order to scale practical solutions to the crisis we face.

If accountability and innovation are the first two steps, the ultimate action we must take to deliver on a real climate strategy is to give back more than we take. Businesses wield enormous influence, and we must jointly demand that governments play their part in doing what is right for the whole of society, and support them in this aim.

Patagonia has gone above and beyond in many ways, for many years. For example, we support grass-roots activists fighting for nature around the world. We challenge unnecessary consumption, through actions such as our 2011 Black Friday ad in the New York Times, titled “Don’t Buy This Jacket.” What is new for us is the combined sense of urgency that comes from working with other like-minded businesses to demand change.

Our message to policymakers in Glasgow this month is clear: Set global standards for carbon accounting and offsetting. Right now, it’s wild out there, with a lack of clarity that just feeds greenwashing and delays meaningful action.

And our message to businesses? Join us in cutting through the blah, blah. Our voices are stronger when we speak together, such as with the B Corp movement or the open letter we cosigned in support of Joe Biden’s Build Back Better Act.



People are right to be wary of companies declaring their support for climate action. Much of it will be mere posturing—but not all. Genuine corporate climate champions do exist.

You might just be one yourself.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-09272-z,"A large Megaraptoridae (Theropoda: Coelurosauria) from Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) of Patagonia, Argentina","Some bones of holotype of Maip macrothorax (D12 or 13) have been previously described by Novas et al.3, thus we refer readers to this paper for descriptions and figures of those elements. Novas et al.3 described an isolated dorsal centrum of Maip, which is interpreted here as D12 or 13 based on a combination of characters (large size, strong transverse constriction, notably transversely wide anterior articular surface) observed in D13 of Aerosteon14.

Axial skeleton

Based on comparisons with the complete cervico-dorsal sequence preserved in a juvenile specimen of Megaraptor namunhuaiquii10, and holotypes of Aerosteon riocoloradensis14,34, Murusraptor barrosaensis12,33, and Tratayenia rosalesi19, the cervico-dorsal series of Maip macrothorax is represented by the axis (Fig. 2), dorsal vertebrae 2–7, 9, 10 or 11, and 12–13 (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). All vertebrae are camellated, as observed in many vertebrae because of the presence of broken areas exposing the internal structure of the bone. Only three caudal vertebrae are currently known for Maip macrothorax, and all are from the proximal third of the tail, thereby enabling comparison with the proximal caudals of Megaraptor namunhuaiquii10, Orkoraptor burkei35, and Aerosteon riocoloradensis14,34. The holotype of Maip macrothorax also preserves several ribs tentatively referred as cervical ribs 5, 7 and 8 (Fig. 10), and dorsal ribs 1, 2, and 6, as well as many other indeterminate rib fragments (Fig. 11). Many lateral and medial gastral elements have been recovered, probably belonging to the anterior half of the chest (Fig. 12).

Axis

As observed in other megaraptorids, Maip macrothorax exhibits proportionately dorsoventrally low axis as compared with posterior dorsal vertebrae, which are twice the height of the anterior cervical vertebrae. The axis is almost complete (Fig. 2), only lacking both prezygapophyses and its right postzygapophysis. In lateral view (Fig. 2A), it is taller than long, with the neural arch almost two times the height of the centrum. The neural spine is low but robust, being less than half the height of the neural arch. The intercentrum exhibits a rugose texture; it is placed ventral (not anterior) to the pleurocentrum, and immediately ventral to the parapophyses. The intercentrum is subtriangular in lateral view, and shows a moderate dorsolateral projection. Anteriorly, the intercentrum is crescent-shaped and anteriorly concave; it is subtriangular shaped in contour in ventral view. The pleurocentrum shows an irregular anterior surface, the odontoid process being damaged. The pleurocentrum is squared-shaped in lateral view, being slightly taller than long. It is laterally concave and shows an anteroposteriorly long, deep oval depression, perforated by a single pneumatopore on each side of the centrum. The centrum is rounded and moderately posteriorly concave. The posterior articular surface is wider than its anterior counterpart. The parapophyses are small, oval in contour (dorsoventrally taller than anteroposteriorly long), slightly concave and placed on the anterior margin of centrum.

The neurocentral suture is irregular. The transverse process is short, ventrolaterally oriented and close to the anterior margin of the vertebra. A moderately developed, obliquely oriented PODL is observed. This crest delimits a PO-CDF which exhibits a single pneumatic opening on its center. The postzygapophyses are concave and anteroposteriorly long in lateral view; in posterior aspect each is notably mediolaterally wide, with its articular surface ventrally concave and strongly laterally projected. The postzygapophyses bear oval (wider than long) articular surfaces. The TPOL is stout and dorsally concave. Posteriorly, the neural arch shows a deep and anteroposteriorly long SPOF. This pneumatic fossa is deep and subtriangular-shaped. The SPOL are stout, dorsally concave and reach the tip of the neural spine. The SPOL diverges posteriorly.

The epipophyses are stout, dorsoventrally low, and mediolaterally wide. They are subtriangular in side view, and posteriorly do not surpass the posterior level of centrum. In anterior view, the neural canal is subtriangular, but it is oval and notably wider than tall in posterior view. The latter is dorsoventrally short but transversely wide. The neural spine is square-shaped and low in side aspect. The anterior margin of the neural spine is broken, but it is evident that it is much thinner than the posterior margin, conferring a subtriangular cross-section to the neural spine. The intervertebral ligament rugosity is weak.

Dorsal vertebrae

The transverse process of all dorsal neural arch (except the D9) is upturned (30° from the horizontal axis), mainly oriented perpendicular to the sagittal axis and, in dorsal view, the anterior and posterior margins of the transverse process are subparallel resulting in a subrectangular process. All vertebrae shows well-developed laminae and fossae. Below the transverse process, all vertebrae shows the same structures (but with different shape, sizes, and orientations). The PRDL (anteriorly) and the PODL (posteriorly) connects the transverse process with the pre- and postzygapophyses, respectively. Below the transverse process, are observed the ACDL and PCDL (in the D9 the ACDL is substantially reduced). These four mentioned laminae, delimits three fossae: the PR-CDF (anterior), the CDF (middle and below) and the PO-CDF (posterior). Almost all vertebrae, shows pneumatopores invading the bone on these fossae. Anteriorly, the neural archs shows the CPRL which delimits medioventrally the CPRF. The neural spine has, on its anterior side, the PRSL and, posteriorly, the SPOL. The former delimits the PRSF and the SPOL delimits the SPOF.

Dorsal 2.

It is represented by an incomplete neural arch (Fig. 3). The neural spine and the right transverse process are only preserved at its base.

This element is referred to D2 because of the presence of a strong and laterally facing PR-CDF, prominent CPRL, parapophyses placed partially on the centrum and transverse process anterior oriented, as also occurs in D2 of Megaraptor namunhuaiquii10 and Murusraptor barrosaensis12,33.

The neurocentral suture is ventrally convex. Only the roof of the parapophysis is placed in the neural arch indicating its anterior position on the column. The articular surface of the parapophysis is concave. In lateral view, the left transverse process is sub-horizontally oriented because of breakage, whereas the left process is dorsally oriented, which seems to be its original morphology. In dorsal view, the transverse process is anteroposteriorly long, and slightly posteriorly oriented. On its posterior surface, this process shows a deep and oval pneumatic opening located at its mid-length. The PR-CDF is subtriangular and pneumatic in nature. The CDF is subtriangular in shape and ventrally facing. This fossa is asymmetric, being pneumatic on the left side and apneumatic on the right. The PCDL is stout and obliquely oriented. The PO-CDF is deep and probably pneumatic. The transverse process shows a big, round, concave and laterally (or slightly ventrolaterally) facing diapophysis. The postzygapophyses face posteroventrally and are placed slightly below the prezygapophyses. In ventral view, the articular surface of the postzygapophyses is oval (wider than long) in contour and flat or slightly concave. More dorsally, the SPOLs are notably thick and stout. The SPOF is subrectangular in shape and exhibits subtle intervertebral ligament tuberosity. Furthermore, the SPOF is deep and shows a step-like convexity on its lateroventral corner. This feature is observed in other anterior dorsals of Maip but absent in more posterior elements. The prezygapophyses are strongly anterior- or anterodorsally facing. Its articular surfaces are round, flat and slightly medially inclined. The PRDL is sharp, sub-horizontally oriented and ventrally concave. In anterior view, the PRSF is deep and strongly pneumatic. This fossa shows a wide pneumatic recess that communicates with at least three pneumatic foramina that penetrate the bone. Ventral to the prezygapophyses, the CPRL is laterally convex and there is an oval shaped and pneumatic CPRF. This fossa is delimited medially by a sharp margin. The base of the neural spine is transversely wide. The intervertebral ligament tuberosity is weak, and becomes progressively transversely wider towards the top of the neural spine.

Dorsal 3.

This element preserves a partial neural arch with a right transverse process (Fig. 4 A-E). The postzygapophyses are partially preserved. The neural spine is broken but some fragments are observed at the base of the transverse process.

This element is interpreted as a possible D3 based on the presence of a subhorizontally oriented transverse process (similar to D3 of Murusraptor and D2 of Maip; the transverse process of D4 is more dorsally oriented in Aerosteon), proximodistally short transverse process (shorter than D4 of Aerosteon but comparable to D3 of Murusraptor), laterally oriented transverse process in dorsal view (similar to D3 of Murusraptor but contrasting with the anteriorly projected process of D2 of Maip), and anteroposteriorly expanded tips of the transverse process (similar to D3 of Murusraptor).

The transverse process is less dorsally upturned than in more posterior vertebrae. The transverse process is dorsally subrectangular in contour but expands transversely close to its tip; this condition does not occur in more posterior dorsals. This process is proximodistally short when compared with more posterior vertebrae. The dorsal surface is smooth with some thin longitudinal striations and some rugosities close to its tip. The articular surface of the diapophyses faces ventrally. The postzygapophysis shows a nearly flat articular surface. Dorsal to it, the base of the SPOL is stout and medially concave. The SPOF is deep and shows a step (as in D2 but contrasting with D6). The PO-CDF is poorly preserved but shows, immediately anterior to the postzygapophyses, a deep penetrating pneumatopore.

Dorsal 4.

It is represented by an isolated centrum (Fig. 4F–I). This element is identified as the fourth because part of the parapophysis is placed in the neural arch, a single squared or round pneumatopore, as well as the absence of a ventral keel, a condition retained in the first dorsal elements of theropods (such as D1 of Aerosteon;14,34). Furthermore, this interpretation is tentative giving the lack of articulated dorsal columns in non-juvenile megaraptorid specimens.

The centrum is round or subrectangular being slightly dorsoventrally taller than anteroposteriorly long and with sub-parallel anterior and posterior surfaces. Its ventral and lateral margins are shallowly concave. The posterior articular surface of the centrum is incompletely preserved but seems to be deeply concave, which suggests that the centrum was opisthocoelous. The anterior articular surface of centrum is almost flat and slightly taller than wide. The ventral margin lacks a keel or longitudinal groove, is mostly smooth, and has a strongly rugose anterior surface. The lateral surface of the centrum is longitudinally concave and smooth. At mid-height it shows a deep and round pneumatopore, placed within a shallow pneumatic fossa. Anteriorly, the parapophyses is ovoidal in contour, dorsoventrally taller than anteroposteriorly long. The parapophyses show a rugose surface that might represent the attachment some ligament.

Dorsal 5.

This vertebra is represented by a fragmentary neural arch, preserving the right prezygapophysis and the base of the right transverse process (Fig. 5A, C–E). It is interpreted as a D5 because of the presence of an ACDL stouter than in D6, a slightly bigger CDF than in D6, and a slightly smaller parapophysis than that present in D6.

In lateral view, the bases of both CDL can be observed. Whereas the base of the PCDL is robust, the ACDL is gracile (albeit not as gracile as in more posterior dorsal vertebrae). The CDF is deep, subtriangular in contour and exhibits a pneumatopore that penetrates the vertebra. The prezygapophyses are short and stout, and their articular surfaces are subtriangular in contour. The articular surface of each prezygapophysis is flat to slightly convex and slightly medially facing. The CPRL is located ventral to the prezygapophysis. This lamina is relatively short, straight, anteroposteriorly. The CPRF is subcircular in contour and deep. The parapophyses are notably wide and, as in D6, the articular surface is sigmoidal in contour. An oval and deep pneumatopore is present between the ACDL and the prezygapophyses.

Dorsal 6.

This vertebra is represented by an incomplete neural arch, the right transverse process, the postzygapophyses and the base of the neural spine (Fig. 5B, F–I). The tip of the transverse process and diapophyses are incompletely preserved.

It is identified as a D6 because of the following characters: parapophyses placed between the centrum and neural arch (placed in the centrum in D3 of Murusraptor and D4 of Aerosteon but placed in the neural arch in D7 of Murusraptor and D8 of Aerosteon and Murusraptor). The ACDL is much shorter than the posterior one (subequal in length at the anteriormost dorsals of other Megaraptoridae but absent posterior to 10th dorsal). The transverse process is slightly dorsally oriented (laterally oriented in D3 of Murusraptor and D4 of Aerosteon but more strongly dorsally oriented in D7 of Murusraptor and D8 of Aerosteon and Murusraptor).

In lateral view, the transverse process is subtriangular in contour in cross-section. The articular surface of the process is rounded in contour, slightly concave and ventrolaterally facing. The process shows a rugose anterior surface that probably constitutes the insertion of the ligaments that attach the rib to the vertebra39. Posteriorly, the transverse process shows at least three pneumatic foramina closer to its tip. The PODL is notably stout and sub-vertically oriented. The PO-CDF is deep and shows a pneumatopore just anterior to the postzygapophysis. This fossa occupies the preserved posterior surface of the neural arch. Ventral to this surface and placed between the PCDL there is a strongly rugose surface covered with round pits as well as a pair of foramina. The PO-CDF is deep and pneumatic in nature because presence of two strong pneumatopores below the postzygapophyses. The PCDL is long, robust and slightly posteriorly concave. Close to the tip of the transverse process, this lamina connects with the rugose surface that constitutes the insertion of a ligament. This rugose surface is delimited by a small and round concavity. The ACDL is notably thinner and shorter than other laminae, representing one third of the thickness of the PCDL. The CDF is subtriangular in contour, deep and exhibits two pneumatopores: one subrectangular and placed dorsal to the parapophyses and the other one ovoid in contour and placed between the junctions of both CDL. The PRDL is subvertically oriented, deep and nearly straight. The PR-CDF is deep, subrectangular in contour and pneumatic in nature. The parapophyses are subcircular in contour and relatively large, occupying almost two thirds of the anteroposterior length of the neural arch. The parapophyses are asymmetrical in shape (probably owing to taphonomic deformation); whereas the right one is saddle-shaped, the left one is cup-shaped. Saddle shaped parapophyses constitutes an autapomorphy of this species. The articular surfaces of the postzygapophyses are rounded or squared in contour. The right postzygapophysis shows a pneumatic foramen on its posterior margin. The SPOLs are thick and laterally concave. They are separated by a deep, subtriangular-shaped SPOF. The hyposphene is broken and shows a pneumatic foramen on its right side.

There are well-developed CPRL. It is proximodistally short, ventrolaterally oriented and reaches the lateral margin of the neural arch. Ventral to the prezygapophyses, there is a subcircular and deep CPRF. The PRSF is poorly preserved. The neural canal is subcircular in contour and taller than wide. The hypantrum is very wide and deep. A moderate intervertebral ligament tuberosity is observed on the posterior surface of the neural spine. These tuberosities are thinner ventrally but become progressively transversally wider dorsally.

Dorsal 7.

This element is represented by a partial neural arch exhibiting a complete left transverse process and the left postzygapophyses (Fig. 6).

It is identified as the seventh dorsal because of the presence of: a moderately upturned transverse processes (less dorsally projected than D8 of Aerosteon or D7 and D8 of Murusraptor but similar to D6 described above); a transversely thin hyposphene (thinner than in D4 of Aerosteon but comparable to D8 of Aerosteon and D7 of Murusraptor); and deep, abruptly excavated and moderately narrow SPOF (much deeper and narrower than in D4 of Aerosteon and D6 of Maip and shallower and wider than D8 of Aerosteon and D7 and D8 of Murusraptor).

In anterior view, the PRDL is thick and straight. The transverse process of this element is long and subtriangular in outline when viewed from the side. The expanded distal end of the transverse process is rugose, probably representing muscular or ligament attachments. The articular surface of the diapophysis is ventrolaterally facing and shows a subtriangular rugosity. The PCDL is wide and straight. The PODL is stout. The PO-CDF is deep and close to its dorsal margin it shows small foramina of probable neurovascular nature. Anteromedial to the postzygapophyses, a set of small pneumatic cavities is present. Two pneumatic channels are situated deep within the PO-CDF: one posterior that connects the postzygapophyses to each other, and one anterior which perforates the bone.

The postzygapophysis shows a nearly flat articular surface. The hyposphene is transversely thin and dorsoventrally tall (taller than in D6). The SPOF, dorsally delimits the postzygapophyses. It is notably deep, and subtriangular in contour.

Dorsal 9.

This vertebra is represented by a nearly complete element. The neural spine is strongly distorted and its apex is incomplete. The neural arch lacks the tips of the right transverse process (Fig. 7), and the right postzygapophysis is broken. The centrum is incomplete and distorted on its posterior half.

It is identified as a D9 because of the presence of dorsally upturned and long transverse processes (observed in D10 and D11 of Aerosteon), anteroposteriorly stout transverse process (stouter than D7 of Maip and D8 of Aerosteon but resembling D10 of the same taxa), parapophyses placed entirely on the neural arch (a condition present in the posterior half of the dorsal series), presence of a stout PCDL and weak ACDL (observed in D8 of Aerosteon but not in D10), and centrum taller than wide, as observed in D8 of Aerosteon (but not in more posterior dorsals).

The vertebral centrum in lateral view is subrectangular in contour and slightly taller than long. Its lateral and ventral margins are deeply concave. The pneumatic fossa hosts two pneumatopores. The anterior one is wide and suboval in contour (anteroposteriorly longer than dorsoventrally tall). The posterior pneumatopore is smaller and suboval in outline.

The anterior and posterior articular surfaces of centrum are strongly laterally projected and show striations for the attachment of the intervertebral ligaments. The posterior surface is nearly flat and the anterior one is concave. The ventral surface is smooth and shows numerous neurovascular foramina.

In lateral view, the transverse process is strongly upturned and oriented perpendicular relative to the anteroposterior axis of the vertebra (both features contrast with D6-7 of Maip, which show moderately upturned and slightly posteriorly oriented transverse processes). In cross section, the transverse process is subtriangular. The articular surface of the diapophysis is oval in contour (anteroposteriorly longer than dorsoventrally high), slightly concave and ventrolaterally facing. Anteriorly, the transverse process shows a stout, prominent and dorsally concave SDL. Laterally, this lamina becomes anteroposteriorly lower, rugose and dorsoventrally expanded. Ventrally, this lamina is connected with a short PRDL. This lamina is “L” shaped in lateral view and shows a small projection closer to its anterodorsal margin. Close to its tip, the transverse process shows strong transverse striations along its anterior, dorsal and posterior margins. The diapophyses are surrounded by rugosities. The diapophyses show a strong and rugose ventral projection that shows concave anterior and posterior surfaces. The PODL are straight laterally but, on its medial half, the shaft of these laminae becomes ventrally curved when viewed posteriorly. At mid-length to the transverse process, it is observed an oval and teardrop-shaped surface which encloses at least two oval foramina. Ventrolaterally, this teardrop-shaped surface is delimited by a raised, slender and rugose area. The PCDL is notably stouter than the ACDL. On both sides of the vertebra, the laminae are asymmetrical in shape, at the left side the PCDL shows a subtriangular ventral half that is not present at the right side. The ACDL is reduced and more ventrally placed on the left side of the vertebra. The CDF are also asymmetrical, being notably reduced on the left side but much wider on the right. Indeed, the right side shows three pneumatic openings. The parapophyses are large and rounded in contour, occupying almost half the anteroposterior length of the neural arch. The parapophyses are asymmetrical being saddle-shaped on the right side and cup-shaped on the left one. The anterior margin of the right parapophysis is rugose. It is posterodorsally delimited by a concave, smooth and obliquely oriented surface that probably represents the insertion of the costovertebral ligament40. The articular surfaces of the postzygapophyses are round or subrectangular, ventrally concave and smooth. The hyposphene is transversely thin and dorsoventrally high. The SPOLs are stout and laterally concave. They are separated by a deep, pneumatic and subtriangular SPOF.

The prezygapophyses are stout and strongly anteriorly projected. Its articular surface is subtriangular in contour, nearly flat and dorsally oriented. Medial to the base of the prezygapophyses there is a small, and probably pneumatic, foramen. Ventral to the prezygapophysis is a well-developed CPRL. This lamina is short and stout, ventrolaterally oriented, and reaches the lateral margin of the neural arch. Ventral to the prezygapophyses a subcircular and deep CPRF is present. The hypantrum is wide and deep. The neural canal is ovoid, being dorsoventrally taller than transversely wide. The PRSF is deep, subtriangular in contour and pneumatic. The PRSL is thick and slightly ventrally expanded. The PRSL, together with the SDL and the PRDL, delimit a subtriangular and deep accessory fossa. A notably anteriorly projected intervertebral ligament rugosity is observed on the anterior surface of the neural spine.

Dorsal 10 or 11.

This element consists of an isolated centrum, lacking the posterior articular surface and the posteroventral projection (Fig. 8). This vertebra is interpreted as D10 or D11 based on the presence of a strong projection of the lateral and ventral margins of its anterior and posterior articular surfaces (deeper than D8 of Aerosteon but similar to D10 of Aerosteon and D11 of Murusraptor, Tratayenia and Aerosteon), a deep pneumatopore and a blind fossa immediately posterior to it (present in D10 and D11 of Aerosteon and D11 of Murusraptor).

In lateral view, the vertebral centrum of D10 or 11 is subrectangular and longitudinally concave. The lateral wall is smooth with some obliquely oriented striations, representing the insertion of the intervertebral ligaments, close to the anterior and posterior articular surfaces. In anterior view, the centrum is oval in contour, being slightly taller than wide, and weakly concave. The ventral surface of the centrum is smooth and shows some neurovascular foramina. The anterior articular surface of the centrum is strongly ventrally projected.

In lateral view it shows a deep pneumatic fossa with an anterior pneumatopore and a posterior blind fossa, both separated by an oblique septum. The pneumatopore is very deep, oval in contour and much wider than the blind fossa.

Caudal vertebrae

Caudal vertebrae are represented by two well-preserved neural arches belonging to the most proximal part of the tail. These vertebrae are very similar in morphology as well as its associated laminae and fossae. The transverse process is horizontally and strongly posteriorly oriented. Below this structure are observed three laminae: the PRDL (anteriorly), the ACDL (anteroventrally) and the PCDL (posteroventrally). These laminae delimits other three fossae: the PR-CDF (anteriorly), the CDF (middle) and the PO-CDF (posteriorly). The PO-CDF is divided by a short but deep accessory PCDL, which has not been observed in other megaraptorids and therefore, could be interpreted as an autapomorphy of Maip.

A proximal caudal is represented by its neural arch and neural spine, lacking the tip of the right transverse process. (Fig. 9A–D). It is tentatively assigned as to Ca4 because of the dorsolateral orientation of the transverse process, the great height of the neural spine, and the strong anterior projection of the pre- and postzygapophyses (as is observed in Aoniraptor, Megaraptor, Aerosteon and Murusraptor).

Full size image

The prezygapophyses are short, robust and slightly dorsally upturned. Their articular surfaces are ovoid and face dorsomedially. The PRSF is deep and transversely narrow, and within this fossa there is a subtriangular pneumatopore as occurs in Aoniraptor13. The left process is completely preserved and becomes dorsoventrally thicker towards its tip. It shows strong striations along its dorsal and ventral margins. On its anteroventral corner, the process shows an oval and rugose concavity that probably constitutes the insertion of the m. ilio-ischiocaudalis41,42. The PR-CDF is subtriangular and pneumatic. The CDF is rounded, pneumatic and striated. The PO-CDF is oval and shows a deep pneumatopore. The articular surfaces of the postzygapophyses are ovoid in contour and are ventrolaterally facing. The SPOLs are stout and delimit a wide and pneumatic SPOF. The neural spine is dorsoventrally tall, and becomes notably thick towards its apex. The neural spine is strongly posteriorly inclined and shows well-developed intervertebral ligament rugosities. A shallow groove extends along the anterolateral margin of the neural spine. This groove ends at the base of the neural spine in a shallow fossa. In posterior view, the neural canal is dorsoventrally taller than transversely wide.

A more distal caudal (tentatively recognized as Ca7) is represented by an incomplete neural arch, which lacks the right transverse process, the postzygapophyses and part of the neural spine (Fig. 9E–H). It is referred to the proximal region of the tail because of the presence of wide and strongly posteriorly oriented transverse process and a tall and sub-vertically oriented neural spine.

The prezygapophyses are short, stout, and slightly upturned. The articular surfaces are slightly convex, show a subquadrangular contour, and are medially facing. The SPRL is transversely thin, dorsoventrally tall and subparallel to each other. The SPRF is deep and transversally narrow. The transverse process becomes slightly thicker towards its tip. It shows longitudinally oriented striations close to its tip. On its anteroventral margin, the transverse process shows longitudinal rugosities and striations. Ventral to the transverse process there are short and relatively stout ACDL and PCDL. The CDF is ovoid in contour, deep and pneumatic. Anterior to this lies the PR-CDF, which is smaller than the CDF, subtriangular in contour and also pneumatic. The PRDL is short and sub-horizontally oriented. Posteriorly, the PO-CDF is ovoidal in contour, relatively small and pneumatic. The PCDL delimits a blind and subtriangular-shaped concavity. The neural spine is transversally thin, tall and shows smooth lateral surfaces, with exception of a subtriangular-shaped and raised area at its mid-height and that is covered with striations, probably representing a muscle attachment. On its anterior surface, the neural spine shows subtle intervertebral ligament rugosities. The neural canal is ovoidal in contour, dorsoventrally taller than transversely wide.

Cervical ribs

The cervical rib 5 is represented by its proximal end. It is assigned to CR5 on the basis of the presence of a short and small tubercle, absence of an anterior process, and presence of a large capitulum, a combination of features present in CR5 of Allosaurus, Tyrannosaurus43,44 and CR5 of Aerosteon and CR6 of Megaraptor.

The rib head is small compared with cervical ribs 6 and 8. The lateral surface of the rib head is smooth. The tuberculum is short, and shows slightly convergent margins towards the tip. It shows a convex articular surface that exhibits pneumatic foramina on its lateral margin. In anterior view, the tuberculum and capitulum form a right angle to each other. The capitulum is much anteroposteriorly wider but transversely shorter than the tuberculum. The articular surface of the capitulum is flat or rugose and subquadrangular in contour. The anterior pneumatic fossa is deep, dorsoventrally tall and suboval in outline. The ventral surface of the capitulum is smooth and shows pneumatic foramina close to its articular surface. Medially, a straight and thick transverse lamina connects the tuberculum with the capitulum. The posterior pneumatic fossa is deep and ovoid in contour. The shaft of the rib is rod-like and exhibits a longitudinal and striated concave area immediately posterior to the capitulum.

The cervical rib 7 only lacks its distal tip (Fig. 10A–E). It is assigned to a CR7 on the basis of a well-developed proximal head (absent in anterior ribs); presence of a pointing and well-developed anterior process (present at the mid-length of the neck in Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus), as well as a prominent and strongly projected tubercle; the shaft is notably curved (as in posterior ribs) and the tubercle and capitulum form a nearly right angle when viewed anteriorly (at it occurs in ribs of the mid-length of the neck in Allosaurus).

The rib head is large, subtriangular in lateral view, and anteroposteriorly long. The lateral and ventral surfaces of the rib head are flat, decorated only with some small longitudinal striations. Medially, in cross-section the rib head is deeply concave being “C”-shaped on its anterior half while is straight and “I”-shaped more distally. The anterior process is subtriangular and sharp. Also, such a process exhibits an almost straight ventral margin and a deeply concave anterior margin. The anterior pneumatic fossa is deep, subtriangular in contour and anteriorly facing. The tuberculum is elongate, thick and rod-shaped, with nearly straight anterior and posterior margins. The tuberculum is much longer and thinner than the capitulum. Its articular surface is dorsolaterally facing, rounded in contour, slightly concave and rugose. Close to its articular surface, the tuberculum shows a small and rugose concavity. In anterior view, the tuberculum and the capitulum form an almost right angle. A stout transverse lamina with a concave dorsal margin connects both structures. This lamina is slightly posteriorly oriented. In medial view, this lamina is perforated by an opening that communicates the anterior pneumatic fossa with the posterior one (see below). The capitulum is slightly eroded, it is ovoidal in cross-section and shows a slightly saddle-shaped dorsally faced and rugose articular surface. The capitulum has longitudinal striations close to its articular surface. Posteriorly, the capitulum shows two ovoid pneumatic foramina that are laterally delimited by a curved lamina that connects the capitulum with the rib shaft and, medially, with a thin and concave ridge. The posterior pneumatic fossa is anteroposteriorly long and becomes shallower posteriorly.

Distally, the shaft of the rib is very thin and delicate and becomes abruptly dorsoventrally thinner and slightly ventrally curved. The shaft shows some longitudinal striations close to the tip of the anterior process. In cross-section, the rib is proximally “V”-shaped and becomes ellipsoidal towards its dorsal half.

A left cervical rib probably corresponding to the C8 is almost completely preserved, lacking its distal tip and part of its proximal head (Fig. 10F–H). It is interpreted as CR8 because it has a notably elongate shaft (albeit shorter than the first dorsal rib) that is wider than that of CR7 and that is ventrally curved (a condition observed in ribs of the base of the neck of other theropods43), as well a long and obliquely oriented tuberculum.

The rib head is smaller than in the sixth rib. The tuberculum is slightly anteriorly inclined and strongly offset from the rib head. The anterior margin of the tuberculum is slightly concave and the posterior one is obliquely oriented, straight and dorsally oriented. The articular surface of the tuberculum is convex. The medial surface shows rugosities close to its articular surface. This articular surface shows a posteriorly facing and rugose concavity. Near the base of the tuberculum, part of a pneumatic fossa (probably the posterior one) is preserved. At mid-length, the shaft becomes abruptly thin and rod-like and curves ventrally. This morphology occurs in the posterior half of the neck in other theropods43,44,45. The lateral surface of the rib shaft is flat and dorsoventrally tall anteriorly and becomes progressively shallower posteriorly. The medial margin of the shaft is nearly flat, with a longitudinal rugosity all along its dorsal margin.

Proximally the rib shaft is subrectangular in contour, being transversely compressed, and becomes subcircular in contour at its distal half.

Dorsal ribs

A probable first left dorsal rib is almost completely preserved, lacking only its distal end (Fig. 11A–C). It is identified as a first dorsal rib, because of a strong proximal concavity, a slightly medially concave shaft and the presence of one flange on its posterior side and two flanges on its anterior side (as in Australovenator but also other theropods such as Allosaurus or Tyrannosaurus;43,44).

Figure 11 First (A–D), second (E–G) and sixth (H–J) dorsal ribs of Maip. First dorsal rib in anterior (A, A´), posterior (B, B´) and proximal (C, C´) views and close-up of the proximal end (D). Second dorsal rib in anterior (E, E´), posterior (F, F´) and proximal (G, G´) views. Sixth dorsal rib in anterior (H, H´), posterior (I, I´) and medial (J, J´) views. Scale bars: 5 cm. Abbreviations: ap, anterior process; cap, capitulum; pn, pneumatopore; tub, tuberculum. Full size image

The rib head is robust (much stouter than in the cervical ribs) and anteroposteriorly wide, with a long and dorsally upturned capitulum. The dorsal margin of the rib head is deeply concave; its medial margin is concave and has a dorsoventrally oriented and deep and narrow concavity. The dorsal margin of the rib head projects anteriorly forming an anteromedial flange. Below the tuberculum, the rib head inflates as a strong anteroposterior thickening. This thickening affects the entire rib head and becomes progressively wider through the dorsal part of the head. In anterior view, the rib head shows a dorsoventral oblique groove which is delimited by a subparallel ridge. Within this groove is observed a set of aligned pneumatopores. Such pneumatopores become progressively larger dorsally, forming a honey-comb structure. This condition is observed only in this theropod while other theropods shows apneumatic ribs (such as Allosaurus, carcharodontosaurids, tyrannosaurids, non-avian paravians, among others;43,44,45,46,47,48) or shows only one pneumatic opening (like abelisaurids;49). The posterior surface of the rib head is covered with strong rugosities. Dorsally, the thickening of the rib head is strongly expanded being almost twice the anteroposterior width of the articular surface of the tuberculum. This thickening shows a deep proximal concavity above the head. The tuberculum is dorsally projected, strongly anteroposteriorly thickened and exhibits a rugose articular surface. This surface is oval in contour, concave and dorsally facing. Laterally, the tuberculum shows a rugose bump. At mid-height, the tuberculum shows two foramina within a deep and rugose concavity. The articular surface of the capitulum is rounded in contour. Along its ventral margin, the capitulum shows an anteriorly facing concavity covered by striations and rugosities.

The rib shaft is almost straight and shows an anterior concavity delimited by anteromedial and anterolateral bony flanges. Posteriorly, the rib shaft shows a sharp posterolateral flange that becomes weaker and loses at the mid-height of the rib. The posterolateral flange delimits a posterior concavity.

Proximally, the rib shaft is “L”-shaped in cross section, and becomes ellipsoidal towards its distal end.

A second right dorsal rib is represented by its proximal end (Fig. 11D–F). It is identified as a second rib because of the presence of a mediolaterally long capitulum (longer that in DR1 of Murusraptor and Australovenator but shorter than in DR2 or 3 of Australovenator), a shallow proximal concavity (deeper than DR1 but similar to DR2 or 3 of Australovenator), and the presence of one posterior and two anterior longitudinal flanges on the rib shaft.

The rib head is a thin plate, concave at its central part but strongly concave ventrally and laterally. Dorsally, the head is straight with aligned capitulum and tuberculum. Below the capitulum and in the ventral margin of the rib head, are observed a shallow concavity and a deep slender concavity. Posteriorly the rib head is covered by ventromedially–dorsolaterally oriented striations. Ventral to the tuberculum, on the anterior surface of the rib head is observed an oval rugose surface. The tuberculum is dorsally projected, squared in contour and separated from the capitulum by a deep concavity. The tuberculum shows a round but flat articular surface. Below the tuberculum it is observed a big and subtriangular pneumatopore. From the medial side of the tuberculum, rises a strong, dorsally projected and rugose ridge, which projects ventromedially reaching the posterior surface of the rib head. Furthermore, the lateral side of the tuberculum shows a rugose and laterally projected bump. Both structures (ridge and bump), represents the insertions of the costovertebral ligaments40. On its posterior surface, the tuberculum shows a raised surface delimited by a round lip and enclosing numerous small foramina (probably of pneumatic origin). The capitulum is dorsomedially facing and shows an expanded and rugose articular surface for the parapophysis. The articular surface of the capitulum is oval in contour (mediolaterally wider than anteroposteriorly long) and saddle-shaped (laterally concave and medially convex). Immediately lateral to the capitulum is observed a short ridge surrounded by striations. Also, a set of rugosities is observed surrounding the articular surface of the capitulum as a ring. Anteriorly, the capitulum shows two sets of striations: one of weak and oblique striations placed laterally to the capitulum and one of almost horizontal and strong striations placed below the capitulum. Both sets of lineations are considered as the insertion of the costovertebral ligament. In anterior view, from the shaft of the rib rises the anterolateral flange, which is deep and runs along the lateral margin of the shaft. On the medial side of the shaft, it is observed the anteromedial flange; which is sharp but weaker than the anterolateral one. Both flanges delimit an anterior concavity and, contrarily to the posterior side, do not intersect each other. Adjacent to the tuberculum and in the posterior face of the rib, it is observed the posterolateral flange which runs along the lateral margin of the bone and following its shaft. This flange is very deep and delimits a posterior concave surface. The preserved part of the rib is “8”-shaped in cross-section.

A fragmentary rib is identified as a possible left sixth dorsal rib, mainly because of its big size (Fig. 11G–J). It is only represented by an incomplete proximal part of shaft. It is notably stout, much more than other ribs. Its proximalmost preserved part shows a “T” shaped cross-section, with concave anterior and posterior margins. The anterior surface is deeper than the posterior one. Ventrally, the shaft becomes strongly thickened forming a hyperostosed “belly”. This belly is posteromedially projected and is thicker at mid-height. Posteriorly, it shows a deep and ovoidal pneumatopore that communicates with a big internal pneumatic chamber and with the posterior concave surface. The surface of the belly is covered with striations and rugosities. A low but stout posterolateral flange runs along the entire length of the rib.

Gastralia

The total number of gastral ribs in Maip is unknown. The length of the largest and most completely preserved medial gastral rib is about 45 cm, with a reconstructed length of roughly 60 cm. The widest point of the thorax of Maip (at the level of D6) would have had 140 cm in transverse width.

Medial elements

These elements are dorsally curved with a thin shaft and a paddle-shaped medial end (Fig. 12A–D). The anterior medial elements show stouter and less anteroposteriorly curved shafts. The shaft becomes thinner towards its lateral end. In cross-section, the shaft is subcircular or ovoidal at mid-length and becomes sub-quadrangular towards the lateral end. Towards the medial end, the shaft becomes dorsoventrally thinner because of the presence of a medial paddle which constitutes the surface for articulation with the opposite medial gastral element. Anteriorly, the shaft shows the articular surface for the lateral gastral element, which is represented by a concave or flat surface that may reach a fifth of the entire total length of the element. The paddle-shaped medial end shows an anterior flange that is anterodorsally projected and a posterior one that is posteroventrally oriented. Consequently, the medial end of the element is posterodorsally facing. This posterodorsal surface articulates with the anteroventral surface of the posterior gastralia, resulting in the typical theropod interwoven gastral arrangement43,44.

Lateral elements

These elements are rod-like and gently curved (Fig. 12E,F). The longest preserved element reaches 30 cm. The shaft is oval in cross-section and exhibits its widest point close to the lateral end. Its medial end is relatively thin and shows a concave articular surface with the medial gastral element that is exposed in posterior view. This surface does not reach half of the total length of the element. The lateral end of the element is relatively stout and ends in a rounded surface.

Pectoral girdle

Coracoid

The left coracoid is almost completely preserved, only lacking its dorsal margin and most of the biceps tubercle (Fig. 13). This bone is very thin with the exception of its posterior half, which shows a strong buttress that was continuous with the scapula. In lateral view the coracoid is ovoidal in contour, being more than twice as tall dorsoventrally as it is long anteroposteriorly. The lateral surface is smooth and concave. Medially, the coracoid is deeply concave, this concavity being deepest at its center. The scapular articulation is rugose.

The anterior margin of the coracoid is convex and shows a prominent anterior projection, which is absent in other megaraptorans (such as Fukuiraptor, Megaraptor or Aerosteon). Dorsal to this projection, the anterior margin shows rugosities for muscular attachment, and ventrally it shows a posteromedially facing articular surface. This surface appears to be absent in other megaraptorans such as Fukuiraptor, Aerosteon and Megaraptor. Based on its position it is possible to infer that it constituted the articular surface for the sternum. No signs of the sternum has been recovered in Maip and other megaraptorans, and it is probable that it was mostly cartilaginous or poorly ossified.

Only the base of the bicep tubercle was preserved, but it seems to be robust and not reduced as in Aerosteon34. The coracoid foramen is moderate, ovoidal and subvertically oriented. Posteriorly to the foramen, there are strong anteroposteriorly oriented striations that represent the anchoring of the m. biceps brevis50. In medial view, the coracoid foramen is ovoidal, posteriorly oriented and close to the limit with the articulation with the scapula. It does not form a groove connecting with the scapula as is observed in Aerosteon14. The glenoid cavity is straight and does not project laterally to form a lip. The posteroventral process is prominent, subtriangular in contour when viewed from the side, and ventrally projected. It shows on its medial side, strong and curved rugosities that are subparallel to the margins of such a process. Such structures may correspond with the attachment of the m coracobrachialis50. Maip shows a relatively simple posteroventral process that lacks the vertical lamina, subglenoid ridge and deep subglenoid fossa present in Aerosteon14. A subglenoid fossa is very shallow and poorly defined in Maip.","['Aranciaga Rolando', 'Alexis M.', 'Laboratorio De Anatomía Comparada Y Evolución De Los Vertebrados', 'Museo Argentino De Ciencias Naturales', 'Bernardino Rivadavia', 'Conicet', 'Ciudad Autónoma De Buenos Aires', 'Motta', 'Matias J.', 'Agnolín']",
