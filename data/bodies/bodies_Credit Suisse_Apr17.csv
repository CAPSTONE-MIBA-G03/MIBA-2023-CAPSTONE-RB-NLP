Outflows from Credit Suisse branded investment funds have accelerated in the weeks since its historic merger with Swiss rival UBS, as investors continue to redeem billions of dollars.

Data provided to Financial News by Morningstar shows net outflows from around 300 EU and US domiciled Credit Suisse funds have reached $5.6 billion over the three weeks since the tie-up.

The latest outflows will pile pressure on the merged firm; investors had already pulled around $3 billion from Credit Suisse funds in the week surrounding the shotgun wedding.

The latest figures show an additional $2.5 billion of net outflows from Credit Suisse funds between March 23 and April 6.

“It is fair to say that there is still uncertainty around the deal and the potential impact that it may have on Credit Suisse Asset Management,” Johann Scholtz, an equity analyst at Morningstar told FN.

Heavy outflows from Credit Suisse funds began on March 14, the day the bank said it had discovered “material weaknesses” in its financial reporting controls.

Credit Suisse declined to comment.

The largest daily outflows remain those recorded on March 21 — two days after the landmark deal was announced — when $776 million was pulled from Credit Suisse’s European funds.

Despite the steady outflows in recent weeks, the Morningstar figures show Credit Suisse’s European funds posted net inflows of more than $240 million over April 5 and April 6 — an early indication that investor jitters are starting to subside.

The flows data does not include all the asset manager’s funds in Europe and the U,S,, and represents only those funds that report daily figures to Morningstar.

Laith Khalaf, head of investments at online platform AJ Bell, said the bulk of fund outflows in the days surrounding the tie-up with UBS was likely driven by investors worried about the stability of Credit Suisse and those spooked by wider banking sector turmoil.

“Those assets should be ring-fenced in the event of an insolvency, but investors might have decided that a belt-and-braces approach was required given the febrile market conditions at the time,” he said.

The $3.25 billion tie-up between UBS and Credit Suisse — the biggest merger between two systematically integral banks since the 2008 global financial crisis — also combined the banks’ respective asset management units, creating Europe’s largest money manager with $1.5 trillion.

UBS announced on March 29 that former boss Sergio Ermotti would return to oversee the merger. Ermotti, who stepped down as UBS chief in 2020 after nine years in the role, took over from Ralph Hamers at the start of April.

Analysts told FN last month that Ermotti would likely face significant challenges bringing together the two management arms, citing differences in corporate cultures, overlapping product ranges and technology issues.

Scholtz said some outflows in recent weeks may have been driven by Credit Suisse’s wealth management clients moving to other firms to “lower their concentration risk” if they are already using similar wealth products and services offered by UBS.

Similarly, some institutional investors with allocation to Credit Suisse funds may want to diversify if they are also UBS Asset Management clients, he said.

But there are several silver linings for investors right now, according to Credit Suisse.

Here are 15 stocks that are about to post strong earnings this quarter.

Negative earnings momentum will carry into the coming quarter, according to Credit Suisse.

In Q4 2022, earnings declined for the first time since 2020. Current consensus estimates for Q1 indicate that corporate profits for S&P 500 companies will decline yet again, this time by 6.4% year-over-year, wrote Jonathan Golub, the chief US equity strategist at Credit Suisse, in an April 12 note.

Earnings are expected to keep falling in Q1. Credit Suisse

Markets are bracing for weaker profits in seven of the 11 S&P 500 sectors, Golub wrote. While it's worth mentioning that earnings estimates often slip in the three months before the Q1 earnings season, Golub noted that the drop is typically by a more modest 4.2%.

Q1 earnings revisions are more negative than usual, according to Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse

Lower earnings shouldn't come as a surprise to investors. In late December, Golub predicted that earnings would slide by 3% to 4% year-over-year in 2023.

Silver linings in a shaky earnings environment

Although earnings appear set to tumble this quarter, a closer look suggests that investors shouldn't be completely fearful about stocks right now.

While earnings are projected to fall by 6.4% in Q1, Golub noted that the median S&P 500 company is actually expected to enjoy positive earnings growth of 0.6%. That implies that poor results from a handful of large stocks in the index will drag down the average.

Weaker bottom-lines are also masking anticipated strength in sales growth, Credit Suisse found. Revenue for S&P 500 firms is forecast to rise 1.7% in Q1, Golub wrote, adding that technology is the only sector where top-line growth is supposed to be lower than it was in the first quarter of 2022. The issue for stocks is profit margins, which are expected to fall 9.9% across sectors.

But it's still possible that earnings will beat dismal expectations. Of the 21 companies that shared their Q1 quarterly results early, 20 of them beat estimates by an average of 10.9%, Golub noted. That surprising strength mirrors resilience in the economy and the labor market.

While earnings will likely get off to a rocky start in Q1, they are set to rise consistently throughout the year and eke out a gain by the end of 2023, according to consensus estimates cited by Golub.

""Profits are likely to bottom in 2Q, assuming a similar pace of revisions experienced in recent quarters, and turn positive in 4Q23, helped by easy comps,"" Golub wrote in the note.

15 stocks that will carry the market's earnings

In his note, Golub listed 15 companies that will be the biggest positive influences on S&P 500 earnings growth in Q1, even though the overall estimate is negative.

Stocks that made the list have a variety of catalysts, including easy year-over-year comparisons, robust refining margins for energy companies, and a continued economic reopening for cruise lines, casinos, and airlines.

Those 15 stocks are below, along with the ticker, weight of S&P 500 profits, expected earnings growth, and expected contribution to earnings growth for each.",['James Faris'],2023-04-17 00:00:00

Sources say senior officials are reportedly reaching out to around 1,500 clients who lost a total 95 billion yen ($717 million) when Swiss regulators wrote down the value of Credit Suisse’s contingent convertible bonds –– also known as CoCo bonds or Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds –– last month.

American depositary receipts of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group were up almost 1% in Monday premarket trading.

The bonds were purchased through MUFG’s brokerage venture with Morgan Stanley Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.

Of those 1,500 client accounts, 1,300 were held by individual investors and the rest were owned by corporations, according to a spokeswoman from Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities on Monday.

A spokesperson for the bank told Bloomberg that it is looking into whether wealth managers operating within the venture properly explained the risks of AT1 bonds.

Those bonds were designed to be risky and could be written down if a bank needs capital in an emergency. But when the Switzerland’s government wiped out the debt at Credit Suisse as part of a planned deal for the Swiss bank to be taken over by UBS some bondholders lashed out against the move and sought legal advice.

The move rocked the bond market and put the health of some European banks into the spotlight, with similar bonds at Deutsche Bank dropping in value after the event.

“We are very sorry that we are causing our clients concern,” Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley told Bloomberg. “We will continue to offer thorough explanations to the customers who have been affected.”

https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/credit-suisse-class-action-could-force-banks-clean-their-act-says-finance-expert-1715144,"Credit Suisse class action could force banks to clean up their act, says finance expert","The recent class actions filed against investment bank Credit Suisse send a strong message that companies with international importance must clean up their act, says a finance expert.

Tom Davey, Co-Founder and Director of Factor Risk Management, a global litigation finance company, believes the current lack of effective regulation leaves bondholders and shareholders ""carrying the can"".

Earlier this year, Credit Suisse and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) became embroiled in a debate over the severity of reporting deficiencies that led the Swiss bank to delay its annual report.

Credit Suisse said in March it had postponed the annual filing after a ""late call"" with the regulator which raised questions about earlier financial statements.

However, correspondence published in the SEC's online database on Tuesday shows that agency staff first raised questions with Credit Suisse officials in July 2022.

The last-minute delay concerned analysts and sent Credit Suisse shares to near an all-time low.

Figures from Morningstar Direct show that more than $450m (£369m) was withdrawn from Credit Suisse's US and European-managed funds between 13 and 15 March, as retail and institutional investors pulled their money from the embattled lender.

Credit Suisse's chairman apologised to shareholders for bringing the 167-year-old lender to the brink of bankruptcy.

""I am truly sorry,"" Axel Lehmann said, addressing the final meeting of shareholders last week. ""I apologise that we were no longer able to stem the loss of trust.""

The collapse of the banking firm led the Swiss government to use an emergency law to push through a state-backed mega-merger of the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) and Credit Suisse, controversially sidelining the country's parliament in the process.

Switzerland's two parliamentary chambers voted to reject the government's 109 billion Swiss francs ($122.82 billion) in aid for the deal between the country's two biggest banks.

A recent Sotomo poll showed two-thirds of the population was against the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse, while a third of respondents were angry that emergency laws had been used to bypass parliament.

The collapse and subsequent merger of Credit Suisse with UBS has left them facing at least 6-class action lawsuits.

US investors claim that it overstated its prospects before last month's shares crash, while bondholders are also preparing a lawsuit over the write-down of the company's bonds, as they now face only receiving a fraction of their value before the UBS takeover.

According to Davey, the increased use of private criminal prosecutions as well as civil action against banks could force them to improve their entity management.

He said: ""The greatest regulator of behaviour is the credible threat of paying compensation.""

With the threat of legal action looming over the Swiss firm, shareholders lashed out at the board of directors and former management, including advisory firm Ethos, who in turn denounced the ""greed and incompetence of the bank's managers.""

""Shareholders have lost considerable amounts of money and thousands of jobs are on the line,"" the firm stated.

UBS reportedly plans to cut its current workforce by up to 30 per cent, which translates to approximately 36,000 positions worldwide, after completing its takeover of the troubled Swiss lender.

The two companies jointly employed over 120,000 people at the end of 2022, including 30 per cent of the total workforce in Switzerland.

While UBS said it will soon provide better clarity on the layoffs, the latest cutback surpasses the 9,000 layoffs announced by Credit Suisse last month.

Following the Swiss Firm's dramatic collapse, Silicon Valley Bank also teetered on bankruptcy after revealing it had a hole in its finances.

The demise of both banks is the biggest bank failure in the US since the financial crisis of 2008, leading to heightened demands for banks to face tougher regulations on their management of legal entity governance and compliance.

With this in mind, American President Joe Biden called on Congress to allow regulators to impose tougher penalties on the executives of failed banks, including clawing back pay and bonuses and making it easier to bar them from working in the industry again.

Biden said: ""No one is above the law - and strengthening accountability is an important deterrent to prevent mismanagement in the future.""

After the 2008 Financial Crisis and significant conduct failures such as the manipulation of the London Interbank Offered Rate, the UK government began to initiate reforms on entity management regulations, however, other countries have been slower to the punch.

What was once considered ""housekeeping"" must now be the focus of a cultural shift within organisations, according to Daniel Connell, Deloitte Global Leader for Legal Entity Management, to satisfy revenue authorities and meet expectations of transparency on a global scale.

In March 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued proposed rules that would require public companies to include extensive climate-related information in their registration statements and periodic reports.

Disclosure concerning climate-related risks and impacts, oversight and governance of climate-related risks, climate-related financial statement metrics, climate-related goals, and greenhouse gas emissions would become a legal requirement.

A report released on Wednesday revealed that the World's Biggest Banks Continued to Pour Billions into Fossil Fuel Expansion.

The 14th annual Banking on Climate Chaos report, endorsed by 624 organizations from 75 countries, showed that U.S. banks dominate fossil fuel financing, accounting for 28 per cent of all fossil fuel financing in 2022.

JPMorgan Chase remains the world's worst funder of climate chaos since the Paris Agreement. Citi, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America are still among the top 5 fossil financiers since 2016.

Lucie Pinson, executive director and founder of Reclaim Finance, said it is ""business as usual"" for most banks and investors who continue to support fossil fuel developers without any restrictions, despite their high-profile commitments to carbon neutrality.

Despite the recent turmoil in the banking industry, JPMorgan Chase reported a jump in first-quarter profits Friday alongside fellow banking giants Citigroup and Wells Fargo, reassuring investors and easing contagion fears.",['Callum Conway-Shaw'],2023-04-17 12:30:16+01:00

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's Board of Governors on Friday said it has approved UBS Group AG's acquisition of the U.S. subsidiaries of Credit Suisse, clearing another major hurdle for the completion of the Swiss-brokered rescue deal.

UBS has committed to give the U.S. central bank an implementation plan for combining its U.S. business and operations with those of Credit Suisse within three months of consummating the deal, the Fed's Board said in a statement. The plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution, the statement said.

The U.S. central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

UBS had requested the Fed's approval of the merger March 22, the Fed said.

After years of scandal and losses, 167-year-old Credit Suisse came to the brink of collapse before Zurich-based rival UBS rode to the rescue with a merger engineered and bankrolled by the Swiss authorities last month. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

The Swiss authorities and UBS Group AG have been racing to close the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG within as little as a month, in an effort to retain the lender's clients and employees, Reuters previously reported.

UBS secured a temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, people familiar with the process told Reuters.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

The Fed subjects firms with more than $700 billion in assets, or more than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activities, to heightened supervision, including annual company-run stress tests and increased liquidity standards.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mufg-clients-lost-700-million-090125498.html,MUFG Clients Lost $700 Million in Credit Suisse AT1 Wipeout,"(Bloomberg) -- Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.’s wealthy clients lost more than $700 million on Credit Suisse Group AG’s riskiest bonds purchased through the Japanese bank’s brokerage venture with Morgan Stanley, according to people familiar with the matter.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Japan’s largest banking group is holding meetings of senior officials to look into the matter as it reaches out to roughly 1,500 clients who lost a combined 95 billion yen ($717 million), said the people, who asked not to be named discussing private information.

While MUFG is hardly the only firm to get caught up in the Credit Suisse debacle, the loss tally offers one of the first glimpses into how badly clients of a major investment bank were burned by the writedown. The Credit Suisse bonds, known as Additional Tier 1 notes, were purchased by customers from Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co.

A spokesperson for the bank confirmed the losses.

Other Lenders

A representative for Mizuho Financial Group Inc.’s brokerage unit said its clients have lost more than 4 billion yen on Credit Suisse AT1s. Daiwa Securities Group Inc.’s client lost less than 1 billion yen on the instruments, according to a spokesperson.

A representative for Nomura Holdings Inc. said it hadn’t sold any of the Swiss lender’s AT1s in Japan. A spokesperson for SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. declined to comment.

MUFG is also checking that wealth managers at the brokerage - one of the two joint ventures between the Japanese institution and the Wall Street giant - appropriately explained to the buyers the risks associated with the debt, the spokesperson said.

The development illustrates how the fallout from Credit Suisse’s rescue by rival UBS Group AG and the resulting wipeout of about 16 billion Swiss francs ($18 billion) of its AT1 bonds is being felt across global finance. The deal to save the bank rendered the notes worthless, allowing Credit Suisse shareholders to recoup some value.

Story continues

The AT1 notes were risky and designed to be written down in the event of Credit Suisse needing capital in a hurry. Some holders argue that they were treated unfairly and are looking for legal remedies.

Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley has been working to boost profit through wealth management services in Japan, where banks have been increasingly competing to manage a larger slice of the nation’s roughly 2 quadrillion yen in household financial assets.

“We are very sorry that we are causing our clients concern,” Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley said by email. “We will continue to offer thorough explanations to the customers who have been affected.”

ZURICH/BERN, April 14 (Reuters) - Switzerland's tradition of dependable consensus politics has taken a battering after the government used an emergency law to push through a state-backed mega-merger of UBS (UBSG.S) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), sidelining the country's parliament.

Switzerland's two parliamentary chambers voted to reject the government's 109 billion Swiss francs ($122.82 billion) in aid for the deal between the country's two biggest banks, delivering a slap in the face for government.

The defeat is symbolic as it cannot change the merger, but it is a blow for the government in an election year and makes it harder to build broad support among the population for the biggest corporate rescue in Swiss history.

The use of emergency laws, in which shareholders and parliamentarians have no say, will also damage the standing of Switzerland's financial industry abroad, analysts have said, especially as it faces rising competition from other financial centres like Singapore.

The Swiss political model is under pressure at the moment, said political scientist Michael Hermann, a director of pollsters Sotomo, adding that the foreign perception of Switzerland as business friendly and as a financial safe haven could be undermined.

""Legitimacy in Swiss politics has been weakened, People who worried about an over powerful government during COVID will see their fears confirmed,"" said Hermann.

""This is damaging for the trust in democracy – parliament says no, but the emergency credits still go through.""

A recent Sotomo poll showed two thirds of the population was against the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse, while a third of respondents were angry that emergency laws had been used to bypass parliament.

The affair has already boosted support for populist right wing groups like the anti-immigrant Swiss People's Party (SVP) and the libertarian Aufrecht Schweiz movement in local elections since the takeover. Both parties are looking to make gains in national elections in October.

PARLIAMENT 'CIRCUMVENTED'

The Credit Suisse/UBS merger marked the first time that parliament had withheld its support for emergency laws designed to deal quickly with crises.

The facility to act without parliamentary approval, introduced in 2000, was used during the COVID pandemic to enforce restrictions and again last year to provide a Swiss energy producer with a credit line.

In the lead-up to the UBS/Credit Suisse merger last month, Swiss emergency law allowed a sub-group of six members of parliament to approve a cabinet plan to give financial aid on behalf of the legislative body, angering the almost 250 lawmakers, who were left without a say.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter defended the use of the emergency powers, saying Switzerland was not an ""emergency dictatorship.""

""We don't do it for fun. We really didn't know what else to do,"" Keller-Sutter told parliament during a stormy emergency session this week. ""The emergency law is based on the federal constitution and I don't think it's correct to say it's illegal.""

Lawmakers were dismayed.

""It has not been a great moment for Swiss democracy. It is terrible parliament has been put in this position and basically circumvented,"" said Roger Nordmann, leader of the Social Democrat group in the Swiss lower house told Reuters.

The Swiss government said it would take into account the rejection by parliament, but stressed the success of the takeover of Switzerland's second biggest bank - intended to prevent a financial meltdown - was paramount.

Industry experts said the deal was unlikely to be changed by politicians, with UBS being given a free hand to determine how many jobs will go and what will be done with Credit Suisse's valuable domestic retail banking business.

Swiss media has reported that the takeover could result in the combined bank cutting its Swiss workforce by up to 30%, which could cost 11,000 jobs.

""Despite the anger, most policy-makers do not want to interfere in the merger, to create and bear the risk that the merger does not succeed,"" said Hans Gersbach, co-director of the KOF economic research institute at ETH Zurich.

""Politicians might have wanted to show their disapproval about what happened, but they don’t want the UBS takeover to fail.""

Ultimately, 209 billion Swiss francs are being provided as state and central bank guarantees and support in the plan drawn up by the seven-strong Swiss cabinet, which has members from four political parties.

The amount is equivalent to around a quarter of Switzerland's entire economic output, and includes emergency liquidity injections and a state pledge to absorb up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS, based on documents outlining the deal.

Peter Kunz, an expert in economic law at the University of Bern, said the lawmakers were ultimately powerless to change it.

""In Switzerland, we often pat ourselves on the back for having the oldest democracy in the world. Yet seven people decided on 250 billion francs of support, an unimaginably huge sum of money,"" he said.

""And the parliament has no say in the matter. The use of such emergency legislation, overturning antitrust rules, is a problem for Swiss democracy and rule of law. It calls Swiss democracy into question.""

By Noele Illien and John Revill

BERN (Reuters) -Switzerland's parliament on Tuesday failed to approve the 109 billion Swiss francs ($120.5 billion) of financial guarantees used to rescue Credit Suisse last month, in a first-round vote that was largely symbolic given the state had committed the funds.

The lower house retrospectively rejected the rescue near midnight, with heated debates continuing into the early hours of Wednesday morning as members discussed other measures related to Credit Suisse.

Earlier on Tuesday, Switzerland's upper house had approved the rescue, meaning the two chambers of the legislative body will vote again on Wednesday.

Lawmakers were recalled for a rare extraordinary session to discuss the rapid rescue of Credit Suisse and the Swiss government's open chequebook response to a collapse that many in the country have blamed on top management.

A shotgun marriage which saw Credit Suisse taken over by Zurich-based rival UBS for 3 billion Swiss francs and propped up with more than 250 billion Swiss francs in guarantees and support has been the subject of widespread criticism.

While earlier in the day, 29 of Switzerland's 46-member Council of States upper house approved the measure, it was later rejected with 102 of the 200-Member National Council voting against it.

The votes are, however, largely symbolic because the state committed the funds and lawmakers cannot overturn that decision.

In the lead-up to the merger last month, Swiss emergency law was used so that a sub-group of six members of parliament approved the financial commitment on behalf of the legislative body, to the ire of the almost 250 lawmakers left without a say.

""The use of emergency law has reached a level in the last three years that is beginning to annoy me,"" Hansjoerg Knecht, a member of Parliament's upper house, said.

Calling the situation where the legislative body can only approve the already committed credits ""unsatisfactory"", Knecht said if Credit Suisse was to require more cash, there should be no use of emergency law to bypass parliament.

'LOTS OF QUESTIONS'

Switzerland's finance minister had addressed the Council of States before the vote and acknowledged the ire being voiced.

""I heard anger, I heard frustration, sometimes I also heard a bit of helplessness,"" Karin Keller-Sutter said, adding that the merger between historic cross-town rivals Credit Suisse and UBS was not a forced marriage, but one of convenience.

She also there needed to be a discussion around the kind of financial centre Switzerland wanted to be and whether it wanted to continue playing in the top league globally.

""What kind of consequences does this have for the financial regulator? For politics? These discussions need to be had. What do we really want and if we want that, we won't get there without carrying certain risk in future as well,"" she said.

A poll of Swiss economists found that nearly half thought the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS was not the best solution, warning the saga had dented Switzerland's reputation.

Celine Widmer, a Swiss National Council member for the left-leaning Social Democrats told Reuters ahead of the vote that ""lots of questions"" needed to be answered.

Politicians also questioned why the Swiss financial regulator was unable to prevent Credit Suisse's failure.

""Does FINMA need stronger instruments or have they done a bad job?"" Eva Herzog asked during a speech to the upper house.

Herzog is one of the six members of parliament who approved the rescue deal on behalf of the legislative body.

As part of the unusual event, the third such session in more than 20 years, the Swiss parliament had a chance to challenge the rushed rescue package and to discuss whether conditions could be imposed on Credit Suisse.

Last week, Switzerland announced it was cutting bonus payments for Credit Suisse's top management.

Credit Suisse's rescue angered not only politicians but many in Switzerland. A survey by political research firm gfs.bern found a majority of Swiss did not support the deal.

There are also growing worries about jobs and in an open letter to parliament, the Swiss Bank Employees' Association said that Credit Suisse and UBS must freeze any cuts.

ZURICH, April 11 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and UBS (UBSG.S) must freeze any job cuts planned as part of their emergency merger, the Swiss Bank Employees' Association (SBPV) said on Tuesday, in an open letter to the country's parliament.

SBPV managing director Natalia Ferrara has written to lawmakers to demand they consider staff affected by the collapse of Credit Suisse and halt any job losses until the end of 2023.

""We ... call on you to support our demand for a freeze on layoffs by the end of 2023 in parliament,"" Ferrara wrote in the letter seen by Reuters.

""Politicians must not shirk their responsibility,"" she added.

The Swiss parliament is due to meet in extraordinary session on Tuesday to discuss the state-sponsored rescue of Credit Suisse which took place last month.

UBS agreed to buy Zurich rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.31 billion) in a deal engineered by the government, the central bank and market regulator to avoid a meltdown in the country's financial system.

""For the past three weeks, many of the approximately 17,000 employees at Credit Suisse and the 22,000 UBS employees have been looking at their future with uncertainty,"" said Ferrara, referring to the staff numbers in Switzerland.

Credit Suisse employs 45,000 people globally, while UBS has 74,000 in total.

""In the public debate about the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, there is a lot of talk about numbers, money, regulation, 'too big to fail' or bonuses,"" wrote Ferrara, whose organisation represents 6,000 workers in Switzerland.

""But the affected employees of the two banks remain only a side note. That needs to change.""

UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti last week warned there would be ""change and hard decisions"" ahead following the takeover.

The giant bank created could reduce its workforce by 20%-30%, it has been reported by Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger, with 11,000 jobs being cut in Switzerland.

UBS has said it is too early to speculate on job cuts.

Ferrara said it was not the fault of the bank employees that the rescue was required, adding it would take months for UBS's plans to be worked out.

""Now it is time for the affected employees of the two banks to be given protection and respect,"" Ferrara wrote in the letter that was first published by Swiss newspaper Blick on Tuesday.

""It must not be the case that parliament debates money and technical aspects of the CS rescue for days during the extraordinary session and the people affected are forgotten.""

GENEVA -- Switzerland's lower house of parliament issued a searing — though symbolic — rebuke Wednesday of an emergency plan spearheaded by the executive branch to prop up embattled Credit Suisse and shepherd it into a takeover by Swiss banking rival UBS.

The National Council, through an unusual left-right alliance, voted twice over the last day to reject government guarantees authorized last month of 100 billion Swiss francs (about $110 billion) to help keep Credit Suisse afloat and 9 billion francs to help UBS mop up any losses it may incur in the deal.

The votes took place in a special parliamentary session that wrapped up Wednesday to scrutinize long-running troubles at Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old bank that was a pillar of Swiss finance, and the government plan to save it from a collapse that could have shaken the global financial system.

Switzerland's main right-wing party opposed tighter regulations on banks, while centrists favored tougher rules but would accept state help for banks in some cases. Left-leaning parties that have long decried “overly dangerous” banks were insistent on stricter limits on bonuses for top executives and requirements for more money to be kept on hand by the biggest lenders.

""The whole discussion centered on whether more regulation was needed — in particular to the leverage ratio — and severely regulate bonuses of the managers of the big, systemically important banks,"" Socialist lawmaker Roger Nordmann said.

Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter, who has been at the epicenter of a political firestorm around the 3 billion franc ($3.25 billion) Credit Suisse-UBS deal, told lawmakers that capital requirements would be increased — and “you can start from the premise that big banks will face more severe restrictions.”

But Nordmann, who had questioned the minister on that issue, said by phone that Keller-Sutter hadn't presented any clear measures and was too noncommittal.

“That's an invitation for all dishonest bankers to come to Switzerland, and what we need is honest people,” he said.

The votes were symbolic because a parliamentary commission has already signed on to the emergency rescue plan that Swiss authorities orchestrated last month as shares of Credit Suisse sank and customers rushed to pull out their money. The failure of two U.S. banks just days before had sparked concerns about the stability of the Swiss lender and the global financial system.

Both the Swiss central bank and the government splashed out more than 200 billion Swiss francs in guarantees to help underpin the fusion of the country's top two banks and keep Credit Suisse from failing.

Parliament's upper house had voted Tuesday to accept the takeover plan announced March 19 by Switzerland’s seven-member executive branch — known as the Federal Council, which is headed by the Swiss president — as well as the Swiss National Bank and the financial markets regulator, FINMA.

Lawmakers in the upper house backed a plan that would have included limits to bonuses for bankers, but it didn't go far enough for the lower house.

For now, stricter legislative rules on Switzerland's biggest banks — led by UBS — are in limbo ahead of crucial elections for parliament this fall.",['Abc News'],
https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/swiss-lawmakers-pick-apart-credit-suisse-woes-ahead-98493450,Swiss lawmakers pick apart Credit Suisse woes ahead of deal,"GENEVA -- Switzerland’s parliament opened a special session Tuesday to scrutinize the state-imposed takeover of Swiss bank Credit Suisse by rival UBS — and consider strengthening the legal arsenal to better gird against financial blowups.

The debate could run up to three days, with lawmakers voicing — and needing to iron out — disagreements over the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.25 billion) fusion of Switzerland's top two banks, a thunderclap for a country that prides itself on finesse and acumen in finance.

Swiss authorities stepped in as shares of Credit Suisse plunged last month and depositors pulled their money after the failure of two U.S. banks sparked concerns about the stability of global financial system and the long-troubled lender. Credit Suisse is among 30 “globally systemically important banks,” and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

“The situation on the financial markets has calmed down, but it is not fully stabilized, and our country — Switzerland — has emerged shaken by this painful episode,” Swiss President Alain Berset said at the session.

He said lawmakers would need to ensure that the legal framework was “as solid as possible to prevent this kind of crisis from happening again.” The executive branch also would look into “too big to fail” rules for key banks passed after the 2008 global financial crisis that may need changing, Berset added.

Lawmakers also are considering accountability for Credit Suisse and concerns about thousands of expected job cuts and looking at state-backed guarantees of over $100 billion aimed at holding the bank together until the merger is completed and buttressing UBS against possible losses.

They also are debating what it will mean for Switzerland to have one giant bank.

Johanna Gapany, a centrist lawmaker and rapporteur for the upper chamber's finance commission, said the parliamentary panel had made three main proposals: change competition rules in light of the emergence of megabank UBS, examine how Credit Suisse executives might be held accountable and block the executive branch from unilaterally releasing more emergency funds for the rescue plan.

The proposals showed a ""clear intention to not only prevent this situation from happening again, but to make sure that the solution protects the interests of citizens as much as possible — thus by taking the least risk with the guarantees that have been provided,” Gapany said.

Despite the talk, few concrete results were expected from the session, which is primarily to flesh out ideas — and possibly some vitriol — from lawmakers who all face reelection this fall.

Yvan Lengwiler, an economics professor at the University of Basel, suggested that the debate would play into a longtime “tug-of-war” between lawmakers who have lobbied in favor of Swiss banks over the years and others who have long sought to stiffen regulation.

“It seems that the pendulum, after this debacle we’ve seen, has clearly shifted towards strengthening,” he said. “Two years from now … the political situation might be very different, and it could be quite difficult to get this through parliament.”

Jakob Stark, an upper-house lawmaker from the populist, right-wing Swiss People's Party, said the rescue of Credit Suisse was “was probably right and ultimately unavoidable” but that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority — known as FINMA — must become ”more decisive.""

“It should, for instance, get the authority to impose fines, but then it should also really impose the fines, and particularly on the big institutions,” Stark said of the regulator. ""My feeling is that it was too considerate toward Credit Suisse, perhaps because of a legal basis that wasn’t sufficiently clear.”

The Swiss attorney general’s office has already opened a probe into events surrounding Credit Suisse ahead of the takeover, and the executive branch last week ordered tens of millions in cuts to the bonuses of top Credit Suisse executives.

Lawmakers largely were expected to line up behind the rescue plan — even if reluctantly for some — and were not yet expected to authorize a parliamentary investigation of the epochal rescue of Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old pillar of Swiss banking.

Lengwiler, who specializes in financial market regulation, noted that the combined bank will have a balance sheet that will be twice as large as Switzerland’s annual economy.

That’s nothing new: Both Credit Suisse and UBS had bigger balance sheets than the Swiss economy before the 2008 financial crisis. But this combined bank will be unprecedented in size and heft, presenting new challenges for government officials.

“What’s new here is that it’s the only kid on the block now,” Lengwiler said. “UBS is really the only game in town and … has become extremely dominant, and that is a problem for Switzerland.”

“It’s maybe too large for the country,” he added.

BERN (Reuters) -Switzerland's upper house of parliament voted on Tuesday after a heated debate to approve retrospectively the 109 billion Swiss francs ($120.5 billion) in financial guarantees used to rescue Credit Suisse last month.

Lawmakers were recalled for a rare extraordinary session to discuss the rapid rescue of Credit Suisse and the Swiss government's open chequebook response to a collapse which many in the country have blamed on top management.

A shotgun marriage which saw Credit Suisse taken over by Zurich-based rival UBS for 3 billion Swiss francs and propped up with more than 250 billion Swiss francs in guarantees and support has been the subject of widespread criticism.

But 29 of Switzerland's 46-member Council of States upper house approved the measure. The Swiss parliament's lower house is scheduled to vote on the matter later on Tuesday in a session likely to go until midnight local time (2200 GMT).

The votes are, however, largely symbolic as the state has committed the funds and lawmakers cannot overturn that decision.

In the lead-up to the merger last month, Swiss emergency law was used so that a sub-group of six members of parliament approved the financial commitment on behalf of the legislative body, to the ire of the almost 250 lawmakers left without a say.

""The use of emergency law has reached a level in the last three years that is beginning to annoy me,"" Hansjoerg Knecht, a member of Parliament's upper house, said.

Calling the situation where the legislative body can only approve the already committed credits ""unsatisfactory"", Knecht said if Credit Suisse were to require more cash, there should be no use of emergency law to bypass parliament.

'LOTS OF QUESTIONS'

Switzerland's finance minister had addressed the Council of States before the vote and acknowledged the ire being voiced.

""I heard anger, I heard frustration, sometimes I also heard a bit of helplessness,"" Karin Keller-Sutter said, adding that the merger between historic cross-town rivals Credit Suisse and UBS was not a forced marriage, but one of convenience.

NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) engaged in a months-long debate over the severity of reporting deficiencies that led the Swiss bank to delay its annual report last month.

Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) said in March it had postponed the annual filing after a ""late call"" with the regulator which raised questions about earlier financial statements.

Correspondence published in the SEC's online database on Tuesday show that agency staff first raised questions with Credit Suisse officials in July 2022.

Credit Suisse and the SEC declined to comment.

At issue were changes Credit Suisse made to how it booked a series of cash flows, including share-based compensation and foreign exchange hedges, and if control deficiencies needed to be disclosed to its audit committee or escalated to investors.

""Management believes it is prudent to briefly delay the publication of its accounts in order to understand more thoroughly the comments received,"" Credit Suisse said at the time of the delay on March 9.

The last-minute delay concerned analysts and sent Credit Suisse shares to near an all-time low. The back-and-forth between the bank and the U.S. regulator extended into another week as turmoil gripped the banking sector.

As recently as March 10, the SEC asked the bank to explain how it decided that an ""entity-level material weakness did not exist"" for its 2021 and 2022 financial years.

Material weaknesses are considered the most serious of such control failures. In previous letters to the SEC in August and November, Credit Suisse's former chief financial officer David Mathers and his successor Dixit Joshi described the failings as ""deficiencies"", which are considered to be less serious.

In the March 10 letter to Joshi, SEC staff acknowledged discussions with the bank on March 8-10. Joshi responded on March 12, saying in a letter that the firm noted the concerns and had reassessed its position.

""We will report that we have, and have had, a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting..."" he said in the letter posted on the SEC online database.

Credit Suisse notified shareholders of the weaknesses in its annual report on March 14, the day before it was granted a liquidity lifeline by the Swiss National Bank.

This proved insufficient and on March 19, the bank's takeover by Swiss rival UBS was announced.

The SEC's chief accountant in March 2022 warned public companies away from a bias toward deeming accounting errors immaterial for investors.

Material weaknesses are unusual among large, sophisticated companies, said Miguel Angel Minutti-Meza, accounting department chair at the University of Miami.

""Once you get to the top bracket, it is very rare to see these issues,"" he said. ""Investors will wonder: how could you not fix these?""

ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse has already paid back some of the emergency liquidity offered by the Swiss National Bank (SNB), data suggested on Tuesday, signaling an ebbing of the liquidity crisis which triggered the lender's fall.

Sight deposits - cash held by commercial banks overnight with the SNB - fell by 31 billion Swiss francs ($34.3 billion)last week, data published by the central bank showed.

The drop was the second-biggest weekly decline on record, second only to when the SNB started mopping up market liquidity after it quit negative interest rates last September.

In recent weeks sight deposits have soared as Credit Suisse received emergency liquidity infusions to head off a bank run as nervous customers pulled out their cash.

The lender last month said it intended to borrow up to 50 billion francs from the SNB in a last-ditch attempt to save itself after confidence evaporated following a string of blunders.

Following a state-sponsored takeover by rival UBS, another 200 billion francs in liquidity was also made available by the SNB.

As a result sight deposits rose from 515 billion in mid March to peak at 567 billion francs as the SNB deposited the cash with Credit Suisse, an upward trend which reversed last week as sight deposits fell to 532 billion francs.

Credit Suisse, the SNB and UBS declined to comment on the development.

Karsten Junius, an economist at J.Safra Sarasin, said the decline could be attributed to Credit Suisse paying back some of the emergency liquidity it took and no longer needing to draw on the central bank support.

""Confidence in the bank has been restored by the UBS merger, and from this data it would appear customer outflows have stopped,"" Junius said.

""A bank run has been stopped by the SNB coming in and offering massive liquidity and customers are reassured by UBS being there too. Credit lines from other banks would also appear to have been re-established.""

The SNB may also have been active in forex markets, selling some of its foreign currencies to prop up the franc, an activity which would have seen sight deposits decline as the SNB received francs from commercial banks in return.

But this was likely to be minor, Junius said, saying the SNB only sold foreign currencies worth 27 billion in the last three months of 2022.

""It's extremely unlikely the SNB sold more than 30 billion of forex just last week,"" Junius said. ""Confidence has been restored – the rescue seems to have done the trick. It seems to have been a successful operation.""

By Noele Illien

ZURICH (Reuters) -Swiss lawmakers resumed their debate over the rescue of Credit Suisse on Wednesday after they failed to reach an agreement a day earlier, taking the game of ping pong between parliament's two chambers into a second day.

While the upper house approved the government's 109 billion Swiss franc ($120.82 billion) contribution to the rescue package, parliament's lower, and larger chamber, later rejected it.

Seeking a compromise, the upper house passed changes to the measure on Wednesday morning, which the lower house will vote on later in the day.

If it rejects it again, the government will fail to get parliament's stamp of approval for its hastily cobbled together response to Credit Suisse's demise.

""It doesn't really matter what we decide in detail, but it would really send a bad signal if these loans were rejected,"" said Eva Herzog, who is a member of the Council of States, the upper house.

The vote is, however, largely symbolic.

The government had already committed the financial guarantees, using emergency law to largely bypass the legislative body in a move that has angered politicians.

Heated debates held in the country's four national languages continued into early morning hours, with lawmakers fuelling themselves with raclette, hard boiled eggs left over from Easter and wine.

As they returned on Wednesday, the upper house passed changes, which include a proposal for Switzerland's federal government to draft an amendment to the country's Banking Act. Its aim would be to reduce the risks posed by systemically relevant banks, such as Credit Suisse and UBS for Switzerland, by, for example, raising capital requirements and restricting bonuses.

Speaking in parliament on Wednesday, finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter said lawmakers needed to consider what sort of a financial centre Switzerland wanted to be and what message their rejection of the rescue would send to the world.

""What signal do you want to give internationally, are the institutions reliable, do you value financial market stability in a place where you already have a financial centre with a certain importance?""

Lawmakers were recalled to the country's capital, Bern, for the rare extraordinary session to discuss the rapid rescue of Credit Suisse and the Swiss government's open chequebook response to a collapse that many in the country have blamed on top management.

A shotgun marriage which saw Credit Suisse taken over by rival UBS for 3 billion Swiss francs and propped up with more than 250 billion Swiss francs in guarantees and support has drawn widespread criticism.

In the lead-up to the merger last month, Swiss emergency law was used so that a sub-group of six members of parliament approved the financial commitment on behalf of the legislative body, to the ire of the almost 250 lawmakers left without a say.

""The use of emergency law has reached a level in the last three years that is beginning to annoy me,"" Hansjoerg Knecht, a member of Parliament's upper house, said on Tuesday.

Speaking ahead of the vote on Tuesday, Keller-Sutter acknowledged the frustration.

""I heard anger, I heard frustration, sometimes I also heard a bit of helplessness,"" Karin Keller-Sutter said, adding that the merger between historic cross-town rivals Credit Suisse and UBS was not a forced marriage, but one of convenience.

Die Verzögerung des Berichts trug dazu bei, den Absturz der Credit Suisse zu beschleunigen, der schließlich zur Notübernahme durch den Lokalrivalen UBS Group AG führte. Die Finma gab nicht an, wann genau sie erstmals von der Korrespondenz zwischen der Bank und der Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) erfahren hat.

“Die gravierende Dimension der Beurteilung durch die SEC und die damit notwendige Verschiebung der Berichterstattung wurde der Finma... erst kurz vor der Veröffentlichung der Jahreszahlen im März 2023 bekannt”, teilte die Behörde auf Anfrage von Bloomberg News mit.

Weitere Artikel von Bloomberg auf Deutsch:

Aus jüngst veröffentlichter Korrespondenz zwischen SEC und Credit Suisse geht hervor, dass die SEC die Bank bereits seit Juli letzten Jahres — also rund acht Monate bevor die Aktionäre davon unterrichtet wurden — zu ihren internen Kontrollen und möglichen Abhilfemaßnahmen befragt hat.

“Es ist nicht unüblich, dass ausländische Behörden Fragen an Schweizer Banken richten”, so die Finma in ihrer Antwort auf die Fragen von Bloomberg. “Es ist klar, dass eine Bank über funktionierende Kontrollprozesse verfügen und solche Fragen von ausländischen Behörden rechtzeitig klären muss. Das war hier nicht der Fall.”

Wesentliche Fehler

Die SEC hatte die Bank zu Revisionen in den Kapitalflussrechnungen der Jahre 2019 und 2020 befragt und sie aufgefordert, die Fehler vollständig zu beschreiben, auch wer sie wann festgestellt hat. Die Bank hatte die Revisionen in ihrem Geschäftsbericht für 2021 offengelegt.

Die Korrespondenz zwischen der Bank und der SEC zog sich über Monate hin — auch weil sie mit der komplexen Restrukturierung der Credit Suisse einherging.

Die Bank spielte in Schreiben an die SEC die Schwere der Probleme zunächst herunter und argumentierte, dass die Fehler nicht wesentlich seien. Die SEC ließ sich jedoch nicht darauf ein und bestand auf Erläuterungen für die Ansicht der Bank, dass keine wesentlichen Schwachstellen vorlagen. “Wir räumen ein, dass die Kontrollmängel über mehrere Jahre hinweg nicht behoben wurden”, schrieb die Credit Suisse schließlich an die SEC.

Die Finma wurde am Dienstag und Mittwoch auch im Schweizer Parlament kritisiert, das sich mit der Rolle von Regierung und Behörden bei der Rettung der Credit Suisse beschäftigte. Der Nationalrat weigerte sich letztlich, dem Deal nachträglich seinen Segen zu geben.

UBS-Credit Suisse merger: The US Federal Reserve on Friday approved UBS Group AG taking over US subsidiaries of Credit Suisse Group. The US Fed said that the UBS Group had sought its approval to the deal on March 22.

As part of the deal, UBS will provide the Fed with “an implementation plan” for combining the US businesses of the two firms. The plan will be updated quarterly and will include UBS’ obligations to comply with more stringent “enhanced prudential standards”, the Fed said on Friday.

In a statement, the US Fed said the plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution. As per rules, the US central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

Last month, after the sudden collapse of US-based Silicon Valley Bank, investors lost confidence in Credit Suisse, which is Switzerland’s largest bank. In a matter of few days, Swiss authorities announced that UBS would buy Credit Suisse to contain further banking turmoil after the global lender had come to the brink of collapse. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets. Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

Besides the US, UBS secured temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, according to a report in Reuters.

Earlier this month, UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said that the unexpected takeover of rival Credit Suisse a significant milestone for Switzerland and for the global financial industry, which carries a “huge amount of risk”.

Addressing the annual shareholder meeting on April 5, Kelleher said that the takeover will take at least three to four years to take shape, excluding Credit Suisse’s non-core investment bank portfolio, which will have more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Describing the transaction as ""the first merger of two globally systematically important banks,"" Kelleher said the takeover ""means a new beginning and huge opportunities ahead for the combined bank and for the Swiss financial center as a whole.""

“Having a clear vision and a sound strategy is important….This transaction is the first merger of two global systemically important banks. This is not in any way an easy deal to do and brings with it execution risk,” Kelleher said.

A day before, Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann, while addressing the last AGM of the flagship bank, apologised to the shareholders for failing to contain the crisis, which led to its closure. In an emotional speech at Credit Suisse's last annual general meeting, chairman Axel Lehmann spoke of being caught off guard, pain, bitterness, accumulated scandals, and the grief that remains.

However, he said it would be business as usual in the short term.

Sources told TOI that Cognizant, TCS and Wipro have deals with Credit Suisse, amounting collectively to as much as $350-400 million annually. The remaining slice of the outsourcing pie is shared between Infosys, Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech.

""It's good to assume there will be change. The way the regulators structured the deal (UBS taking over Credit Suisse) has brought in stability. All the existing work that's being done in countries, in technology and operations, all of that is continuing as business as usual. In two quarters, we will pitch to them (UBS) how they can leverage synergies,"" he said. He expects more business from the integration.

In the March quarter, TCS signed $10 billion in total contract value, out of which $3 billion came from banking & financial services. Revenue grew a modest 0.6% in constant currency compared to the preceding quarter, weighed by banking and financial services. ""After the SVB (Silicon Valley Bank) collapse, customers became a bit tentative. They want to do projects, but they want to spend wisely. If they don't do anything in six months, given the pace at which technology changes, they will become a legacy company very quickly. They have deferred a few projects which have impacted our revenue,"" he said.

Subramaniam said banks are focusing on cost-optimisation by simplifying the organisation. ""The whole approach is to kill reconciliation. In each bank, there are thousands of people doing reconciliation work in the back office. They don't need them if they optimise using tech. With newer technologies like generative AI, there are opportunities to co-innovate and cocreate,"" he added.

Subramaniam said he doesn't anticipate the chain reaction that was pronounced in the banking and financial services space during the great financial crisis of 2008.

He said the company is giving 15-20% increments for top performers, 10-15% for good performers, and 5-7% for average performers. ""Average hikes are 8-12%. We have rolled out hikes effective April 1, and gave 100% variable pay for last quarter,"" he said.",[],

BlackRock's Financial Markets Advisory group has been selling off securities over the last two weeks, including pieces of collateralized loan obligations, commercial mortgage bonds and niche asset-backed debt, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

BlackRock and Credit Suisse declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.

The move comes after the Swiss lender was acquired by UBS Group AG in a state-brokered deal.

Earlier this month, U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) retained BlackRock's unit to sell the securities portfolios it kept in receivership after the collapse of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank.

In March, law firm Pallas Partners told Reuters that they along with a Swiss council were working on possible legal action on behalf of some Credit Suisse AT1 bond investors whose holdings were wiped out following the bank's takeover.

(MUFG) displayed near a MUFG Bank Ltd. branch in Tokyo, Japan, on Wednesday, Jan. 25, 2023. Japan's mega banks are scheduled to release its third-quarter earnings figures next week.

(Bloomberg) -- Clientes acaudalados de Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (MUFG) perdieron más de US$700 millones con los bonos de mayor riesgo de Credit Suisse Group AG adquiridos a través de la corredora que el banco japonés tiene con Morgan Stanley, según personas familiarizadas con el asunto.

El grupo bancario más grande de Japón celebra actualmente reuniones de funcionarios sénior para analizar el asunto, mientras habla con aproximadamente 1.500 clientes que perdieron un total combinado de 95.000 millones de yenes (US$717 millones), dijeron las personas, que pidieron no ser nombradas porque la información es privada.

Si bien MUFG no es la única empresa que quedó atrapada en la debacle de Credit Suisse, este recuento de pérdidas ilustra cuán gravemente fueron impactados por la amortización los clientes de un banco principal de inversión. Los bonos de Credit Suisse, conocidos como bonos adicionales de nivel 1 (AT1), fueron comprados por clientes de Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co.

Un portavoz del banco confirmó las pérdidas.

MUFG también está verificando que los gestores de patrimonio en la correduría —una de las dos empresas conjuntas entre la institución japonesa y el gigante de Wall Street— explicaron adecuadamente a los compradores los riesgos asociados con la deuda, dijo el vocero.

El suceso ilustra cómo las consecuencias del rescate de Credit Suisse por parte del rival UBS Group AG y la pérdida resultante de unos 16.000 millones de francos suizos (US$18.000 millones) de sus bonos AT1 se siente en las finanzas mundiales. El acuerdo para salvar el banco borró el valor de los bonos, lo que permitió a los accionistas de Credit Suisse recuperar algo de valor.

Los bonos AT1 eran riesgosos. Algunos titulares argumentan que fueron tratados de manera injusta y están buscando soluciones por vías jurídicas.

Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley busca aumentar las ganancias a través de servicios de gestión de fortunas en Japón, donde los bancos compiten cada vez más para administrar una porción mayor de los activos financieros de los hogares del país.

“Lamentamos mucho la preocupación que causamos a nuestros clientes”, dijo Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley por correo electrónico. “Seguiremos ofreciendo explicaciones exhaustivas a los clientes que se han visto afectados”.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse and UBS must freeze any job cuts planned as part of their emergency merger, the Swiss Bank Employees' Association (SBPV) said on Monday, in an open letter to the country's parliament.

SBPV managing director Natalia Ferrara has written to lawmakers to demand they consider staff affected by the collapse of Credit Suisse and halt any job losses until the end of 2023.

""We ... call on you to support our demand for a freeze on layoffs by the end of 2023 in parliament,"" Ferrara wrote in the letter published by newspaper Blick on Monday.

""Politicians must not shirk responsibility,"" she added.

The Swiss parliament is due to meet in extraordinary session on Tuesday to discuss the state-sponsored rescue of Credit Suisse which took place last month.

UBS agreed to buy Zurich rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.31 billion) in a deal engineered by the government, the central bank and market regulator to avoid a meltdown in the country's financial system.

""For the past three weeks, many of the approximately 17,000 employees at Credit Suisse and the 22,000 UBS employees have been looking at their future with uncertainty,"" said Ferrara, referring to the staff numbers in Switzerland.

Credit Suisse employs 45,000 people globally, while UBS has 74,000 in total.

""In the public debate about the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, there is a lot of talk about numbers, money, regulation, 'too big to fail' or bonuses,"" Ferrara wrote.

""But the affected employees of the two banks remain only a side note.

""That needs to change.""

UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti last week warned there would be ""change and hard decisions"" ahead following the takeover.

The giant bank created could reduce its workforce by 20%-30%, it has been reported by Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger, with 11,000 jobs being cut in Switzerland.

UBS has said it is too early to speculate on job cuts.

Ferrara said it was not the fault of the bank employees that the rescue was required, adding it would take months for UBS's plans to be worked out.

""Now it is time for the affected employees of the two banks to be given protection and respect,"" Ferrara wrote.

""It must not be the case that parliament debates money and technical aspects of the CS rescue for days during the extraordinary session and the people affected are forgotten.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Macquarie Group has hired Credit Suisse's top Australian dealmaker Dragi Ristevski, according to a memo from the bank.

Ristevski has been Credit Suisse's head of investment banking and capital markets. He will join Macquarie as the investment bank's head of financial sponsors for Asia Pacific, the memo said.

A Macquarie spokesman confirmed the contents of the memo.

Ristevski joined Credit Suisse in 2021 after spending 11 years at Citigroup where he earned a reputation as one of Australia's top private equity investment bankers.

He hired a number of senior bankers at Credit Suisse in an attempt to compete more aggressively alongside the bulge bracket firms in Australia.

In the memo, Macquarie Capital executive director Tim Joyce said Ristevski had advised high profile clients such as Bain, PEP, KKR, Quadrant and TPG on takeover deals in the region.

By John Revill and Noele Illien

ZURICH/BERN, April 14 (Reuters) - Switzerland's tradition of dependable consensus politics has taken a battering after the government used an emergency law to push through a state-backed mega-merger of UBS and Credit Suisse , sidelining the country's parliament.

Switzerland's two parliamentary chambers voted to reject the government's 109 billion Swiss francs ($122.82 billion) in aid for the deal between the country's two biggest banks, delivering a slap in the face for government.

The defeat is symbolic as it cannot change the merger, but it is a blow for the government in an election year and makes it harder to build broad support among the population for the biggest corporate rescue in Swiss history.

The use of emergency laws, in which shareholders and parliamentarians have no say, will also damage the standing of Switzerland's financial industry abroad, analysts have said, especially as it faces rising competition from other financial centers like Singapore.

The Swiss political model is under pressure at the moment, said political scientist Michael Hermann, a director of pollsters Sotomo, adding that the foreign perception of Switzerland as business friendly and as a financial safe haven could be undermined.

""Legitimacy in Swiss politics has been weakened, People who worried about an over powerful government during COVID will see their fears confirmed,"" said Hermann.

""This is damaging for the trust in democracy – parliament says no, but the emergency credits still go through.""

A recent Sotomo poll showed two thirds of the population was against the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse, while a third of respondents were angry that emergency laws had been used to bypass parliament.

The affair has already boosted support for populist right wing groups like the anti-immigrant Swiss People's Party (SVP) and the libertarian Aufrecht Schweiz movement in local elections since the takeover. Both parties are looking to make gains in national elections in October.

PARLIAMENT 'CIRCUMVENTED'

The Credit Suisse/UBS merger marked the first time that parliament had withheld its support for emergency laws designed to deal quickly with crises.

The facility to act without parliamentary approval, introduced in 2000, was used during the COVID pandemic to enforce restrictions and again last year to provide a Swiss energy producer with a credit line.

In the lead-up to the UBS/Credit Suisse merger last month, Swiss emergency law allowed a sub-group of six members of parliament to approve a cabinet plan to give financial aid on behalf of the legislative body, angering the almost 250 lawmakers, who were left without a say.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter defended the use of the emergency powers, saying Switzerland was not an ""emergency dictatorship.""

""We don't do it for fun. We really didn't know what else to do,"" Keller-Sutter told parliament during a stormy emergency session this week. ""The emergency law is based on the federal constitution and I don't think it's correct to say it's illegal.""

Lawmakers were dismayed.

""It has not been a great moment for Swiss democracy. It is terrible parliament has been put in this position and basically circumvented,"" said Roger Nordmann, leader of the Social Democrat group in the Swiss lower house told Reuters.

The Swiss government said it would take into account the rejection by parliament, but stressed the success of the takeover of Switzerland's second biggest bank - intended to prevent a financial meltdown - was paramount.

Industry experts said the deal was unlikely to be changed by politicians, with UBS being given a free hand to determine how many jobs will go and what will be done with Credit Suisse's valuable domestic retail banking business.

Swiss media has reported that the takeover could result in the combined bank cutting its Swiss workforce by up to 30%, which could cost 11,000 jobs.

""Despite the anger, most policy-makers do not want to interfere in the merger, to create and bear the risk that the merger does not succeed,"" said Hans Gersbach, co-director of the KOF economic research institute at ETH Zurich.

""Politicians might have wanted to show their disapproval about what happened, but they don’t want the UBS takeover to fail.""

Ultimately, 209 billion Swiss francs are being provided as state and central bank guarantees and support in the plan drawn up by the seven-strong Swiss cabinet, which has members from four political parties.

The amount is equivalent to around a quarter of Switzerland's entire economic output, and includes emergency liquidity injections and a state pledge to absorb up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS, based on documents outlining the deal.

Peter Kunz, an expert in economic law at the University of Bern, said the lawmakers were ultimately powerless to change it. ""In Switzerland, we often pat ourselves on the back for having the oldest democracy in the world. Yet seven people decided on 250 billion francs of support, an unimaginably huge sum of money,"" he said.

""And the parliament has no say in the matter. The use of such emergency legislation, overturning antitrust rules, is a problem for Swiss democracy and rule of law. It calls Swiss democracy into question."" ($1 = 0.8875 Swiss francs) (Reporting by John Revill, additional reporting John O'Donnell. Editing by Jane Merriman)",[],

By Hannah Lang, Chris Prentice and Ann Saphir

April 14 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's Board of Governors on Friday said it has approved UBS Group AG's acquisition of the U.S. subsidiaries of Credit Suisse, clearing another major hurdle for the completion of the Swiss-brokered rescue deal.

UBS has committed to give the U.S. central bank an implementation plan for combining its U.S. business and operations with those of Credit Suisse within three months of consummating the deal, the Fed's Board said in a statement. The plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution, the statement said.

The U.S. central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

After years of scandal and losses, 167-year-old Credit Suisse came to the brink of collapse before Zurich-based rival UBS rode to the rescue with a merger engineered and bankrolled by the Swiss authorities last month. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

The Swiss authorities and UBS Group AG have been racing to close the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG within as little as a month, in an effort to retain the lender's clients and employees, Reuters previously reported.

UBS secured a temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, people familiar with the process told Reuters.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

The Fed subjects firms with more than $700 billion in assets, or more than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activities, to heightened supervision, including annual company-run stress tests and increased liquidity standards.

Stefan Wermuth/Bloomberg

The Federal Reserve Board of Governors approved UBS's acquisition of Credit Suisse's U.S. business on Friday afternoon.

The acquisition of Credit Suisse's New York-based holding company is part of UBS's $3.25 billion acquisition of its distressed domestic rival. The combination of the two banks was brokered by the Swiss government and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority last month to preempt Credit Suisse's collapse.

UBS's acquisition of Credit Suisse came at a tumultuous time in the global banking industry following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Credit Suisse had a long, well-documented history of regulatory problems and appeared to be in danger of collapse before the deal was struck.

The Swiss National Bank supported the acquisition by providing liquidity to UBS on March 19. To help facilitate the transaction and provide support to other central banks around the world, the Fed enhanced its dollar liquidity swap facility that same day.

UBS's acquisition of Credit Suisse will result in ""more stringent enhanced prudential standards, including liquidity standards,"" the Fed said in a press release issued Friday.

UBS's U.S. subsidiary, UBS Americas Holding, has nearly $202 billion of assets under management, according to the U.S. Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, making it the 22nd largest bank holding company in the country.

As part of its approval, the Fed will allow UBS to keep the assets from Credit Suisse Holdings USA in a separate holding company for one year, after which they will have to be consolidated. Those Credit Suisse assets total more than $57 billion, according to the FFIEC.

Credit Suisse's Americas business includes investment banking, private banking, corporate debt underwriting and asset management.

Following the consolidation under a single holding company, UBS's U.S. operation will be upgraded from Category III to Category II under the Fed's regulatory tailoring rules. Such a change would bring with it requirements for annual company-run stress testing and ""advanced approaches"" to risk-based capital requirements.

Upon completion of the deal, UBS will have three months to provide the Fed with a plan for how it will adapt to the new regulatory and supervisory standards that come with the change in categorization.

UBS's implementation plan must also outline the structural organization of its consolidated U.S. operations, including whether branches will be consolidated or closed.

UBS will then have to provide quarterly updates to the Fed's Board of Governors in Washington as well as to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on its progress in implementing the plan.

Until the assets are combined, UBS will have to treat the two holding companies as distinct entities and will be responsible for ensuring that both meet all the regulatory requirements, the Fed noted.","['Stefan Wermuth Bloomberg', 'Staff Writer', 'American Banker']",2023-04-14 21:04:45.921000
https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/parliament-symbolically-rejects-credit-suisse-deal/ar-AA19Qneo,Parliament symbolically rejects Credit Suisse deal,"By EARLE GALE in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2023-04-14 09:33

Lawmakers in Switzerland's Parliament have symbolically rejected a deal brokered by the government last month, in which investment bank UBS took over troubled rival Credit Suisse, thanks largely to guarantees from the country's central bank.

The deal, reached on March 19,saw UBS assume control of the 167-year-old institution for $122 billion, thanks to a weekend of frantic activity after the bank got into trouble.

Fearing Credit Suisse's full meltdown and wider financial chaos, the Swiss government ensured the deal was in place.

The deal, which involved a$111-billion liquidity lifeline from the Swiss National Bank and an$11-billion guarantee from the Swiss government against any losses UBS may incur because of the takeover, was debated by lawmakers on Wednesday.

Alain Berset, president of Switzerland's federal council, urged them to support it, saying: ""Time was running out and the situation was deteriorating from hour to hour.""

He said the bank would surely have failed on either March 20 or March 21 if the government had not acted, causing ""an international financial crisis with devastating effects for our country"".

But lawmakers in the lower house of Switzerland's Parliament overwhelmingly rejected the intervention, by 103 votes to 71, with 8 abstaining.

Their opposition changed nothing, however, because the Swiss government intervened under an emergency law and did not need parliamentary approval.

After the symbolic vote, Switzerland's finance ministry said: ""This decision has no impact on the takeover of Credit Suisse decided on March 19.""

German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle, or DW, said the Swiss government added that ""the finance delegation of the Swiss Parliament"" gave its ""binding approval"" to the deal ""on behalf of Parliament, due to the urgency of the matter"".

DW said the government's action without first seeking approval from lawmakers seems, however, to have angered many ordinary people because Swiss voters are used to being consulted on important issues through frequent referendums.

And, despite the vote's lack of teeth, Eva Herzog, a lawmaker in the Swiss Parliament's upper house, told The Associated Press news agency that a rejection of the government's actions would ""really send a bad signal"".",[],

Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.

Oh, Switzerland — that beautiful land of financial stability, reliability and everything being just a little dull.

Not anymore. As Credit Suisse, Europe's 19th biggest lender, goes down the tubes, becoming the most dramatic banking casualty since the 2008 financial crisis, the worry now is it turns out to be the first domino in a chain that stretches round the world.

After all, we've been here before and it wasn't pretty.

And if boring, safe Switzerland can't save its banks, then, well, who the hell can?

To understand what happened, think of a shotgun marriage. On Sunday, the stricken Zurich-based lender was forced by Swiss authorities to get into bed with its longtime domestic rival UBS. It was historic. A 3 billion Swiss-francs deal that — for a few hours at least — allowed everyone to breathe a sigh of relief.

The aim was to protect investors and depositors and to stem a full-on banking crisis. Temporarily at least, that was achieved.

But as usual, the devil is in the detail. As the markets picked over the Credit Suisse corpse, alarm bells started to ring.

'Don't do this stuff'

The way the Swiss structured the rescue might have made things worse.

Since the crisis a decade and a half ago, regulators have tried to prevent financial institutions in distress from infecting each other with their problems by forcing losses onto bondholders (rather than depositors and ultimately the taxpayer).

But even those who held the riskiest type of bond were confident they wouldn't be affected until shareholders footed the bill first.

In the Credit Suisse case, Swiss regulators turned this normal way of doing things on its head, wiping out the bondholders first — and that has triggered financial panic across the system.

Credit Suisse was forced by Swiss authorities to get into bed with its longtime domestic rival UBS | Daniel Leal/AFP via Getty Images

""A few who had lines to regulators tried to stop them doing this stuff, for exactly this reason,"" an expert on bank liquidity at the International Monetary Fund told POLITICO on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.

It's the classic example of how contagion can spread throughout the system. If investors suddenly think their bonds are riskier than before, it can lead to a sell-off, pushing prices down and undermining confidence in the whole system.

If the unexpected wiping of these bondholders leads to their broad repricing, banks could see the cost of their financing go up substantially, adding to their troubles, bank analysts at JP Morgan warned.

In a bid to calm nerves after the Swiss decision, a trio of European oversight bodies — the Single Resolution Board, the European Banking Authority and the ECB's supervisory arm — released a joint statement to reassure investors that in case of a bank collapse in the EU, shareholders would suffer first.

And the Bank of England jumped on the bandwagon. “Holders of such instruments should expect to be exposed to losses in resolution or insolvency in the order of their positions in this hierarchy,” it said.

In other words: Please don't start panicking.

Same, but different

But Credit Suisse's collapse also raises serious questions over whether the system was quite as solid as the banking police thought it was in the first place.

According to all regulatory measures, the bank was well capitalized and had plenty of assets it could cash in. That could imply that the rules introduced in the wake of the 2008 crisis aren't as tight as people believed. And if that's the case, we could be headed for real trouble.

If there's solace to be found anywhere, it is in the uniqueness of Credit Suisse's case. Its troubles began long ago and have little similarity to the issues that brought down Californian lender Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) two weeks ago.

Swiss authorities confirmed the bank was not exposed to higher interest rates the way SVB was when they moved to backstop the bank with a 50 billion Swiss franc facility last Thursday.

It was when that reassurance failed to subdue the panic in the bank’s share price that markets turned to the bank’s broader reputational, culture and profitability issues.

Things came to a head last week when Saudi National Bank, one of Credit Suisse's most recent investors and partly owned by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, signaled it was not prepared to plow more capital into the group.

Spying scandal

Credit Suisse's difficulties go back even further. Under pressure to make its investment bank profitable as increased regulation clipped its wings, it recruited former insurance executive Tidjane Thiam as CEO in 2015 with a mandate to turn things around.

Thiam’s immediate response was to initiate a far-sweeping restructuring program cutting thousands of jobs, slashing costs and scaling back the investment banking division.

But the effort ran into trouble when the investment banking division struggled to keep up with its competitors and, worse still, became embroiled in a series of loss-making scandals, including a $5.5 billion loss related to the collapse of the Archegos hedge fund.

A spying scandal, in which the bank was carrying out surveillance of its own employees, forced the executive out.

Credit Suisse's board turned to Thomas Gottstein to be CEO. He promised to continue Thiam's efforts to restructure the bank, but acknowledged that more needed to be done to address deep-rooted cultural problems.

In 2021, it was rocked by its involvement with the failed finance firm Greensill Capital. The bank was once again forced to take a massive write-down and Gottstein had to quit.

A new plan was unveiled in 2022 under the helm of the bank’s most recent CEO, Ulrich Körner, which included further cuts to the investment banking division, as well as a renewed focus on wealth management and other core businesses. The bank also pledged to take steps to address its culture and risk management practices, in an effort to prevent future scandals.

But the onset of the Ukraine war and the imposition of sanctions choked its ability to service the wealth management needs of some of its wealthiest clients.

Plans to spin out the group’s investment division under a reinvigorated Credit Suisse First Boston brand operating out of New York hit a roadblock in February when it became clear the bank would struggle to find an investor to bankroll the operation on concerns about how creditors would be ranked in the event of a group-wide failure.

With no further runway left, a collapse looked like just a matter of time.","['More ...', 'European Banking Authority']",2023-03-20 20:05:54+00:00

The net margin for Credit Suisse Group AG stands at -34.26. The total capital return value is set at -1.17, while invested capital returns managed to touch -3.99. Equity return is now at value -16.30, with -1.10 for asset returns.

Based on Credit Suisse Group AG (CS), the company’s capital structure generated 459.20 points at debt to equity in total, while total debt to capital is 82.12. Total debt to assets is 39.00, with long-term debt to equity ratio resting at 292.03. Finally, the long-term debt to capital ratio is 52.22.

Conclusion

To sum up, Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) has seen a bad performance recently. Analysts have differing views on the stock, with some seeing it as a “sell” and others as a “hold”.

By Noele Illien

BERN (Reuters) -Switzerland's parliament rejected on Wednesday the government's 109 billion Swiss francs ($120.82 billion) aid for Credit Suisse's merger with UBS, leaving the fallen bank's hastily arranged rescue without a largely symbolic parliamentary blessing.

While the upper house had approved the government's contribution to the rescue package, parliament's lower, and larger chamber, pushed back again on Wednesday.

It had already rejected the proposals in a late night session on Tuesday, forcing the upper house to find a solution when it met again on Wednesday.

Seeking a compromise, the upper house passed changes to the measure on Wednesday morning, but it was not enough to sway the lower house lawmakers.

They turned it down by 103 votes to 71 in favour, a similar level of opposition to the night before.

Speaking just before the lower house vote, Cedric Wermuth, the co-president of the Social Democrats said the party just could not support the funding.

While the government's commitment, made using emergency law, cannot be overturned, the vote marks a symbolic rebuke for the authorities, whose decision to largely bypass the nation's legislative has angered many politicians.

""This decision has no impact on the takeover of Credit Suisse decided on March 19,"" the Swiss Finance Ministry said after the vote.

The support package had already been given binding approval by the parliament's finance delegation, due to the urgency of the matter, it said.

""The funds have already been fully committed,"" it added.

Lawmakers who backed an approval of the deal, voiced concern about Switzerland's image.

""It doesn't really matter what we decide in detail, but it would really send a bad signal if these loans were rejected,"" said Eva Herzog, who is a member of the Council of States, the upper house, before the vote.

Following a day of heated debates held in the country's four national languages, that continued into early morning hours, the upper house passed changes aimed at winning over the sceptics.

They included a proposal for Switzerland's federal government to draft an amendment to the country's Banking Act. Its aim would be to reduce the risks posed by systemically relevant banks, such as Credit Suisse and UBS for Switzerland, by, for example, raising capital requirements and restricting bonuses.

Addressing parliament before the vote on Wednesday, finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter told lawmakers to consider what message their rejection of the rescue would send to the world.

""What signal do you want to give internationally, are the institutions reliable, do you value financial market stability in a place where you already have a financial centre with a certain importance?""

Lawmakers were recalled to the country's capital, Bern, for the rare extraordinary session to discuss the Swiss government's open chequebook response to a collapse that many in the country have blamed on Credit Suisse's top management.

Last month's shotgun marriage which saw the bank taken over by rival UBS for 3 billion Swiss francs and propped up with more than 250 billion Swiss francs in guarantees and support has drawn widespread criticism.

The government invoked Swiss emergency law to sign it off to the ire of the almost 250 lawmakers left without a say.

""The use of emergency law has reached a level in the last three years that is beginning to annoy me,"" Hansjoerg Knecht, a member of Parliament's upper house, said on Tuesday.

GENEVA -- The Swiss government says it's ordered cuts to the bonuses of top executives of Credit Suisse, with nearly 1,000 managers being “deprived” of tens of millions combined as the troubled bank heads toward a forced merger with rival UBS.

The Federal Council, a seven-member panel that runs Switzerland's executive branch, announced Wednesday that it has instructed the Finance Department to cancel altogether or reduce by either one-half or one-quarter such bonuses due last year among the top three rungs of management.

That will amount to a loss of bonus pay totaling about 50 million to 60 million Swiss francs ($55 million to $66 million).

The move comes after Swiss authorities scrambled in mid-March to cobble together a 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.25 billion) sale to UBS of Credit Suisse, which suffered surging outflows of deposits and a plunge in its share price.

Two days after the deal was announced, the government said it was temporarily suspending bonus payouts to Credit Suisse employees.

Bonuses for top Credit Suisse managers also are set to be canceled or reduced this year. UBS executives hope to close the takeover deal in the coming months.

The rescue capped years of trouble at Credit Suisse — among 30 banks worldwide considered “systemically important” — after fears that it could fail and trigger an international financial crisis after the collapse of two U.S. banks.

In an indication of why not all bank employees were affected by the bonus changes, the Swiss executive branch said total deferred variable compensation, such as share awards, of Credit Suisse's 49,000 employees has sunk to 635 million francs ($700 million) — to about one-fourth of their total worth when initially awarded.

“In other words, all employees have already had to bear a total loss of more than 2 billion francs due to the drop in Credit Suisse’s share price,” it said.

The announcement comes a day after shareholders criticized Credit Suisse leaders, who apologized for failures of the 167-year-old lender. On Wednesday, UBS held its own annual shareholder meeting, where its chairman expressed confidence in the deal while still noting “huge"" risks.",['Abc News'],
https://www.msn.com/en-ph/news/other/swiss-president-backs-credit-suisse-takeover/ar-AA19JaJM,Swiss president backs Credit Suisse takeover,"BERN: Swiss President Alain Berset on Tuesday will defend the orchestrated takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS at an extraordinary session of parliament to debate the bank's collapse.

Berset's government played a leading role in arranging the merger of Switzerland's biggest banks a deal done in double-quick time behind closed doors on March 19.

The three-day session at the Federal Assembly in Bern was called after lawmakers found themselves before a fait accompli.

The takeover dramatically changes the financial landscape in the wealthy Alpine country, which stakes much of its national prestige on sound banking.

The merger triggered unease among the public and lawmakers alike, with the country's second-largest bank rapidly imploding after 167 years in which it helped finance Switzerland's industrial growth.

$120 billion in play

Amid fears of contagion following the collapse of three US regional banks, Credit Suisse's share price plunged despite reassurances from the central Swiss National Bank (SNB).

But that failed to restore investor confidence, and the government, the SNB and the Finma financial regulators, fearing a bloodbath when the markets reopened on March 20, strong-armed UBS into a $3.25-billion takeover on March 19.

""The alternative would have been a bankruptcy of Credit Suisse... accompanied by a probable collapse of the Swiss economy,"" Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter told Saturday's Le Temps newspaper.

Some 109 billion Swiss francs ($120 billion) have been put on the table between government guarantees and the liquidity the SNB made available.

In the heat of the moment, parliament's finance delegation had to authorize the credit release without lawmakers having a chance to debate and scrutinize the arrangements.

The National Council wants to examine the guarantees granted to prop up the rescue, the possibility of legal action against Credit Suisse's governing bodies and the regulation of banks considered ""too big to fail.""

All parties irked

The takeover has ruffled parties of all stripes, especially so given that the state already had to prop up UBS during the 2008 financial crisis.

The right-wing populist Swiss People's Party wants tighter regulations on too-big-to-fail banks, and a commitment from the government to hold Credit Suisse executives to account as well as the reimbursement of unwarranted bonuses.

Center-right party The Center thinks the takeover was not so much the worst option, but it wants clarity on the risks involved in creating a superbank.

The Greens want an assessment on whether Credit Suisse executives should be brought to justice.

The government has calmed some of the anger by stripping Credit Suisse's executive board of their 2022 and 2023 bonuses.

No repeat

The government last week also promised lawmakers a full report within a year looking at the factors behind Suisse's downfall.

During this week's session, lawmakers will have to endorse the guarantees, but the vote is only symbolic, said Samuel Bendahan, a National Council member and an economics professor at the University of Lausanne's business school.

Parliament cannot cancel the government's decision taken under emergency law, and ""the money has already been released anyway,"" the socialist lawmaker told Agence France-Presse (AFP).

""Parliament can only give a signal to say that next time it will not happen this way,"" he said.

However, he hoped the session would make it possible ""to vote on binding texts so that we do not find ourselves in this situation again in 10 years' time.""",[],

Hastily convened town halls and virtual meetings with senior executives do little to break a growing apathy.



Swiss bank employees have never faced anything like it. An almost unbelievable sense of helplessness following UBS's forced rescue of Credit Suisse. One employee at the Uetlihof, where 8,500 Credit Suisse staff are based, keeps it simple.

«Who wants to settle a mortgage or a corporate loan with us – or open an account», the employee frets.

So many things are still out there in the open. Among them, it is unclear who will be managing the relationship if the client had an account at both major Swiss banks. As one example of many, certain corporate clients who diversified their business risks by apportioning business between UBS and Credit Suisse are likely to choose one of the two in the future.

Thousand Cuts

«People have started to check out mentally», says the employee, noting the growing apathy at the bank. Hastily convened town halls and virtual meetings with senior executives do little to help. «They (management) talk a great deal but they say nothing when it comes down to it», the employee maintains, «as nobody really ostensibly knows anything.»

Lukas Gaehwiler's statement at the UBS annual general meeting last week has added to the general confusion. There, the vice chairman of Switzerland's largest bank, indicated that fully consolidating both entities in Switzerland could take up to three to four years. That would mean that the Credit Suisse brand would continue to exist for at least that amount of time. Many Credit Suisse employees took it akin to a death by a thousand cuts.

Cultural Filter



The situation was made even more difficult last week during the extraordinary session of the Swiss Federal Parliament in Berne when the Lower House twice rejected the emergency loans that were a key part of the deal. If anything, it is likely to delay future integration. «Do what you still need to do and do it as best as you possibly can and talk about it», are what some Credit Suisse team heads are indicating to their subordinates, «that is how you can best recommend yourself to your future employer.»

UBS chairman Colm Kelleher talked about a cultural «filter» during the appointment of Sergio Ermotti as the CEO of the new bank. It is a gauntlet Credit Suisse employees are going to have to run in the future combined entity. But the fear of somehow importing Credit Suisse culture, now clearly regarded as disastrous in hindsight, could prompt the decision makers at UBS to be particularly conservative. They may even veer away from the so-called one-third rule, according to a Zurich-based headhunter requesting anonymity given they are currently in touch with both banks.

Never Seen Before



The usual script for takeovers foresees the buyer taking in at least one-third of the employees of the entity that is being acquired, says Reto Jauch, the managing partner at the Zurich-based executive search firm Schulthess, Zimmermann & Jauch. That is in order to ensure that the new organization is functional from the outset.

Whatever the case, the cultural challenges of the deal are herculean. UBS is in the middle of transforming itself into an agile bank, which has been one of the main strategic imperatives of still CEO Ralph Hamers all the while Credit Suisse has been attempting to reform its risk culture from the ground up. Now, instead, in absolutely no time at all, both institutes are expected to consolidate their businesses into one. It is something that few have any experience or expertise within Switzerland, and certainly not on that scale.

No Consideration

Many experts agree that UBS has to act quickly. Otherwise, uncertainty will remain high, and that is something that will have an impact on the daily conduct of business. As employers, they have to provide clarity. The Zurich-based headhunter believes, however, that, despite that, they will show little consideration when it comes to job cuts: «Management knows that the public outcry will be short-lived but that the consequences from any overly tepid implementation could be very long and arduous», she indicates.

Employees that can quickly adapt to the new culture and outwardly represent it operationally will be chosen over others. Things look far less clear for bankers that have no direct contact with clients. UBS's takeover of Credit Suisse will also result in a great deal of management capacity entering the labor markets, says Jauch. «The Swiss bank sector will not be able to absorb this as it has in the past.»

Positive Aspects



According to brand expert, Florin Baeriswyl, it is important to communicate UBS's values and cultures to team members while also respecting the old Credit Suisse culture «for example, the values that Credit Suisse brings to the table as a bank for entrepreneurs». This needs to happen despite the current pressure on everyone.

«It is important to remember that a brand never belongs to one person or one company. The reputation of a brand is what people say about you when you are not in the room», Baeriswyl says. That is why, according to him, companies have to create a strong and credible image, something that both employees and clients can vouch for – and something that leaves a strong impression behind.

Outflows from Credit Suisse investment funds accelerated in the weeks following its historic merger with Swiss rival UBS, as reported by London's «Financial News» on Monday citing data from Morningstar.

Outflows from about 300 Credit Suisse funds domiciled in the EU and US reached $5.6 billion in the three weeks since the merger. Credit Suisse declined to comment.

Massive Outflows After Bailout

In the week leading up to the merger of the two banks, investors withdrew about three billion dollars from Credit Suisse funds. The massive outflows from the funds began on March 14, when the bank said it had discovered material weaknesses in its annual report, finews.com also reported. The bank came under pressure from the SEC regarding reporting deficiencies in prior annual reports

The largest daily outflows were recorded two days after the announcement of the landmark deal, on March 21, when $776 million was withdrawn from Credit Suisse's European funds.

Reversal in April

Despite steady outflows in recent weeks, Morningstar figures show Credit Suisse's European funds saw net inflows of more than $240 million on April 5 and 6, suggesting initial signs that investor nervousness is subsiding.

Much of the fund outflows in the days following the merger with UBS were likely by investors worried about the stability of the big bank and unsettled by the turmoil in the banking sector, according to Financial News.

Some outflows in recent weeks were due to Credit Suisse wealth management and asset management clients moving to other firms, according to observers.

Credit Suisse , one of the biggest investment banks in the world, could be dangerously close to causing a massive crash on the markets. Recently, ABC Australia shared a post about a major financial bank being on the brink of a default. The news outlet did not mention the name of the bank, but financial experts and economists suspected that it could be Credit Suisse, since its stock plunged by more than 60% through the year and tumbled from almost $10 to $3.95. Besides, the cost of the bank’s credit default swaps has skyrocketed, reaching the highest level since the 2008 market crash. The default of such a major bank will surely cause turbulence in high-risk markets, including the crypto market.

Per CryptoRank’s statistics, Bitcoin finished Q3 of this year down 2% from the previous quarter. Considering the beginning of October and the final quarter of 2022, the same statistics point to a potential closing of BTC quotes in the green zone, at least in comparison with the end of September. Since 2013, BTC has only declined three times in the final quarter: in 2014, 2018 and 2019. For the other six years, Bitcoin has consistently closed in the green, sometimes by more than 200% and 400%. Even last December, at the beginning of the current bear market, BTC managed to grow by 5.6% at the end of Q4. However, crypto analyst Willy Woo says that the current market structure is much different now. In addition, we still have not seen major sell-offs, and many large hedge funds appeared in the last two years.

Legal experts see otherwise.

After the Swiss federal government came to the rescue of Credit Suisse with a forced takeover by UBS, Swiss Federal Councillor and Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said billions of government funds granted through emergency legislation were «fully committed.» By taking that route, approval through an extraordinary session of parliament was to have been a formality.

Legal experts disagree. Articles 28 and 34 of the Financial Budget Act stipulate that «urgent» credits require not only prior approval of the finance delegation but also that of parliament, as reported by the «Blick am Sonntag» (in German) over the weekend.

The word «approval» is crucial, says University of Fribourg constitutional law professor Andreas Stoeckli, «It means that the parliament's decision has legally binding force.»

Legal Obligations

Bernhard Ruetsche, professor of public law at the University of Lucerne, agrees. In the context of the genesis of federal law, from the wording «subsequent approval,» it can be concluded, «that urgent commitment credits decided by the Federal Council with the approval of the finance delegation lose their legal validity if not approved by the Federal Assembly.»

Still, according to Ruetsche, legal obligations entered into by the Federal Council before non-approval by parliament remain in place due to the protection of legitimate expectations and legal clarity. The question is whether or not such obligations exist.

Tricky Situation

A default guarantee exists for the liquidity support from the SNB, goes the argument of the Federal Department of Finance (FDF). The situation is different for the loss protection for UBS in the amount of nine billion, which has not yet been contractually set. Stoeckli says that «Written form is a prerequisite for the guarantee of a contract. The relevant article in the emergency decree is not an obligation, but merely an authorization.»

He also says not all the essential points of the guarantee are contained there. Whether or not the Federal Council's declarations of intent have legal consequences for the federal government must be clarified in detail, Stoeckli said. It's a tricky situation because the deal could fall through if the Federal Council does not sign the contract. «But it is doubtful whether the Federal Council will be allowed to sign the contract at all after the parliament's 'no' vote.»

UBS declined to comment on whether it would seek to claim damages if there is no contract. Meanwhile, the FDF maintains that «the rejection has no impact on the guarantees.»

One National Councilor said that if the Finance Department's interpretation does not pass legal muster, «this is a scandal in terms of national policy» and if true, «Keller-Sutter must resign.»",[],2023-04-17 06:22:50

https://www.finews.com/news/english-news/56801-the-hidden-treasures-of-credit-suisse,The Hidden Treasures of Credit Suisse,"The federal government and supervisory authorities have forced UBS to take over Credit Suisse. In doing so it saddled UBS with several potential pitfalls. But hidden treasures also await the buyer.

It was hard to believe UBS chairman Colm Kelleher when he said on March 19 the takeover of Credit Suisse offered «tremendous opportunities.» The extraordinary session of the Swiss parliament over the past few days added fuel to doubts over the transaction. No fewer than ten proposals were adopted with twice as many motions further submitted, marking the start of significantly stricter regulation of the largest Swiss bank.

Huge Risks?

If the legal risks that UBS is assuming from Credit Suisse are added to the unknowns and costs of a four-year integration, observers have to conclude UBS has taken on considerable risk with the merger. Some clarity on the issue may be forthcoming soon. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (Finma) wants to wrap up enforcement proceedings on the Archegos debacle.

There is another view of the deal, at least on paper. UBS and its top management around Kelleher and new CEO Sergio Ermotti have surprising treasures waiting for them from their acquisition.

This is suggested by an analysis JP Morgan recently completed on UBS. The American bank is acting as an investment banking advisor to UBS in the takeover. These are the most surprising projections:

1. A New Julius Baer Every Three Years

According to the analysis, the acquisition of Credit Suisse will create a wealth management juggernaut. Once the integration is completed in 2027, two-thirds of the combined entities' pre-tax profit, estimated at seven billion dollars, would come from wealth management. In the business with wealthy private clients, the combined group would be in a position to collect $150 billion in new money every year. Such a haul of new money would create an equivalent to a new Bank Julius Baer every three years measured by client assets, the analysts write. These figures would make many a private bank CEO in Switzerland giddy.

2. Costs Can be Squeezed More Easily than Expected

The team around lead analyst Kian Abouhossein calculates that UBS's savings target of eight billion dollars by 2027 is not a very challenging one. Credit Suisse's investment bank alone generates annual costs of seven billion dollars, and UBS wants to wind down that business. The costs of job cuts are also likely to be limited. Voluntary staff turnover at UBS was 13 percent last year and slightly higher for Credit Suisse at 15 percent.

The combined bank is expected to incur legal risk costs of around five billion dollars by 2027. Overall, analysts expect net restructuring costs of $8.2 billion, so UBS could manage quite a precision landing between savings and expenses.

3. Swiss business is worth billions.

According to the calculations, Credit Suisse's Swiss business is expected to contribute about a third of the combined bank's pre-tax profits from 2027. However, UBS may decide to share this revenue with the public for several reasons. With an initial public offering of Credit Suisse Switzerland, UBS will reap at least ten billion dollars, according to JP Morgan. Such a scenario played out in 2015 when then-CEO Tidjane Thiam planned to take the unit that is now the Swiss Bank public in a partial IPO on Switzerland's SIX stock exchange.

4. Guardrail Against Setbacks

By acquiring Credit Suisse for three billion francs, when it was worth around 7.4 billion on the stock exchange, UBS created a cushion worth billions against setbacks from the start. Add to that extensive guarantees from the federal government and supervisory authorities worth at least 25 billion francs. This is due to the mandatory convertible bonds of Credit Suisse of 15.8 billion francs triggered by Finma, and direct government guarantees of at least nine billion francs.

Thanks to the writedown of mandatory AT1 convertibles, UBS will save interest costs incurred by Credit Suisse, a savings analysts estimate at one billion dollars per year.

5. Enormous Reservoir of Deferred Claims

Deferred tax assets arising in the US business are a highly complex factor, but UBS has repeatedly drawn from this resource in the past and used it to boost its net profit. In the future, the bank could continue to capitalize on such assets to smooth out any setbacks from the merger. With the sale of Credit Suisse's US business units, such a capitalization might even become necessary, JP Morgan analysts believe.

According to their calculations, Credit Suisse had no less than $60 billion in net tax loss carryforwards at the end of last year, but the bank's management hardly used any of it. At UBS, the tax loss carryforwards at the same time amounted to 32 billion dollars.",[],2023-04-14 05:00:01

https://nypost.com/2023/03/21/ubs-credit-suisse-takeover-could-layoff-tens-of-thousands/,Credit Suisse rescue reportedly could spur ‘tens of thousands’ of layoffs,"UBS Group’s emergency bailout of struggling lender Credit Suisse reportedly could result in “tens of thousands” of layoffs — and worried bankers are already said to be scrambling to contact recruiters.

The culling is expected to hit hardest at Credit Suisse’s operations in Switzerland and its investment bank, the Financial Times reported, citing sources familiar with UBS’s plans for the firm.

The report said the amount of lost jobs could be “as much as a third” of the 120,000 people employed at the combined operations of Credit Suisse and UBS.

“The takeover threatens job cuts on a scale that the labor market in the banking sector cannot absorb,” the Swiss Bank Employees’ Association said in a Tuesday statement, according to the outlet.

Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Korner and chair Alex Lehmann told staffers that no decisions have yet been made about potential layoffs.

Separately, a source told Bloomberg that the layoffs could amount to “multiples” of Credit Suisse’s current plan to slash 9,000 jobs, which was already in place before UBS took over the troubled lender.

Rumored layoffs have prompted an “unprecedented flood” of calls from Credit Suisse bankers to corporate headhunters and other firms as they look to secure new gigs ahead of the upheaval, Bloomberg reported, citing interviews with people at more than a dozen firms based in New York, London, Singapore and other cities.

One firm in Singapore told Bloomberg it had received calls from approximately 30 private bankers, mostly employed by Credit Suisse, on Monday alone.

A recruiter based in Hong Kong said they had fielded calls from more than 20 senior investment bankers over the last week, while another headquartered in London said inquiries were coming in “all weekend.”

“The best ones at Credit Suisse have probably already left,” Singapore-based recruiter Will Tan of Principal Partners told the outlet.

“There’s definitely not enough to go around for everyone,” Tan added.

Any ousted workers could face a difficult path to finding another job, given the current turmoil in the US banking system and abroad. Some banks, such as Goldman Sachs, have already conducted layoffs within the last few months.

Shares of Credit Suisse have cratered since last week, when top brass disclosed that they had discovered “material weaknesses” in the firm’s financial reporting over the last two years.

UBS’s government-brokered emergency rescue did little to assuage concerns, as Credit Suisse’s stock cratered by some 55% in the first day of trading after the announcement. UBS shares pared early losses and ended 1.2% higher on Monday.

The admission prompted a crisis of confidence among investors and raised fears of a collapse that could spread further contagion in a banking sector already rocked by the implosions of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank of New York.

“We are encouraging colleagues to continue to the best of their abilities against a difficult backdrop,” a Singapore-based Credit Suisse spokesperson told Bloomberg.

“Ultimately, we will do everything we can to ensure an orderly transition and to serve our clients as best as possible,” the spokesperson added.

UBS reportedly referred to its Sunday statement on the deal when asked for comment about the job situation.

“This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue,” UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said in the statement.

“We have structured a transaction which will preserve the value left in the business while limiting our downside exposure,” Kelleher added.

Credit Suisse declined to comment when reached by The Post.

The deal, which includes CHF 109 billion of federal government guarantees, was agreed by the Federal Council, Switzerland’s executive. This week Switzerland’s parliament rejected the CHF 109 billion federal government guarantee included in the deal.

The rushed deal included the federal government providing a CHF 9 billion backstop in favour of UBS against any losses incurred when selling certain Credit Suisse assets beyond the first CHF 5 billion. It also included the SNB providing up to CHF 100 billion of liquidity, which is guaranteed by the federal government, exposing Swiss taxpayers to a CHF 109 billion risk.

Despite a commission and the Council of States, Switzerland’s upper house, coming out in support of the CHF 109 billion guarantee, parliament rejected it by 102 votes to 71. The rejection was driven by no votes from the Swiss People’s Party (UDC/SVP) and the Socialist and Green parties, reported RTS.

The vote will not overturn the guarantees, which were made under emergency laws, however it represents a political blow to the Federal Council.

In addition, the affair has triggered significant anger and calls from politicians to make changes to the sector. Many pointed to the irresponsibility of bankers who had seemed to have learned nothing from the past. Calls were made to revise the rules around banks deemed too big to fail and to strengthen the powers of financial market regulator FINMA.

The Federal Council has announced it will produce a detailed report on the affair within a year.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/glebtsipursky/2023/03/24/the-collapse-of-credit-suisse-a-cautionary-tale-of-returning-to-the-office/,Credit Suisse’s Collapse: A Cautionary Tale Of Returning To The Office,"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 15: People walk by the New York headquarters of Credit Suisse on March ... [+] 15, 2023 in New York City. Getty Images

The world watched in shock as Credit Suisse, one of the most established global banking and financial services institutions, collapsed and was eventually acquired by UBS. A significant factor in Credit Suisse's downfall was its rigid stance on forcing staff to return to the office. This cautionary tale serves as a reminder for business leaders to adapt to the changing world of work and prioritize their workforce's needs and preferences.

The Iron Fist: Credit Suisse's Return to the Office Policy

In stark contrast to the growing trend of many companies embracing a flexible hybrid work approach, Credit Suisse took a more traditional approach, mandating that staff return to the office three days a week. According to one banker there, “they're removing our flexibility, and it doesn't feel great.”

The bank's leadership failed to recognize the fundamental shift in employee expectations and the value of flexible work arrangements. Despite several studies and real-world examples pointing to the benefits of hybrid work, Credit Suisse's top brass remained stubbornly attached to outdated work paradigms.

By forcing staff to return to the office, Credit Suisse demonstrated a lack of empathy for its employees' wellbeing and work-life balance. This disregard for employee needs resulted in decreased morale, heightened stress, and increased turnover rates. The bank lost talented individuals to competitors that embraced hybrid and remote work, which in turn weakened its competitive advantage.

Moreover, Credit Suisse's decision fueled resentment among its employees, who felt their preferences and needs were being disregarded. This led to a decline in engagement and commitment, ultimately impacting the bank's productivity and bottom line.

The Repercussions of a Stagnant Culture

Credit Suisse's insistence on returning to the office reflects an outdated organizational culture, one that clings to traditional ways of working despite the evidence supporting the benefits of hybrid and remote work. By failing to adapt to the changing landscape of work, Credit Suisse missed out on opportunities to innovate, collaborate, and remain competitive.

This stagnant culture ultimately played a significant role in the bank's collapse. Its inability to retain and attract top talent, coupled with the negative impact on employee morale and productivity, contributed to Credit Suisse's weakened position in the market.

As a result of its inability to adapt to the new normal and retain top talent, Credit Suisse's operations suffered. Its collapse had a ripple effect on the financial sector and served as a cautionary tale for other organizations. The bank's demise was a wake-up call for leaders worldwide, emphasizing the importance of embracing change and prioritizing employee wellbeing.

UBS's acquisition of Credit Suisse highlights the stark contrast between a company that understood the necessity of change and one that stubbornly clung to outdated practices. Consider that UBS adopted a much more flexible model of work arrangements, with some roles at the firm 100% remote, while others are a flexible hybrid modality. This approach came from a UBS survey that found 86% of its employees stated they valued more flexibility, including the ability to maintain a remote or hybrid work arrangement. UBS said that as technology enhancements and adoption of virtual work continue, it’s “finding new ways to engage with clients and build trusted relationships.” This is the kind of innovation that Credit Suisse was missing.

A Lesson in Adaptability: Embracing Hybrid Work

The collapse of Credit Suisse highlights the importance of adaptability in the ever-evolving world of work. By forcing employees to return to the office, the bank ignored the benefits of hybrid work and the shifting preferences of its workforce. As a cutting-edge expert in the field of hybrid and remote work, I have seen firsthand the advantages of embracing these work arrangements. Over the past few years, hybrid and remote work have revolutionized the way organizations function, allowing them to tap into global talent pools, reduce operational costs, and improve employee satisfaction. Companies that have successfully transitioned to hybrid or remote work have seen productivity gains and a better work-life balance for their employees.

To avoid a similar fate to Credit Suisse, business leaders must embrace the following principles:

Acknowledge the changing landscape: The world of work has undergone a seismic shift, with employees now expecting greater flexibility.

Embrace change: Rather than resisting new ways of working, leaders should be proactive in adapting to industry trends and exploring the benefits of hybrid and remote work. This not only ensures a competitive edge but also promotes a culture of innovation and flexibility.

Prioritize employee wellbeing: The well-being of employees should be at the forefront of any organizational decision. Leaders must consider the impact of their decisions on employee satisfaction, work-life balance, and mental health, as these factors directly impact productivity and overall company performance.

Communicate and engage: Transparent communication and regular engagement with employees is crucial to understanding their needs and preferences. By fostering an open dialogue, organizations can make informed decisions on work arrangements that best suit their workforce and business objectives.

Invest in technology and infrastructure: Supporting hybrid and remote work requires a robust technological infrastructure and the right tools to ensure seamless communication and collaboration among team members. Organizations must invest in the necessary systems to facilitate this new way of working.

Implement training and support: To help employees and managers adapt to hybrid and remote work, organizations should provide training, resources, and ongoing support. This includes educating employees on best practices for remote work and helping managers develop strategies for leading and managing hybrid teams.

Regularly reassess and adapt: The landscape of work is constantly evolving, and organizations should continually reassess their work arrangements and policies to ensure they remain relevant and effective. By staying agile and receptive to change, businesses can maintain a competitive edge and cultivate a resilient workforce.

The Collapse of SVB VB vs. UBS

For readers who may be skeptical that Credit Suisse's forced return to the office was a significant factor in the bank's collapse, it's worth noting the contrasting example of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which also collapsed. Many advocates of the return to office blamed SVB’s more flexible remote work policy for its failure due to weaker communication and collaboration.

Well, what’s good for the goose is good for the gander, right? If we blame SVB’s failure on its flexible work policy, the same logic suggests that the forced return to office is to blame for the failure of Credit Suisse. That’s especially the case considering the successful acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS, which has embraced a more flexible hybrid work model. That contrast further underscores the significance of adaptability and responsiveness to employee preferences in today's rapidly changing work environment. UBS has demonstrated a willingness to adapt and innovate, adopting remote and hybrid work arrangements to meet the diverse needs of its employees. This approach has allowed UBS to maintain a competitive edge and retain top talent.

In the end, work arrangements explain a part, but not the whole, of the collapse of both banks. We need to be realistic in acknowledging how work arrangements have an impact on performance and operations, but are never the whole story. Still, they are an important part of the story that deserves to be told.

Conclusion

The collapse of Credit Suisse serves as a stark reminder of the importance of adaptability and responsiveness in today's business world. By embracing hybrid work and prioritizing employee well-being, organizations can avoid the pitfalls of stagnant culture and position themselves for success in the ever-changing landscape of work. Failure to adapt may not only lead to the loss of top talent and decreased productivity but can also result in more severe consequences, as seen with the demise of Credit Suisse.","['Dr. Gleb Tsipursky', 'Amy Danise']",2023-03-24 00:00:00
https://nypost.com/2023/03/20/credit-suisse-bondholders-blast-insane-ubs-takeover/,Credit Suisse bondholders blast ‘insane’ UBS takeover: ‘Against the law’,"Investors who purchased $17 billion worth of Credit Suisse bonds were outraged after Swiss regulators approved a $3.2 billion rescue by rival UBS that left them holding the bag.

Holders of so-called “AT1,” or additional tier 1 bonds, purchased through Credit Suisse were shocked to learn that their investments were wiped out in the deal — a move that some claimed is illegal.

“In my eyes, this is against the law,” Patrik Kauffman, a fund manager at Aquila Asset Management, a firm that invests in AT1 bonds, told the Financial Times.

The “shotgun wedding” sale of the 166-year-old Credit Suisse to its historic arch-enemy is the latest shock to the global financial system — with analysts wondering whether more European banks were due to fall.

Shares of UBS rebounded in European markets on Monday afternoon, reversing an earlier slide. UBS stock was up some 2% in Zurich while Credit Suisse shares cratered by some 60%.

As a result of the deal, UBS has seen its total assets balloon to a whopping $5 trillion.

The lender will also benefit from a special government waiver allowing it to keep Credit Suisse’s profitable unit that was purchased at a discount.

UBS also managed to secure billions of dollars worth of guarantees from the Swiss government aimed at covering losses.

AT1 bonds, which are also known as “contingent convertibles,” are bonds that were created after the 2008 financial crisis.

These debt instruments, which count toward banks’ regulatory capital, are considered riskier.

While they typically provide a higher yield than most other bonds, they can also be either converted into equity or written down entirely if a lender goes under.

Kauffman described the writedown as “insane,” telling FT: “We’ve never seen this before. I don’t think this would be allowed to happen again.”

The takeover by UBS, which was pushed by Swiss authorities who were looking to shore up confidence in the shaky global banking system in the wake of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank of New York, also resulted in a loss for Credit Suisse shareholders.

Equity holders of Credit Suisse will receive 0.76 Swiss francs — or 82 cents — per share — which is well below the bank’s closing price of around $2 per share.

But the AT1 bloodbath had bondholders seeing red.

“Everyone knows that when you’re buying AT1 bonds, you’re taking risk and you’re there to absorb losses,” Jérôme Legras of Axiom Alternative Investments told FT.

“But show me the losses — there’s still 45 billion Swiss francs ($48.62 billion) of equity in the bank,” he said.

“Shareholders got 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion) and AT1 holders got nothing, which is a reversal of the usual hierarchy.”

The $17 billion wipeout is the largest loss in the $275 billion AT1 debt market to date.

Bid prices on AT1 bonds from banks including Deutsche Bank, HSBC, UBS and BNP Paribas dropped 9 to 12 points on Monday, sending yields sharply higher, data from Tradeweb showed.

At Credit Suisse itself, dollar AT1 bonds were bid as low as 1 cent on the dollar, Tradeweb pricing showed, as investors braced for the wipeout.

Key Takeaways

The Swiss government has arranged a corporate buy out of Credit Suisse, by their biggest rival UBS

The sale price will be just $3.25 billion, despite Credit Suisse having a market cap of $8.6 billion in Friday

It’s the latest in a string of banking failures and takeovers, following the closure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank

First it was Silicon Valley Bank, then Signature Bank and now Credit Suisse has ceased trading as well. The story with Credit Suisse is a little different, as it’s not been shut down by the regulator. Instead, it was bought out at a fire sale price by UBS, in a deal orchestrated by the Swiss National Bank.

This came off the back of a massive crash in the stock price, which saw it fall 67.78% over the last month.

If you think that all sounds a bit hush, hush secret handshake, that’s because in some ways it is. Credit Suisse problems have existed for a long time, and this deal means the widely lauded Swiss banking system can maintain its credibility in the global financial system.

Silicon Valley and Signature Banks were both relative upstarts in the banking industry, tailored towards the volatile startup and crypto sectors. But Credit Suisse is the textbook definition of a premium Swiss bank.

They’ve been around for 166 years and cater to some of the wealthiest individuals and biggest companies in the world. So what went wrong, and does this mean that investors in other banks need to be worried?

The Credit Suisse takeover

Credit Suisse has been no stranger to crisis. Really, they’ve been in the middle of it for the past three years at least, and investors have put up with terrible stock performance for far longer than that.

Since the market peak just prior to the 2008 global financial crisis, Credit Suisse stock lost 99.11% of its value. Other than a rally of around 6 months in 2009, that has been a consistent down trend over the past 15 years.

As part of their problems, they’ve received funding injections from their investors, the biggest of which was the Saudi National Bank. The current issues kicked off when SNB stated that they wouldn’t be providing any additional funding, with the Swiss National Bank then stepping in to provide an emergency loan of $54 billion.

For a bank the size of Credit Suisse this was only ever going to be a temporary measure, and it’s obvious that a deal has been in the works behind the scenes. Credit Suisse is one of just 30 global banks considered ‘systemically important,’ or in other words, ‘too big to fail.’

For the security of the global banking system and the reputation of Switzerland as a global banking center, the Swiss banking regulators decided that the best way forward was to amalgamate Credit Suisse with their biggest rival UBS.

To be clear, on the surface this buyout is a very bad deal for Credit Suisse shareholders.

It’s not quite at the level of the £1 that HSBC paid to purchase Silicon Valley Bank UK, but the purchase price of $3.25 billion on Sunday is a significant discount to the last trading market cap of $8.6 billion on Friday. That figure itself was down 86% from February 2021.

Not only that, but rushing the deal through means that the Swiss government will need to change the law to allow it to happen without a vote being put to shareholders.

As part of the deal, the Swiss National Bank will also be providing an additional $100 billion in liquidity available to UBS should they need to access it.

As you can see, this deal is highly unusual, but regulators believed that it was necessary to avoid the potential for another bank run, with the negative press for Credit Suisse specifically and the banking sector more broadly, causing large outflows of deposits every day.

Why has Credit Suisse stock performed so badly?

There’s been a long history of scandal and mismanagement within the Swiss banking giant. Back in 2014 Credit Suisse was fined $2.6 billion by the New York financial regulator and the US government, after it came to light that they had been assisting US clients in tax evasion.

Another $100m+ fine came from the Italian regulators in 2016 for the same thing, and a further $16.5 million from the U.S. the year after from failures in their anti-money laundering process.

Corruption charges were levied in 2018 by the US government in relation to ‘jobs for business’ arrangements with Chinese officials, resulting in a fine of $47 million.

They’ve also come under numerous counts of corporate espionage between 2016 and 2019, causing chief executive Tidjane Thiam to resign back in 2020.

Also in 2020, Swiss regulators opened a case against Credit Suisse, alleging that between 2004 and 2008 they had laundered up to $146 million for Bulgarian drug traffickers.

In 2021, Credit Suisse lost $5.5 billion on the collapsed Archegos hedge fund, a further $10 billion after the collapse of Greensill capital and was fined $427 million for their role in the “tuna bonds” scandal, pleading guilty to wire fraud.

Yeh, when you lay it out like that, it kind of makes sense why the stock hasn’t been performing too well.

Is the Credit Suisse failure linked to Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank?

Yes and no. From a fundamental standpoint, there’s no comparison between the two. As you can see banks on both sides of the Pacific have their fair share of problems, but Credit Suisse problems haven’t come directly as a result of the US banking failures.

With that said, banks all over the world are more sensitive to a bank run right now, as they’re all facing the same duration risk issues that SVB VB suffered from.

Really though, it’s not this that brought down Credit Suisse, but rather the nervousness over the banking sector in general. With confidence in banks at a low point, consumers were pulling money out of Credit Suisse at an alarming rate.

This potentially wouldn’t have been quite so dramatic, if global news hadn’t been dominated by bank failures for the week prior.

The outlook for the banking sector

We’re seeing consolidation going on, with a number of smaller banks now failing our receiving cut price buyout offers. While this might make investors and customers nervous, banks are significantly better capitalized than they were prior to 2008.

While there is never a guarantee that a financial crisis won’t happen, most analysts agree that the banking system is secure from a fundamental standpoint.

But that doesn’t mean it will always be like that. At some point in the future there will almost certainly be another financial crisis, which is why investors should ensure they always remain well diversified.

The bottom line

This diversification doesn’t just mean investing in a few different banks. We’ve seen how badly an investment can turn out for a specific company, but whole sectors can come under fire at times too.

2008 is a great example of how the entire financial sector underwent huge levels of volatility with major investors losses, and 2022 saw the same thing happen in tech.

To get proper diversification, investors need to spread their cash across different companies, different industries and even different countries.

https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-how-did-it-get-crisis-point-2023-03-16/,What happened at Credit Suisse and how did it reach crisis point?,"













March 18 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S) Chief Financial Officer Dixit Joshi and his team will hold meetings over the weekend to assess strategic scenarios for the embattled Swiss bank as it enters a make-or-break weekend.

Credit Suisse was thrown a $54 billion lifeline by the Swiss central bank on Thursday to shore up liquidity after a slump in its shares and bonds intensified fears about a global banking crisis. Though analysts said they think that might not be enough.

WHAT EVENTS LED TO THE RECENT SHARE SLUMP?

A string of scandals over many years, top management changes, multi-billion dollar losses and an uninspiring strategy can be blamed for the mess that the 167-year-old Swiss lender now finds itself in.

The sell-off in Credit Suisse's shares began in 2021, triggered by losses associated with the collapse of investment fund Archegos and Greensill Capital.

In January 2022, Antonio Horta-Osorio resigned as chairman for breaching COVID-19 rules, just eight months after he was hired to fix the ailing bank.

In July, new CEO and restructuring expert Ulrich Koerner unveiled a strategic review - but failed to win over investors. An unsubstantiated rumour on an impending failure of the bank in the autumn sent customers fleeing.

Credit Suisse confirmed in February that clients had pulled 110 billion Swiss francs ($119 billion) of funds in the fourth quarter while the bank suffered its biggest annual loss of 7.29 billion Swiss francs since the financial crisis. In December, Credit Suisse had tapped investors for 4 billion Swiss francs.

On Wednesday, Saudi National Bank (1180.SE), the bank's top backer, told reporters it could not give more money to the bank as it was constrained by regulatory hurdles, while saying it was happy with the bank's turnaround plan.

Credit Suisse shares have lost more than 75% of their value over the past twelve months.

WHAT STEPS CAN CREDIT SUISSE TAKE TO CALM INVESTORS?

Credit Suisse has said it would borrow up to $54 billion to shore up liquidity and investor confidence but some analysts believe that is unlikely to be enough to soothe investors.

Winning the backing of strategic investors could be one option to shore up market confidence. It counts Qatar Investment Authority and Saudi conglomerate Oyalan Group among its investors.

In the early days of the global financial crisis in 2008, UBS took on Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC as an investor but the stake sell-down ultimately resulted in a loss for GIC, a cautionary tale for potential backers.

Divesting stakes in various assets is an option as Credit Suisse owns an asset management business and a stake in SIX Group, which runs the Zurich stock exchange.

The bank has pivoted to a strategy of catering to rich clients while cutting back on its volatile investment banking business and has already announced plans to spin it off.

Swiss regulators are encouraging UBS and Credit Suisse to merge, one source with knowledge of the matter said, but added that neither bank wanted to do so.

HOW IMPORTANT IS CREDIT SUISSE?

The bank ranks among the world's largest wealth managers and crucially it is one of 30 global systemically important banks, whose failure would cause ripples through the entire financial system.

Credit Suisse has a local Swiss bank, wealth management, investment banking and asset management operations. It has just over 50,000 employees and 1.3 trillion Swiss francs in assets under management at the end of 2022, down from 1.6 trillion a year earlier.

With more than 150 offices in around 50 countries, Credit Suisse is the private bank for a large number of entrepreneurs, rich and ultra rich individuals and companies.

The Swiss government reportedly urged UBS to buy Credit Suisse, to end the crisis of confidence around its rival.

It's a scenario that was unthinkable a few years ago: Credit Suisse selling out to its arch-enemy and compatriot UBS.

But it is now the most plausible scenario to avoid the bankruptcy of the former European banking flagship.

The Swiss government has urged UBS to acquire Credit Suisse (CSGKF) , in an attempt to end the crisis of confidence around the bank, which has been rocked by numerous scandals over the past few years. The government, which provided Credit Suisse a 50 billion Swiss Franc loan (almost $54 billion) to shore up its liquidity this week, is not in a position to intervene further, fearing public backlash in using taxpayer money to bail out the bank.

According to Bloomberg News, the two banks are in talks with the goal of announcing an agreement by the end of the weekend. UBS could buy units of Credit Suisse, including Asset Management and Wealth Management, but investment banking would be sold to other investors or wound down.

The hardest part remains retail banking, which is the division serving Swiss consumers. This unit is the only one to have been profitable last year. If UBS gets its hands on it, there is a big risk that it would create a monopoly, which means that the deal could be blocked by the antitrust authorities. UBS and Credit Suisse are the two largest Swiss universal banks.

Retail Bank Might Be a Headache

The deal may also come up against the fact that UBS is asking the Swiss government for a backstop. In other words, UBS is asking the Swiss National Bank (SNB), Switzerland's central bank, to provide liquidity in the event that there are problems related to the activities it is buying.

Credit Suisse declined to comment. UBS didn't respond to a request for comment.

The takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS would be the sad end of a bank that was once a juggernaut. It had succeeded in weathering the 2008 financial crisis without losing too many feathers. At the time of that crisis, Credit Suisse shares had certainly fallen, but they were down only to the level of $45, which seemed to be a feat for a bank at the time.

Now Credit Suisse shares trade at $2.01.

It is the result of the repeated scandals, in particular in its investment bank division. These scandals eventually overwhelmed the bank to the point of causing it to lose the confidence of investors.

Credit Suisse is a universal bank, which offers traditional services and products to consumers, mainly in Switzerland. But the establishment is known globally for its investment banking activities - trading, mergers and acquisitions, issuance and underwriting of securities, etc. - and wealth management operations.

Two scandals occurred almost one after the other in 2021, and caused losses of several billion dollars for the bank.

The first was the bankruptcy of Greensill. Founded in 2011, the British company was a supply chain and accounts receivables lender, that specialized in lending money to companies so that they could pay their suppliers. It then packaged the debts of these companies into financial securities which it would resell to investors.

The house of cards began to crumble when these investors, including Credit Suisse, had doubts about the real value of the debts and abandoned Greensill, which then filed for bankruptcy in March 2021.

Credit Suisse had invested $10 billion of its clients' funds in Greensill products.

'Status Quo Is No Longer an Option'

The second scandal in the spring of 2021 involved family office Archegos Capital Management. Bill Hwang is a South Korean investor based in New York. Tiger Asia, a company he funded in the 2000s, suffered a major setback in 2012, because of insider trading allegations. Hwang gradually revived Tiger Asia which became Archegos.

While his company would manage $10 billion, Hwang convinced banks, including Credit Suisse, to lend him $30 billion to invest more. In 2020, he invested heavily in ViacomCBS (VIACA) - Get Free Report, which saw the value of its shares soar.

At the beginning of 2021, Credit Suisse asked Archegos to deposit funds. Hwang promised to reduce the risks. But in March 2021, ViacomCBS shares crashed and the banks asked Archegos to cover the losses, which it was no longer able to do. As a result, Hwang's company went bankrupt.

To try to revive itself and survive, Credit Suisse announced an emergency plan last October, which included drastic cost reductions, but investors do not seem to believe in the bank's turnaround.

JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein was the first to raise the possibility of a marriage between UBS and Credit Suisse on Mar. 16, when the latter aroused fears among investors worried about the problems of US regional banks after the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley. Bank, a bank at the heart of the startup and small business ecosystem.

""The issue at hand is the lack of confidence from investors,"" Abouhossein wrote in a note.

Credit Suisse's current situation is ""about ongoing market confidence issues with its IB strategy and ongoing franchise erosion,” he said. ""Status quo is no longer an option.”",[],

Credit Suisse is undergoing a massive strategic overhaul aimed at restoring stability and profitability after a litany of losses and scandals, but markets and stakeholders still appear unconvinced. Shares fell again on Friday to register their worst weekly decline since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, failing to hold on to Thursday's gains which followed an announcement that Credit Suisse would access a loan of up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the central bank. Possible UBS sale There has long been chatter that parts — or all — of Credit Suisse could be acquired by domestic rival UBS, which boasts a market cap of around $60 billion to its struggling compatriot's $7 billion. Beat Wittmann, chairman and partner at Swiss advisory firm Porta Advisors, said he expects a merger to be announced before market open Monday. ""If negotiations this weekend won't be successful then expect that CS will be under non stop fire from a falling equity price, soaring credit default swaps prices, bank counterparties cutting lines, client assets' outflows and international regulators in New York, London and Frankfurt,"" he warned. ""Key elements of a straightforward corporate financial transaction have to be to unwind and/or sell crucial parts of the investment bank and secure continuation of the Swiss bank's business,"" Wittmann added. JPMorgan's Kian Abouhossein described a takeover ""as the more likely scenario, especially by UBS."" In a note Thursday, he said a sale to UBS would likely lead to: The IPO or spinoff of Credit Suisse's Swiss bank to avoid ""too much concentration risk and market share control in the Swiss domestic market""; the closure of its investment bank; and retention of its wealth management and asset management divisions. Both banks are reportedly opposed to the idea of a forced tie-up.

BlackRock, meanwhile, denied an FT report Saturday that it is preparing a takeover bid for Credit Suisse. ""BlackRock is not participating in any plans to acquire all or any part of Credit Suisse, and has no interest in doing so,"" a company spokesperson told CNBC Saturday morning. Vincent Kaufmann, CEO of Ethos, a foundation that represents shareholders holding more than 3% of Credit Suisse stock, told CNBC that its preference was ""still to have a spin-off and independent listing of the Swiss division of CS."" ""A merger would pose a very high systemic risk for Switzerland and also create a dangerous Monopoly for the Swiss citizens,"" he added. Bank of America strategists noted on Thursday, meanwhile, that Swiss authorities may prefer consolidation between Credit Suisse's flagship domestic bank and a smaller regional partner, since any combination with UBS could create ""too large a bank for the country."" 'Orderly resolution' needed The pressure is on for the bank to reach an ""orderly"" solution to the crisis, be that a sale to UBS or another option. Barry Norris, CEO of Argonaut Capital, which has a short position in Credit Suisse, stressed the importance of a smooth outcome. ""I think in Europe, the battleground is Credit Suisse, but if Credit Suisse has to unwind its balance sheet in a disorderly way, those problems are going to spread to other financial institutions in Europe and also beyond the banking sector, particularly I think into commercial property and private equity, which also look to me to be vulnerable to what's going on in financial markets at the moment,"" Norris told ""Squawk Box Europe"" Friday.

The importance of an ""orderly resolution"" was echoed by Andrew Kenningham, chief European economist at Capital Economics. ""As a Global Systemically Important Bank (or GSIB) it will have a resolution plan but these plans (or 'living wills') have not been put to the test since they were introduced during the Global Financial Crisis,"" Kenningham said. ""Experience suggests that a quick resolution can be achieved without triggering too much contagion provided that the authorities act decisively and senior debtors are protected."" He added that while regulators are aware of this, as evidenced by the SNB and Swiss regulator FINMA stepping in on Wednesday, the risk of a ""botched resolution"" will worry markets until a long-term solution to the bank's problems becomes clear.

Stock to zero?

Despite a possible UBS acquisition, Norris still expects Credit Suisse's stock to become worthless. ""Our view has been that the end game has always been UBS stepping in and rescuing Credit Suisse with the encouragement of the Swiss government/National Bank,"" Norris told CNBC Pro Saturday. ""If this happens we would expect [Credit Suisse] equity holders to get zero, deposit holders guaranteed and probably but not certain that bond holders will be made whole."" European banking shares have suffered steep declines throughout the latest Credit Suisse saga, highlighting market concerns about the contagion effect given the sheer scale of the 167-year-old institution. The sector was rocked at the beginning of the week by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the largest banking failure since Lehman Brothers, along with the shuttering of New York-based Signature Bank. Yet in terms of scale and potential impact on the global economy, these companies pale in comparison to Credit Suisse, whose balance sheet is around twice the size of Lehman Brothers when it collapsed, at around 530 billion Swiss francs as of end-2022. It is also far more globally inter-connected, with multiple international subsidiaries.

For Wittmann, the demise of Credit Suisse has been ""entirely self-inflicted by years of mismanagement and an epic destruction of corporate and shareholder value."" ""Broader lessons learnt will have to include minimization of investment banking, higher capital requirements, securing alignment of interest re compensation and importantly that the structurally under-resourced Swiss regulator FINMA would be brought up to fulfill its task,"" he said. Central banks to provide liquidity The biggest question economists and traders are wrestling with is whether Credit Suisse's situation poses a systemic risk to the global banking system. Oxford Economics said in a note Friday that it was not incorporating a financial crisis into its baseline scenario, since that would require systemic problematic credit or liquidity issues. At the moment, the forecaster sees the problems at Credit Suisse and SVB as ""a collection of different idiosyncratic issues."" ""The only generalised problem that we can infer at this stage is that banks – who have all been required to hold large amounts of sovereign debt against their flighty deposits – may be sitting on unrealised losses on those high-quality bonds as yields have risen,"" said Lead Economist Adam Slater. ""We know that for most banks, including Credit Suisse, that exposure to higher yields has largely been hedged. Therefore, it is difficult to see a systemic problem unless driven by some other factor of which we are not yet aware.""

https://www.finews.com/news/english-news/56818-sweeping-up-shambles-from-credit-suisse-debacle,Sweeping up the Shambles From the Credit Suisse Debacle,"With outrage over the Credit Suisse debacle unleashed during an extraordinary session of the Swiss parliament, the Swiss financial industry is left to pick up and mend the broken shards. This will require a sober assessment grounded in reality in the view of finews.com.

The extraordinary session of the Swiss parliament called after the government-forced UBS takeover of Credit Suisse did not cast Switzerland in a good light. Political parties gave the Federal Council a resounding slap by rejecting the emergency aid package for the bank merger, damaging confidence in political institutions. Politicians preferred posturing ahead of upcoming elections rather than dedicating themselves to fulfilling their duties which previously have been praised for stability and legal certainty.

A seemingly nonchalant rubber stamping of the decree to fully write off Credit Suisse's subordinated AT1 bonds to the tune of 16 billion francs ($17 billion), provoked outrage not only in Switzerland but around the globe.

Becoming a Banana Republic?

Judgment from abroad was harsh and prompt, with commentators calling Switzerland a financial banana republic without apparent irony.

So long as negative headlines remain limited to brief episodes, the reputational damage to the Swiss financial industry will likely be limited. However, if the clamor of critical voices doesn't subside shortly, the long-held view of Switzerland as a much-vaunted haven of stability is likely to suffer permanent damage.

Close Scrutiny From Abroad

The country's reputation as a reliable financial center could suffer if the rule of law is watered down after the extraordinary session. There is currently an ongoing and self-destructive discussion about Swiss neutrality and how to deal with frozen assets of Russian origin which could become a sensitive issue. It would be a bold and unprecedented move for Switzerland to expropriate blocked assets and earmark them for war reparations for Ukraine's reconstruction.

Another test will come when a parliamentary commission of inquiry (PUK) is established this year, which would start this summer at the earliest. Despite all the justified demands for a thorough investigation into the role of the various players in the Credit Suisse debacle, a PUK must not lead to a politicized solution.

Taming a Monster

In addition to politics of symbolism instead of substance, politicians made it clear during the extraordinary session that the combined UBS results in a large bank with a de facto state guarantee, which is more of a burden than a relief for the financial industry over the long term.

Concerns were directed primarily at the Swiss banking industry. Accusations were raised from many sides that the combined UBS would dominate the market and elevate itself to a dominant position.

Competition Commission's Key Role

Limiting outsized influence and influencing what the bank will look like is a task for the Competition Commission (Weko). The authority has strong sanctioning powers, ranging from a heavy fine on UBS to the spinning off of entire divisions.

Even so, Weko is not the one with the final say, but the Federal Council. Under Article 11 of the Cartel Act, it can approve mergers previously prohibited by Weko at its discretion. Because of this structure, political pressure on the Federal Council is likely to increase among those wanting to see a spin-off of Credit Suisse's Swiss unit on the pretext of it being in the interest of a robust financial industry.

A Delicate Balance

As a further measure to tame an overpowering UBS monster, parliament debated higher capital adequacy requirements. An increase in ratios doesn't come at zero cost, and will inevitably burden the banking industry and lead to spillover effects.

If banks had to set aside more equity capital for granting mortgage loans, this would severely affect Switzerland as a country with a very high level of mortgage debt by international standards. In a worst-case scenario, that could trigger a real estate crisis. Adding to the burden is the international competitiveness of the banking industry suffering if Switzerland went it alone.

Failure Cannot be Prevented

No matter how hard the screws are tightened, and with the strictest capital ratios in the world, no bank is safe from going bust as Credit Suisse's demise vividly demonstrated. It collapsed not because of insufficient capital, but because confidence in the strategy developed by the board of directors and in the operational skills of management was lost.

The bitter truth for a market economy is that a failure is an option and sometimes a necessary outcome for thriving innovation and prosperity.

Sweeping Denunciations

In addition to the regulation debate, the special session was characterized by populist undertones, with malice at times being heaped on an entire profession. Sweeping attacks are likely to have unjustly hurt at least some of the many thousands of Credit Suisse and UBS employees.

Until proven otherwise, conscientious employees in the trenches like requirements engineers specializing in asset management applications and regulatory business analysts, do not have to answer for the entire debacle.

Still, they are put in the barrel with the bad apples and now too must endure ridicule. One might be tempted to think the profession as a whole can emerge humbled from these trying times and realize that serious bankers should not be above society but amidst it. As some are incapable of self-reflection, it remains to be seen if this transpires.

Reaping the Whirlwind

Bank managers who collected huge bonuses despite misconduct were rightly castigated. Bank boards failing to recognize the signs after the government bailout of UBS in 2008, and sticking to a toxic bonus culture further sowed the seeds of discontent. They are now reaping a whirlwind as anger and resentment grow.

Now that the mismanaged Credit Suisse had to be rescued with state tax guarantees, even politicians previously supportive of banks can no longer tolerate this self-serving mentality with a clear conscience. After myriad management failures of banks politicians must now ensure, by capping bonuses for one, that false incentives are eliminated and losses are also borne by managers.

Avoid Quick Fixes

Despite all the criticism in recent days, whether justified or not, politicians should keep their cool and beware of scattershot legislation resulting in a «Lex UBS». Otherwise, in addition to the loss of a second major bank, the Swiss financial center, which is particularly characterized by system stability, will be relegated from the top league.",[],2023-04-17 05:00:55

https://www.finews.com/news/english-news/56817-ubs-cs-first-quarter-singapore-ib-ib-fees-market-share,Credit Suisse is Going Out with a Bang in Singapore,"In a bittersweet swan song, the near-extinct major Swiss bank puts in a strong showing in investment banking in the first quarter, clearly outdoing UBS, its soon-to-be acquirer. finews.asia takes a closer look.

We likely have at least another two quarters to go until UBS’s acquisition of Credit Suisse is consummated. Until that time, Switzerland’s second-largest bank remains a separate entity.

That makes the rest of 2023 the as-if-nothing-ever-happened year. In the background, employees face innumerable and unfamiliar meetings, usually scheduled at short notice. Then comes the constant roller coaster of emotional ups and downs after each new wayward, public comment by someone ostensibly in the know.

Still, the bank itself is likely to continue to putter along, almost unthinkingly, with a few raised eyebrows and maybe an instruction or intervention from the new owners to its current management and board, who have in the meantime been reduced to little more than pro forma caretakers.

Outdoing UBS

As the nostalgia industry kicks into high gear, something finews.asia previously commented on, it is an ideal time to document what could have been for Switzerland’s second-largest bank while also speculating on the rough business profile of the new combined entity from 2024 on.

One area that Credit Suisse clearly outdid its parent-to-be was the Singapore investment banking market in the first quarter.

According to recent data from Refinitiv, it jumped to fifth in investment bank fees in the city-state, up from 18tha year earlier by raking in just over $11 million in fees, which was almost triple the level a year earlier (corresponding to a 294 percent gain). UBS, for its part, did not even make the list of the top ten.

Few Deals

In M&A, Credit Suisse placed third, up from seventh a year earlier, although this gain was had against an overall market that was down by well more than half. That fact was reflected in the value of the one transaction it advised on, prompting the value of the deal volume it advised on to fall 93 percent to $358 million.

UBS was shunted to sixth from fifth in the same period, also based on one deal worth $123 million.

Importantly, neither Swiss bank made the top ten in the equity and equity-related league tables, and they both dropped out of the city-state domiciled bond ranks when compared with the fourth quarter, as finews.asia previously reported.

Weakness in Bonds

That potentially suggests that the two banks have some work to do when it comes to fixed income from 2024 on, which has traditionally been a perennial Swiss weakness when compared with other significantly sized global institutions with strong private banking or wealth management franchises.

With fixed income again in vogue with investors after years of little to no interest rates and quantitative easing, that isn’t a particularly good look.

It potentially puts their ultimate product shelf selection and distribution at a long-term competitive disadvantage, particularly when compared with banks teeming with plentiful numbers of core affluent individual clients who are more than likely apt to take up each new issue out there, giving them a strong backbone to rely on.

As an example, HSBC ranked as the pre-eminent debt capital market book-runner in Singapore in the first quarter, followed by Societe Generale, Barclays, JP Morgan, and DBS.

Nowhere in Loans

That weakness was also mirrored in regional syndicated loan data, which was also recently released by Refinitiv.

Neither Swiss bank made the Asia (excluding Japan) mandated arranger loan league table, while HSBC placed third (behind Bank of China and Mizuho), OCBC 4th, DBS 9th, and Standard Chartered 10th.

By itself, that is more than likely to give someone in the combined strategy team plentiful food for thought for the years ahead - if it hasn’t already.",[],2023-04-14 08:02:32
https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/21/investing/credit-suisse-banking-crisis-bear-stearns/index.html,Credit Suisse went the way of Bear Stearns in 2008. But this crisis is different,"London CNN —

On a Sunday in March 2008, the US government and bankers raced to finalize a rescue of Bear Stearns, pushed to the brink of collapse by what amounted to a run on the bank.

A fire sale to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) was agreed on March 16, 2008 for $2 a share, a 93% discount to Bear Stearns’s closing price the preceding Friday. (The price was later increased to $10 a share.)

The deal, done under the direction of the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury, marked the end of the road for one of Wall Street’s most storied firms. The 85-year-old investment bank was the first domino to fall in the financial crisis that ravaged global markets and had dire consequences for the US and European economies.

Almost exactly 15 years later, in an eerily familiar sequence of events, regulators and bankers in Switzerland scrambled over the weekend to piece together a takeover of Credit Suisse, after an emergency loan from the Swiss National Bank failed to reassure clients and investors.

The buyer was another larger rival, UBS (UBS). The price, 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion), was about 60% less than the bank was worth when markets closed two days prior. The deal was again done at the behest of regulators.

The Swiss government said Tuesday it had ordered Credit Suisse to temporarily suspend the payment of some bonuses, including share awards, to bank staff. It’s an ignominious end to Credit Suisse’s 167-year history, and the failure raises fresh questions about whether this is the start of a broader banking meltdown.

“I think the answer is no one knows. It doesn’t look great, but equally it could look a lot worse,” said Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics.

The actions of central banks and regulators have restored “a degree of stabilization” but “only time will tell” whether that will be enough to stem a wider crisis.

“If we stabilize over a couple of weeks and months, we’ll know the worst has passed,” he told CNN on Monday.

Credit Suisse is the first “global systemically important” bank to be rescued since 2008. The list, which denotes banks whose failure might trigger a worldwide financial crisis, comprises just 30 lenders, including JPMorgan, Bank of America (BAC), HSBC (HBCYF), Barclays (BCS) and Bank of China (BACHF).

Yet despite its importance to the financial system, most analysts are not expecting Credit Suisse’s demise to mark the beginning of another global financial crisis.

The greater risk, they say, is that tension in the financial system causes banks to restrict lending. A credit crunch would weigh on households and businesses, raising the risk of recession. That could lead to an increase in bad debts and losses for lenders, which their current capital cushions might not be big enough to absorb.

“There’s no question that the banking system in aggregate is in a better position now than 15 years ago,” Goltermann continued. “We have a better buffer, but is it going to be enough?”

Central bank firepower

Banks in the United States and Europe are in much better financial shape than they were in 2008. Significant regulatory reforms since the crisis mean that bank balance sheets have been strengthened and exposure to risky loans significantly reduced.

“It’s not to say there won’t be more small banks that fall over… But it’s not an ‘across the board’ situation like we had in 2008 because the oversight is a lot stronger,” said Annelise Peers, the chief investment officer at Investec Bank Switzerland.

Not only is there less anxiety about the stability of banks, but there is also greater confidence in the powers of regulators to contain a broader crisis.

Based on the experience gained from previous crises, including the coronavirus pandemic, central banks have developed a number of tools to provide financing to markets quickly if needed.

On Sunday, the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Japan and Switzerland agreed to make an emergency supply of dollars available until at least the end of April to prevent liquidity from drying up.

This coordinated action indicates how seriously they are taking the risk of broader contagion.

In a sign of the relative health of their balance sheets, European banks showed limited appetite Monday for the emergency facility.

While many smaller US banks have tapped a new Fed lending program, established after Silicon Valley Bank collapsed on March 10, none have borrowed on terms that suggest they are on the brink of failure.

Confidence is crucial

But capital and regulation are not enough. Banks also depend on customers’ and investors’ perceptions of them. Credit Suisse’s healthy capital and liquidity ratios did not save it once confidence evaporated.

Central banks and governments would struggle to calm markets in the face of a broader collapse in confidence that causes more bank runs of the kind that claimed Credit Suisse, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. That’s why regulators are acting so forcefully to boost trust in banks.

“Banking is all about trust; that can evaporate at any time and I think that is [creating] the big nerves,” said Rupert Silver, director of fixed income at Credo Group, a UK-based wealth manager.

There is “notably more risk” among US regional banks, which are subject to lighter regulation than large lenders, he added. “I’m much less worried about Europe and the UK… the banks are dramatically well-capitalized [and] the vast majority are making more money than they have ever made before.”

Shares of First Republic (FRC), a regional US bank, closed 47% lower Monday even as stock markets posted gains on investor optimism that regulators have contained the worst of the crisis.

Beware the credit crunch

Troubles at First Republic and other regional US banks serve as a cautionary reminder that a sharp increase in interest rates since last year also poses a risk to banks other than SVB.

“While it’s tempting to dismiss the problems at SVB, Signature Bank and Credit Suisse as idiosyncratic, they have revealed that problems are lurking in the financial system as interest rates rise,” said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics.

“Key areas to monitor include smaller European banks and shadow banks,” Shearing added.

“Shadow banks,” or non-bank financial institutions, refer to specialized lenders that fall outside the traditional banking sector. These can include mortgage and vehicle finance companies, as well as some hedge funds, private credit funds and money market funds.

On the one hand, the run-up in interest rates has made lending more lucrative for banks, helping to raise aggregate EU banking sector profitability to its highest level since 2014.

But on the other hand, higher rates have hit the value of some of banks’ assets, including government bonds. Meanwhile, weaker economic growth and rising borrowing costs are making it harder for their customers to repay loans.

The risk is that banks, which have already tightened credit and increased provisions for bad debt, adopt an even more cautious approach to lending in response to recent market turmoil. That would crimp consumer demand and business investment and could trigger an economic downturn.

“If banks are under stress, they might be reluctant to lend,” US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last week in testimony to the Senate Finance Committee. “We could see credit become more expensive and less available.”

In remarks to be delivered later on Tuesday, she will also say the US federal government may have to come to the rescue of uninsured bank depositors once again if smaller lenders suffer bank runs like the one that felled SVB.

Shearing sees a greater danger. “It’s possible that a vicious circle develops, in which credit tightens, the real economy deteriorates, and default rates start to rise,” he said. That would be an “altogether more serious crisis.”

https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/19/business/credit-suisse-ubs-rescue/index.html,UBS is buying Credit Suisse in bid to halt banking crisis,"London CNN —

Switzerland’s biggest bank, UBS, has agreed to buy its ailing rival Credit Suisse in an emergency rescue deal aimed at stemming financial market panic unleashed by the failure of two American banks earlier this month.

“UBS today announced the takeover of Credit Suisse,” the Swiss National Bank said in a statement Sunday. It said the rescue would “secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy.”

UBS is paying 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion) for Credit Suisse, about 60% less than the bank was worth when markets closed on Friday. Credit Suisse shareholders will be largely wiped out, receiving the equivalent of just 0.76 Swiss francs in UBS shares for stock that was worth 1.86 Swiss francs on Friday. Owners of $17 billion worth of “additional tier one” bonds — a riskier class of bank debt — will lose everything, Swiss regulators said.

Extraordinarily, the deal will not need the approval of shareholders after the Swiss government agreed to change the law to remove any uncertainty about the deal.

Credit Suisse (CS) had been losing the trust of investors and customers for years. In 2022, it recorded its worst loss since the global financial crisis. But confidence collapsed last week after it acknowledged “material weakness” in its bookkeeping and as the demise of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank spread fear about weaker institutions at a time when soaring interest rates have undermined the value of some financial assets.

Shares in the 167-year-old bank fell 25% over the week, money poured from investment funds it manages and at one point account holders were withdrawing deposits of more than $10 billion per day, the Financial Times reported. An emergency loan of nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank failed to stop the bleeding.

But it did “build a bridge” to the weekend, to allow the rescue to be pieced together, Swiss officials said Sunday night.

“This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue,” UBS chairman Colm Kelleher told reporters.

“It is absolutely essential to the financial structure of Switzerland and … to global finance,” he told reporters.

Desperate to prevent the meltdown spreading through the global financial system on Monday, Swiss authorities initiated the search for a private sector solution, with limited state support, while reportedly considering Plan B — a full or partial nationalization.

“Given recent extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances, the announced merger represents the best available outcome,” Credit Suisse chairman Axel Lehmann said in a statement.

“This has been an extremely challenging time for Credit Suisse and while the team has worked tirelessly to address many significant legacy issues and execute on its new strategy, we are forced to reach a solution today that provides a durable outcome.”

The emergency takeover was agreed to after a days of frantic negotiations involving financial regulators in Switzerland, the United States and United Kingdom. UBS (UBS) and Credit Suisse rank among the 30 most important banks in the global financial system, and together they have almost $1.7 trillion in assets.

Regulators applaud the takeover

Financial market regulators around the world cheered UBS’ action to take over Credit Suisse.

US authorities said they supported the action and worked closely with the Swiss central bank to assist the takeover.

“We welcome the announcements by the Swiss authorities today to support financial stability,” said US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a joint statement. “The capital and liquidity positions of the US. banking system are strong, and the US financial system is resilient.”

Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, said the banking sector remains resilient but the ECB stands at the ready to help banks maintain enough cash on hand to fund their operations if the need arises.

“I welcome the swift action and the decisions taken by the Swiss authorities,” Lagarde said. “They are instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.

The Bank of England said it welcomed the measures taken by the Swiss authorities “to support financial stability.”

“We have been engaging closely with international counterparts throughout the preparations for today’s announcements and will continue to support their implementation,” it said in a statement. “The UK banking system is well capitalized and funded, and remains safe and sound.”

How UBS and Credit Suisse will fit together

The global headquarters of UBS and Credit Suisse are just 300 yards apart in Zurich but the banks’ fortunes have been on very different paths recently. Shares of UBS have climbed 15% in the past two years, and it booked a profit of $7.6 billion in 2022. It had a stock market value of about $65 billion on Friday, according to Refinitiv.

Credit Suisse shares have lost 84% of their value over the same period, and last year it posted a loss of $7.9 billion. It was worth just $8 billion at the end of last week.

Dating back to 1856, Credit Suisse has its roots in the Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (SKA), which was set up to finance the expansion of the railroad network and industrialization of Switzerland.

In addition to being Switzerland’s second biggest bank, it looks after the wealth of many of the world’s richest people and offers global investment banking services. It had more than 50,000 employees at the end of 2022, 17,000 of those in Switzerland.

The Swiss National Bank said it would provide a loan of 100 billion Swiss francs ($108 billion) to UBS and Credit Suisse to boost liquidity.

UBS Chief Executive Ralph Hamers will be CEO of the combined bank, and Kelleher will serve as chairman.

The takeover will reinforce the position of UBS as the world’s leading wealth manager with $5 trillion of invested assets, and boost its ambition to grow in the Americas and Asia. UBS said it expects to generate cost savings of $8 billion per year by 2027. Credit Suisse’s investment bank is in the crosshairs.

“Let me be clear. UBS intends to downsize Credit Suisse’s investment banking business and align it with our conservative risk culture,” Kelleher said.",['Mark Thompson'],2023-03-19 00:00:00
https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/29/politics/credit-suisse-justice-department/index.html,Credit Suisse's efforts to resolve Justice Department probe complicated by bank's fall,"CNN —

Attorneys for Credit Suisse met with senior Justice Department officials Wednesday as turmoil in the banking industry throws new complications into efforts to resolve allegations that the bank continued to help wealthy clients evade taxes in violation of a years-old plea deal with the US, people briefed on the matter told CNN.

The meeting comes at a precarious time as Credit Suisse is being acquired by Switzerland’s largest bank UBS as part of an emergency rescue intended to stave off a global banking crisis. Credit Suisse’s fall now threatens to complicate ongoing discussions for a new settlement that, before the Swiss government-engineered rescue, was estimated could reach over $1 billion, people briefed on the matter said.

The Zurich-based bank agreed to pay a $2.6 billion fine and pleaded guilty in 2014 to aiding tax evasion. A Senate report published Wednesday estimated that Credit Suisse continued to hold more than $700 million in concealed accounts in violation of the 2014 plea deal, despite promising to cease doing business with clients seeking to evade taxes. The Justice Department has been investigating.

The emergency takeover has added hurdles to ongoing discussions to resolve the new Justice Department investigation, in part because some US government officials have expressed concerns that a large settlement could add fresh turmoil to the banking industry, people briefed on the matter said.

Credit Suisse has hired lawyers to conduct an internal investigation to identify accounts that could violate US law, as part of an effort to reach a new settlement with the Justice Department, the people briefed on the matter said.

Spokespeople for Credit Suisse and the Justice Department declined to comment on Wednesday’s meeting.

The turmoil also presents a predicament for Justice Department officials, who have promised a crackdown on white-collar crime and recidivist corporations that repeatedly break US law.

The two-year investigation published by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, on Wednesday criticized the Justice Department, highlighting Credit Suisse as an example of the department failing to hold corporate criminals accountable.

The report alleges that “despite internal reviews, a court appointed monitor, several whistleblower disclosures to the Justice Department, a modernization of systems and significant sums spent on outside attorney,” the bank continued to hide millions of American dollars in dozens of offshore accounts.

Those violations, the report said, breached Credit Suisse’s 2014 federal plea deal in which the bank promised to stop helping Americans hide financial assets.

Jeffrey Nieman, an attorney who represents whistleblowers and informants cited in the Senate report, said Credit Suisse’s breach of its plea deal means that the Justice Department should insist on collecting at least $1.3 billion from the bank.

“Credit Suisse’s collapse—caused by its own misconduct and mismanagement—does not operate as a get out of jail free card in the United States, where no person or entity is above the law,” said Nieman, whose clients could receive a monetary award for their role. “We remain optimistic that the Justice Department will hold Credit Suisse, a repeat offender, accountable for continuously and blatantly having defrauded the United States.”

A Credit Suisse spokesperson said the bank’s new leadership cooperated with the Senate inquiry and that the bank does not tolerate tax evasion.

“In its core, the report describes legacy issues, some from a decade ago, and we have implemented extensive enhancements since then to root out individuals who seek to conceal assets from tax authorities,” the bank spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.

In one example, according to the Senate report, a former Credit Suisse banker gave the Justice Department documents and other information in April 2014 about an offshore account that violated the terms of Credit Suisse’s plea deal, but the Justice Department didn’t act on that information until a year later. Though the owner of that account was charged with a crime, the report claims that DOJ “appears to have taken no punitive action against Credit Suisse.”

For the next several years, the former Credit Suisse banker continued to hand over information about the bank’s practices, the report says, but “DOJ still took no action.”

“Now, nine years after Credit Suisse’s plea agreement, the bank continues to identify potential undeclared accounts, and DOJ has yet to impose additional penalties,” the report states. “This fact indicates a lapse in oversight by DOJ and a failure to evaluate the [account in 2014] as a potential systemic failure in Credit Suisse’s oversight and review process.”

“DOJ must correct its lax oversight of Credit Suisse, rigorously scrutinize the bank’s compliance with its 2014 plea agreement, and hold Credit Suisse accountable for any violations of its plea agreement,” the report said.

The report also found that several other Swiss banks could be repeatedly violating similar agreements with DOJ. According to the report, more than 80 Swiss banks have entered into agreements with DOJ over helping wealthy individuals hide money in accounts around the world to avoid paying taxes.","['Evan Perez Hannah Rabinowitz', 'Evan Perez', 'Hannah Rabinowitz']",2023-03-29 00:00:00

Show Caption Hide Caption Swiss bank UBS takes over ailing Credit Suisse Banking giant UBS is buying its smaller rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion, in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in global banking. AP

Banking giant UBS is buying its smaller rival Credit Suisse for $3.2 billion in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in global banking, Swiss President Alain Berset announced on Sunday night.

Berset called the announcement ""one of great breadth for the stability of international finance. An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.""

The Swiss Federal Council, a seven-member governing body that includes Berset, said in a press release Sunday that it was providing a guarantee of liquidity from the Swiss National Bank to Credit Suisse.

""The Federal Council is taking this measure in order to protect financial stability and the Swiss economy,"" it the council// said.

The Swiss government said it would provide more than $9 billion ""in order to reduce any risks for UBS"" and ""potential losses arising from certain assets that UBS takes over as part of the transaction.""

Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world's globally systemic important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

SVB: Close to 190 banks could face Silicon Valley Bank's fate, according to a new study

'Wake-up call': Advocacy groups, lawmakers highlight law they say led to SVB collapse

Sunday's news conference follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further bank panics. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse's share price began plummeting this week.

Berset said the council had agreed to guarantee a total of 150 billion francs ($162 billion) of liquidity to Credit Suisse, well beyond the 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) figure that had been announced publicly. But that didn’t appear to be enough.

“We noted that the outflows of liquidity and the volatility of the markets demonstrated that necessary confidence could no longer be restored, and a rapid solution guaranteeing stability was essential.”

Still, many of Credit Suisse's problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.

The deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn't invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.

On Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.

Its current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified ""material weaknesses"" in the bank's internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.

While smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.

Despite the banking turmoil, the European Central Bank on Thursday approved a large, half-percentage point increase in interest rates to try to curb stubbornly high inflation, saying Europe's banking sector is ""resilient,"" with strong finances.

ECB President Christine Lagarde said the banks ""are in a completely different position from 2008"" during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.

The Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank collapse. Could more banks follow? How is the government responding to the Silicon Valley Bank failure? Here's what we know. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY

https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/18/business/credit-suisse-crisis-ubs/index.html,Credit Suisse faces fateful weekend. Will UBS step up with a rescue bid?,"London CNN —

The fate of Credit Suisse could be decided in the next 24 hours after a torrid week for Switzerland’s second biggest bank.

Local media reported that the Swiss cabinet had gathered for a crisis meeting at 5 p.m. local time (12 p.m. ET) Saturday to discuss the ailing bank’s future, as reports swirled of a possible takeover by its biggest Swiss rival, UBS (UBS). A spokesperson for the Swiss finance ministry declined to comment.

Investors and customers pulled their money out of Credit Suisse over the past several days as turmoil swept the global banking industry following the collapse of two US lenders.

Shares of the bank lost 25% over the course of the week, despite an emergency $54 billion loan from the Swiss National Bank. The price of financial contracts designed to protect investors against possible losses on its bonds soared to record levels. More than $450 million was pulled from European and US funds managed by the bank between Monday and Wednesday, according to Morningstar.

The lifeline from the Swiss central bank, announced late Wednesday night after the stock had crashed to a new record low, only bought Credit Suisse (CS) some time.

Reuters and the Financial Times, citing people familiar with the matter, both reported that Swiss regulators were urging UBS to agree a rescue of Credit Suisse before markets open Monday to shore up confidence in the country’s banking system. The FT said the boards of UBS and Credit Suisse were expected to meet separately over the weekend.

Credit Suisse and UBS both declined to comment to Reuters.

BlackRock (BLK), which owns 4% of Credit Suisse, denied a separate report in the Financial Times that it was drawing up an alternative bid for all or part of the beleagured bank.

“BlackRock is not participating in any plans to acquire all or any part of Credit Suisse, and has no interest in doing so,” a BlackRock spokesperson told CNN.

Credit Suisse, which is among the 30 most important banks in the global financial system, has been on the ropes for years following a series of scandals, huge losses and strategic missteps. Its stock is down 75% over the past 12 months. But the crisis of confidence escalated rapidly this month.

The failure of Silicon Valley Bank last week, the biggest by a US lender since the global financial crisis of 2008, sent investors fleeing other players perceived as weak.

Then Credit Suisse dropped another bombshell. Publishing its annual report on Tuesday, the 167-year-old bank acknowledged “material weakness” in its financial reporting, adding it had failed to adequately identify potential risks to its financial statements.

The following day, its biggest shareholder — the Saudi National Bank — made clear it would not be pumping any more money into the bank, after spending $1.5 billion last year for a stake of almost 10%. That spooked investors.

In a note on Thursday, JPMorgan banking analysts wrote that a takeover by UBS was the most probable endgame.

UBS would likely spin off Credit Suisse’s Swiss business since the combined market share would make up about 30% of Switzerland’s domestic banking market and mean “too much concentration risk and market share control,” they added.

GENEVA (AP) — Banking giant UBS is buying troubled rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion, in a deal orchestrated by regulators in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in the global banking system.

Swiss authorities pushed for UBS to take over its smaller rival after a plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and the bank’s customers. Shares of Credit Suisse and other banks plunged last week after the failure of two banks in the U.S. sparked concerns about other potentially shaky institutions in the global financial system.

Credit Suisse is among the 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

The deal was “one of great breadth for the stability of international finance,” said Swiss President Alain Berset as he announced it Sunday night. “An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.”

Switzerland’s executive branch, a seven-member governing body that includes Berset, passed an emergency ordinance allowing the merger to go through without shareholder approval.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann called the sale “a clear turning point.”

“It is a historic, sad and very challenging day for Credit Suisse, for Switzerland and for the global financial markets,” Lehmann said, adding that the focus is now on the future and in particular on the 50,000 Credit Suisse employees, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland.

Following news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated financial moves to stabilize banks in the coming week. This includes daily access to a lending facility for banks looking to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice which was widely used during the 2008 financial crisis.

“Today is one of the most significant days in European banking since 2008, with far-reaching repercussions for the industry,” said Max Georgiou, an analyst at Third Bridge. “These events could alter the course of not only European banking but also the wealth management industry more generally.”

Colm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed the “enormous opportunities” that emerge from the takeover, and highlighted his bank’s “conservative risk culture” — a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse’s reputation for more swashbuckling, aggressive gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said the council “regrets that the bank, which was once a model institution in Switzerland and part of our strong location, was able to get into this situation at all.”

The combination of the two biggest and best-known Swiss banks, each with storied histories dating to the mid-19th century, amounts to a thunderclap for Switzerland’s reputation as a global financial center — leaving it on the cusp of having a single national champion in banking.

The deal follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further panic. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse’s share price began plummeting this week.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde lauded the “swift action” by Swiss officials, saying they were “instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.”

She said the banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.

UBS officials said they plan to sell off parts of Credit Suisse or reduce the bank’s size in the coming months and years.

The Swiss government is providing more than 100 billion francs in aid and financial backstops to make the deal go through.

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs in Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out. The securities are a special type of bonds European bank regulators use to provide banks with a capital cushion in times of distress.

Berset said the Federal Council had already been discussing a long-troubled situation at Credit Suisse since the beginning of the year and held urgent meetings in the last four days amid spiraling concerns about its financial health that caused major swoons in its stock price and raised the specter of the 2007-08 financial crisis.

Investors and banking industry analysts were still digesting the deal, but at least one analyst was sour on the news because it could damage Switzerland’s global banking image.

“A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,” said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas LLC, in an email.

Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

The Credit Suisse parent bank is not part of European Union supervision, but it has entities in several European countries that are. Lagarde reiterated what she said last week after the central bank raised interest rates — that the European banking sector is resilient, with strong financial reserves and plenty of ready cash.

Many of Credit Suisse’s problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve.

FRANKFURT, Germany -- In a bid to ease turmoil in the world financial system, Swiss authorities engineered a plan for the UBS bank to acquire its troubled smaller rival Credit Suisse at a marked-down price.

It's another urgent attempt to fight fears that have put the financial world on edge 15 years after the failure of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers pitched the global economy into a crisis.

Here are key things to know — and some things that aren't yet known — about the takeover and the wider market anxiety fueled by bank failures in the U.S.

WHY IS UBS TAKING OVER CREDIT SUISSE?

Swiss authorities pushed UBS to take over its rival after the price of Credit Suisse shares plunged and depositors fled, raising fears that it could fail.

Credit Suisse isn't just any bank. Unlike midsize Silicon Valley Bank, which went under earlier this month in the U.S., it is one of 30 banks classified as globally significant because it could pose a risk of bigger trouble if it collapses, as happened with Lehman.

Credit Suisse's troubles pre-dated Silicon Valley's failure, including a $5.5 billion loss on its dealings with private investment firm Archegos and a spying scandal.

Then fears about banks fed by the U.S. failures made investors take a closer, less friendly look at banks. When Credit Suisse's biggest investor, Saudi National Bank, refused to put up more money, investors and depositors headed for the exits.

WILL THE TAKEOVER RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM?

Confidence in banks is shaky right now. That said, economists, bank regulators and stock-market analysts generally say that banks are in better shape than in 2008, with thicker financial buffers against losses and a slew of new regulations.

And this time, policymakers have been quicker to respond. The U.S. Federal Reserve offered credit to banks that suffered uninsured losses on bond holdings due to rising interest rates.

On Sunday, just ahead of the opening of markets in Asia, other central banks joined the Fed in expanding unlimited dollar credit to any bank that needs it. That was a swift preemptive move used in earlier emergencies such as the pandemic market meltdown of 2020.

Swiss officials balked at letting Credit Suisse just fail, unlike the U.S. government in 2008, when it let Lehman go under, spreading losses and fear across the financial system. Financial institutions had been in trouble since 2007, but it wasn't until two weeks after Lehman that the U.S. Congress came to the system's aid with a $700 billion emergency economic stabilization act.

Questions have been raised about the technicalities of the Credit Suisse rescue and the decision to insure all depositors at Silicon Valley. But officials are showing that they learned one lesson from Lehman, “namely to act decisively and swiftly, and if needed to run roughshod over any discussion of moral hazard and legal obstacles, both of which can be discussed once the dust settles,” said Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at ADM Investor Services International.

As a result, “some semblance of calm has been restored. This crisis is far from over, but at least some of the immediate risks of an exponential ballooning of contagion effects have been mitigated.”

SO WE CAN SOUND THE ALL CLEAR?

Not yet. UBS shares initially plunged Monday on fears that the bank has simply inherited trouble by buying Credit Suisse. The share later turned positive. And the way the takeover was done, by wiping out some of the Credit Suisse's bondholders, rattled markets in those bonds. So new problems could arise.

“Containing crises is a bit like a game of whack-a-mole — with new fires starting as existing ones are extinguished,” said Neal Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics. “A key issue over the next week will be whether problems arise in other institutions or parts of the financial system.""

Among the lingering worries: Did other U.S. banks ignore the risk that interest rates might swiftly rise, as Silicon Valley did? Could there be trouble in other parts of the financial sector that don’t take insured deposits, such as investment banks, hedge funds and mortgage brokers?

Said Shearing: “A reasonable base case is that we avoid a system-wide crisis on the scale of 2007-08, but further problems emerge at individual institutions.”

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR SWISS BANKS?

In the global financial crisis, it was UBS that needed government help, while Credit Suisse did not. Now UBS faces the task of integrating Credit Suisse and sorting out its problems.

Switzerland, which had five big banks 30 years ago, is now left with one very large bank that’s “too big to fail.”

“That means the government is even more challenged to support any problems in the financial system,” said Tobias Straumann, an economic history professor at the University of Zurich.

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY?

Analysts say pressure from markets and regulators may now make banks less likely to risk new lending, which could restrict credit for new purchases or investment in new businesses.

If credit is seen to tighten because of fears over banks, central banks such as the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England might choose to slow down their recent rapid interest rate increases aimed at fighting inflation — or to stop the increases at a lower level than they otherwise would have.

Tighter credit, whether from nervous banks or from central bankers raising rates, tends to counteract inflation.

That was behind European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde's statement last week after the bank raised rates by a half-percentage point. She said further rate decisions would be taken meeting to meeting based on the latest data.

Lagarde said Monday that the current financial tensions “might have an impact on demand and might actually do some of the work that might otherwise be done by monetary policy.”

https://www.ibtimes.com/credit-suisse-bank-sunk-scandals-3678347,Credit Suisse: A Bank Sunk By Scandals,"Credit Suisse was a pillar of Swiss banking that rapidly collapsed, its foundations fatally undercut by repeated missteps that left it shaky when storms in the banking sector began swirling.

One of 30 banks worldwide deemed too big to fail, its share price collapsed on Wednesday and before Sunday was out, its remains were being taken over by domestic rivals UBS.

It had been seen as the weakest link in the chain and blew over like a house of cards once fears of a domino effect began bubbling up after the collapse of two US lenders.

Here is an overview of the woes that brought down Credit Suisse:

The catalogue of troubles began with the 2021 collapse of Greensill, a British financial firm specialised in short-term corporate loans via a complex and opaque business model.

Greensill's collapse threw a number of companies into difficulty -- none more than Credit Suisse, which was particularly heavily invested in the firm.

In March 2021, after Greensill declared insolvency, Credit Suisse closed four connected funds in which around $10 billion had been invested.

Swiss financial regulator FINMA concluded that the bank ""seriously breached its supervisory obligations"" and ordered ""remedial measures.""

Just four weeks after the Greensill collapse, Credit Suisse was rocked by the implosion of US hedge fund Archegos, which cost the bank more than $5 billion.

In October 2021, the bank was fined $475 million by US and British authorities after it was caught up in a bribery scandal in Mozambique involving loans to state-owned companies.

The credits, granted between 2013 and 2016, were supposed to finance maritime surveillance, fishing and shipyard projects, but were partly diverted for bribes.

The bank agreed with the British authorities to cancel the $200 million owed by the southeast African country, which was plunged into a serious financial crisis.

Former Lloyds Banking Group chief Antonio Horta-Osorio was brought in as Credit Suisse chairman in April 2021, pledging to put better risk management at the heart of its culture.

Less than nine months later, he resigned after it emerged he had violated Switzerland's Covid quarantine rules.

A media investigation published in February 2022, dubbed ""Suisse Secrets"", alleged that the bank had held billions of dollars of dirty money for decades.

The probe, coordinated by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, said leaked information on more than 18,000 bank accounts dating back to the 1940s showed Credit Suisse held more than $8 billion in the accounts of criminals, dictators and rights abusers.

The bank rejected the findings, saying they were ""based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context"".

At the end of March 2022, a Bermuda judge ruled that former Georgian prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili had suffered a loss of $553 million due to failures by Credit Suisse Life Bermuda, a Credit Suisse affiliate, to fulfil its fiduciary duty.

The case stemmed from the actions of Patrice Lescaudron, a former star banker at Credit Suisse sentenced by Swiss authorities to five years in prison in 2018 on charges of fraud and forgery. Lescaudron committed suicide in 2020.

The court found that the Credit Suisse affiliate ""was prioritising the revenues Mr Lescaudron generated for Credit Suisse over the interests of its clients"".

In June 2022, Credit Suisse was slapped with a $2 million fine in a money laundering case linked to a Bulgarian cocaine network.

Switzerland's Federal Criminal Court ruled that the bank had failed to take steps to prevent money laundering by the criminal organisation, deeming it guilty of breaching its corporate responsibility in a case dating back to 2007 and 2008.

In October 2022, Credit Suisse said it would pay $495 million to settle a row with the US state of New Jersey over mortgage-backed securities dating back to the 2008 financial crisis.

In France that same month, it agreed to pay 238 million euros to avoid prosecution on money laundering and tax fraud charges brought in 2016 over undeclared accounts held by French nationals.

Credit Suisse was forced to postpone its annual report, which had been scheduled to be published last week, after a last-minute call from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over revisions made to cash-flow statements for 2019 and 2020.

When it finally released the report on Tuesday, it acknowledged ""material weaknesses"" in its internal controls.

Following fears of contagion from the collapse of two US banks, comments from Credit Suisse's main shareholder Wednesday that it would not invest more money in the bank sparked market panic.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/19/business/ubs-credit-suisse.html,UBS Agrees to Buy Rival Credit Suisse,"To provide financial support to UBS to carry out the deal, the Swiss National Bank agreed to lend up to 100 billion Swiss francs. And Finma, the Swiss financial regulator, undertook several extraordinary steps to help UBS quickly digest its chief competitor, including wiping out $17 billion worth of Credit Suisse’s bonds and eliminating the need for UBS shareholders to vote on the deal.

So hastily assembled was the deal that UBS told analysts that they had not had time to fully model all of the financial impacts of buying Credit Suisse.

As Credit Suisse’s stock and bonds faltered over the past week, analysts and investors increasingly speculated that the Swiss government would force the firm to merge with UBS to avoid chaos. Indeed, several times on Sunday, UBS executives emphasized that the negotiations had been initiated by Swiss regulators.

In the past week, as depositors withdrew billions of dollars of their money, and other financial institutions unwound deals with the bank, it became apparent to regulators that Credit Suisse might not be able to open for business absent a takeover by the government or UBS, one person familiar with the negotiations said.

Until the last minute, both sides were unsure that they would be able to pull off a deal because they were far apart on its terms. On Saturday night, UBS offered to buy Credit Suisse for roughly $1 billion, but the bank’s board rebuffed that proposal, according to the person familiar with the negotiations. Credit Suisse had argued that its real estate holdings alone were worth around that amount, another person familiar with the negotiations said.

Still, UBS was the only viable suitor, as the Swiss government was prepared to offer special protective terms only to a Swiss institution, according to one of the people familiar with the deal.

Credit Suisse had been struggling to turn itself around in recent months, but two events last week contributed to its downfall. The bank disclosed on Tuesday that there were “material weaknesses” in its financial reporting. And it was swept up in the broad and intensifying panic around the health of banks. As shares in lenders around the world tumbled after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, markets grew especially wary of Credit Suisse.","['Michael J.

GENEVA -- Fury at top Credit Suisse managers. Lament over damage to Switzerland's image as a stable, reliable banking center. Relief that authorities stepped in to help protect deposits, but worry about keeping cash invested in a bank that failed to manage its own money adequately.

On Swiss streets, emotions were running the gamut among Credit Suisse customers after the government this weekend orchestrated a takeover of the country's second-largest bank by rival UBS — a bid to prevent further upheaval in the global financial system that began with the collapse of two U.S. banks.

How the merger, with a fire-sale price of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion), will play out and its impact on worldwide finance are largely unknown. That has left those stuck in the middle — customers and bank workers — uncertain about what comes next in the deal to create one Swiss megabank.

“My money is already invested in two or three banking establishments,” customer Elisabeth Pictet said after exiting the biggest Credit Suisse branch in central Geneva. ""I am not a millionaire, but it is true that in the long run maybe I will even more favor local, regional banking establishments.”

Pictet — whose husband hails from a legendary banking family in Switzerland — said she's not gotten any communication from the bank about how to proceed but praised the government for a “wise decision” that reassured many Swiss residents like her. She said Tuesday that she's had no trouble withdrawing cash.

“I feel a lot of anger at Credit Suisse managers because in the end, their employees will lose their jobs — many employees who did their work professionally,"" said Pictet, 59, who is transitioning into retirement from a health care job. “Now, we'll only have a single big bank — UBS — and that is not good: It's good to have competition, and we won't have that anymore.”

Asked if Credit Suisse had told customers how to manage their assets since the deal emerged Sunday, a bank spokeswoman said that “until the transaction has closed, business continues as usual for Credit Suisse and its clients.”

That likely won't be the case for Credit Suisse's 50,000 workers, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland, as the two banks combine. The Swiss bank employee’s association is demanding that job losses be held to a minimum, that no layoffs happen until year's end, and the government provide an unspecified jobs guarantee.

“It is impermissible that the companies are secured by tax dollars but the employees come away with nothing,"" the group said in a prepared statement. ""The billions in guarantees from the federal government must be linked to conditions favorable to the employees.”

The impact of the merger is extensive. Many of Switzerland's 8.5 million people have accounts in either UBS or Credit Suisse.

“I myself am grateful as a customer that this worked out,” said Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter at a news conference Sunday to announce the hastily arranged deal.

She said she has accounts at both banks.

“I think what we have done now is really to protect those people who have money at Credit Suisse,"" Keller-Sutter said, with small- and medium-size companies able to keep paying their workers, carry out transactions and access their savings.

Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas LLC, agreed that Credit Suisse depositors need not worry about their money now — though he noted reports of snap withdrawals worth billions of dollars last week amid confusion about the bank's future.

The Swiss central bank and government have since guaranteed loans to the combined bank worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

“Basically, the Swiss National Bank has stepped in and said, ‘Your deposits are safe,'"" said Marenzi, whose firm focuses on capital markets.

Bank runs are a risk for even the biggest and safest banks, but ""with Credit Suisse, things look very, very safe indeed at this stage in terms of deposits. So I wouldn’t be in a rush to move money out of there,” he said.

It's a different story for those who entrusted their money to Credit Suisse for wealth management or investment advice.

“Those customers are scratching their heads and saying, ‘Well, if you can’t manage your own money, why would you be able to manage mine?’ And that’s a fair question,” Marenzi said.

Swiss regulators and officials, reportedly under intense pressure from other Western governments and ultra-rich investors, forged the Credit Suisse takeover by UBS in a bid to stop more banking-sector turmoil.

Credit Suisse's problems — ranging from big losses on hedge fund bets to a spying scandal and failing to prevent money laundering by a Bulgarian cocaine ring — predated the recent collapse of U.S. banks but drew fears about its vulnerability.

For some in Geneva, there was sentimentality about the looming disappearance of a storied Swiss bank whose origins date to the budding railroad industry in the mid-19th century.

Credit Suisse customer Mokhtar Zada, 78, a retired former financial-sector worker originally from Afghanistan, said the demise of Credit Suisse wouldn't affect him because he too has an account at UBS and could just transfer money to it if necessary.

“But what a waste,"" said Zada, clutching a Credit Suisse savings booklet that he first received in 1965 and had shown as a sort of souvenir to bank employees. “It’s really too bad that a bank with 170-odd years of history is going to vanish just like that.”

https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/29/investing/credit-suisse-american-tax-evasion/index.html,"Credit Suisse is still helping ultra-wealthy Americans evade taxes, Senate panel says","New York CNN —

Credit Suisse is complicit in ongoing tax evasion by ultra-wealthy Americans, including a potentially criminal conspiracy involving the failure to disclose nearly $100 million in secret offshore accounts held by a single family, a Senate investigation released Wednesday finds.

The two-year investigation by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden alleges major violations of the 2014 plea agreement Credit Suisse reached with the US Justice Department after it enabled thousands of wealthy Americans to avoid taxes.

“At the center of this investigation are greedy Swiss bankers and catnapping government regulators,” Wyden said in a statement, “and the result appears to be a massive, ongoing conspiracy to help ultra-wealthy US citizens to evade taxes and rip off their fellow Americans.”

The Senate panel said Credit Suisse, under pressure from investigators, has identified 23 additional large and undeclared accounts belonging to ultra-wealthy Americans, each with assets above $20 million. More reviews are underway, the Senate committee said.

The panel also said it uncovered a previously unknown and ongoing effort by Credit Suisse to hide nearly $100 million in secret offshore accounts belonging to a single family of American taxpayers.

All told, the committee estimates more than $700 million in concealed accounts held at Credit Suisse in violation of that 2014 plea deal.

The Senate investigation also found that former senior bankers at Credit Suisse were involved in the management of these large and undeclared offshore accounts.

In a statement to CNN on Wednesday, a Credit Suisse spokesperson said the bank does not tolerate tax evasion.

“In its core, the report describes legacy issues, some from a decade ago, and we have implemented extensive enhancements since then to root out individuals who seek to conceal assets from tax authorities,” the bank spokesperson said in the statement.

Credit Suisse said its new leadership has cooperated with the Senate inquiry.

“Our clear policy is to close undeclared accounts when identified, and to discipline any employee who fails to comply with bank policy or falls short of Credit Suisse’s standards of conduct. Credit Suisse is also actively cooperating with US authorities including the DOJ to address some remaining legacy conduct or policy concerns, and will continue to do so,” the spokesperson said in the statement.

In 2014, Credit Suisse pled guilty to federal charges that it illegally allowed some US clients evade their taxes for decades. The bank agreed to pay a total of $2.6 billion to the federal government and New York regulators.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/23/investing/credit-suisse-ubs-impact-switzerland/index.html,Credit Suisse rescue creates bank twice the size of Switzerland's economy,"London CNN —

The last-minute rescue of Credit Suisse may have prevented the current banking crisis from exploding, but it’s a raw deal for Switzerland.

Worries that Credit Suisse’s downfall would spark a broader banking meltdown left Swiss regulators with few good options. A tie-up with its larger rival, UBS (UBS), offered the best chance of restoring stability in the banking sector globally and in Switzerland, and protecting the Swiss economy in the near term.

But it leaves Switzerland exposed to a single massive financial institution, even as there is still huge uncertainty over how successful the mega merger will prove to be.

“One of the most established facts in academic research is that bank mergers hardly ever work,” said Arturo Bris, a professor of finance at Swiss business school IMD.

There are also concerns that the deal will lead to huge job losses in Switzerland and weaken competition in the country’s vital financial sector, which overall employs more than 5% of the national workforce, or nearly 212,000 people.

Taxpayers, meanwhile, are now on the hook for up to 9 billions Swiss francs ($9.8 billion) of future potential losses at UBS arising from certain Credit Suisse assets, provided those losses exceed 5 billion francs ($5.4 billion). The state has also explicitly guaranteed a 100 billion Swiss franc ($109 billion) lifeline to UBS, should it need it, although that would be repayable.

Switzerland’s Social Democratic party has already called for an investigation into what went wrong at Credit Suisse, arguing that the newly created “super-megabank” increases risks for the Swiss economy.

The demise of one of Switzerland’s oldest institutions has come as a shock to many of its citizens. Credit Suisse is “part of Switzerland’s identity,” said Hans Gersbach, a professor of macroeconomics at ETH university in Zurich. The bank “has been instrumental in the development of modern Switzerland.”

Its collapse has also tainted Switzerland’s reputation as a safe and stable global financial center, particularly after the government effectively stripped shareholders of voting rights to get the deal done.

Swiss authorities also wiped out some bondholders ahead of shareholders, upending the traditional hierarchy of losses in a bank failure and dealing another blow to the country’s reputation among investors.

“The repercussions for Switzerland are terrible,” said Bris of IMD. “For a start, the reputation of Switzerland has been damaged forever.”

That will benefit other wealth management centers, including Singapore, he told CNN. Singaporeans are “celebrating… because there is going to be a huge inflow of funds into other wealth management jurisdictions.”

Too big to fail?

At roughly $1.7 trillion, the combined assets of the new entity amount to double the size of Switzerland’s annual economic output. By deposits and loans to Swiss customers, UBS will now be bigger than the next two local banks combined.

With a roughly 30% market share in Swiss banking, “we see too much concentration risk and market share control,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note last week before the deal was done. They suggested that the combined entity would need to exit or IPO some businesses.

The problem with having one single large bank in a small economy is that if it faces a bank run or needs a bailout — which UBS did during the 2008 crisis — the government’s financial firepower may be insufficient.

At 333 billion francs ($363 billion), local deposits in the new entity equal 45% of GDP — an enormous amount even for a country with healthy public finances and low levels of debt.

On the other hand, UBS is in a much stronger financial position than it was during the 2008 crisis and it will be required to build up an even bigger financial buffer as a result of the deal. The Swiss financial regulator, FINMA, has said it will “very closely monitor the transaction and compliance with all requirements under supervisory law.”

UBS chairman Colm Kelleher underscored the health of UBS’s balance sheet Sunday at a press conference on the deal. “Having been chief financial officer [at Morgan Stanley] during the last global financial crisis, I’m well aware of the importance of a solid balance sheet. UBS will remain rock-solid,” he said.

Kelleher added that UBS would trim Credit Suisse’s investment bank “and align it with our conservative risk culture.”

Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said “the question of market concentration in Switzerland is something to address in future.” “30% [market share] is higher than you might ideally want but not so high that it’s a major problem.”

The deal has “surgically removed the most worrying part of [Switzerland’s] banking system,” leaving it stronger, Kenningham added.

Jobs and competition

The deal will have an adverse affect on jobs, though, likely adding to the 9,000 cuts that Credit Suisse already announced as part of an earlier turnaround plan.

For Switzerland, the threat is acute. The two banks collectively employ more than 37,000 people in the country, about 18% of the financial sector’s workforce, and there is bound to be overlap.

“The Credit Suisse branch in the city where I live is right in front of UBS’s, meaning one of the two will certainly close,” Bris of IMD wrote in a note Monday.

In a call with analysts Sunday night, UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said the bank would try to remove 8 billion francs ($8.9 billion) of costs a year by 2027, 6 billion francs ($6.5 billion) of which would come from reducing staff numbers.

“We are clearly cognizant of Swiss societal and economic factors. We will be considerate employers, but we need to do this in a rational way,” Kelleher told reporters.

Not only does the deal, done in a hurry, fail to protect jobs in Switzerland, but it contains no special provisions on competition issues.

UBS now has “quasi-monopoly power,” which could increase the cost of banking services in the country, according to Bris.

Although Switzerland has dozens of smaller regional and savings banks, including 24 cantonal banks, UBS is now an even more dominant player. “Everything they do… will influence the market,” said Gersbach of ETH.

Credit Suisse’s Swiss banking arm, arguably its crown jewel, could have been subject to a future sale as part of the terms of the deal, he added.

A spinoff of the domestic bank now looks unlikely, however, after UBS made clear that it intended to hold onto it. “The Credit Suisse Swiss bank is a fine asset that we are very determined to keep,” Kelleher said Sunday.

Integration is difficult

At $3.25 billion, UBS got Credit Suisse for 60% less than the bank was worth when markets closed two days prior. Whether that ultimately turns out to be a steal remains to be seen. Large mergers are notoriously fraught with risk and often don’t deliver the promised returns to shareholders.

UBS argues that by expanding its global wealth and asset management franchise, the deal will drive long-term shareholder value. “UBS’s strength and our familiarity with Credit Suisse’s business puts us in a unique position to execute this integration efficiently and effectively,” Kelleher said. UBS expects the deal to increase its profit by 2027.

The transaction is expected to close in the coming months, but fully integrating the two institutions will take three to five years, according to Phillip Straley, the president of data analytics company FNA. “There’s a huge amount of integration risk,” he said.

Moody’s on Tuesday affirmed its credit ratings on UBS but changed the outlook on some of its debt from stable to negative, judging that the “complexity, extent and duration of the integration” posed risks to the bank.

It pointed to challenges retaining key Credit Suisse staff, minimizing the loss of overlapping clients in Switzerland and unifying the cultures of “two somewhat different organizations.”

According to Kenningham of Capital Economics, the “track record of shotgun marriages in the banking sector is mixed.”

“Some, such as the 1995 purchase of Barings by ING, have proved long-lasting. But others, including several during the global financial crisis, soon brought into question the viability of the acquiring bank, while others have proven very difficult to implement.”",['Hanna Ziady'],2023-03-23 00:00:00

LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse's (CSGN.S) emergency lifeline from the Swiss central bank has provided the embattled lender with only limited relief, with its battered share price resuming its descent on Friday.

With investor confidence far from restored and markets fearful of a full-blown banking crisis, analysts, investors and bankers think the $54-billion loan facility announced on Thursday has only bought Credit Suisse some time to work out what to do next.

Here are some of the possible scenarios.

STICK IT OUT

Credit Suisse has spent years trying to revive its business after a series of scandals and losses. Chief Executive Ulrich Körner on Thursday vowed to continue with its ""strategic transformation"" to deliver a simpler and nimbler bank, focusing on managing money for the wealthy.

So, with the Swiss National Bank's boosting its liquidity, sticking it out with the turnaround strategy may seem appealing for now.

But some analysts think the loss of market confidence will eventually force management's hand.

""In our view, status quo is no longer an option as counterparty concerns are starting to emerge,"" JPMorgan analysts wrote in a research note on Thursday.

BREAK IT UP

Switzerland's second-biggest bank, already cutting jobs and shrinking, could be looking at its options to sell off parts of its business to raise fresh capital.

What happens to the long-underperforming investment bank is key: expedite plans to shrink the fixed income and equity trading businesses or wind up the investment banking operation entirely, are some options.

As part of the overhaul announced in October, it is seeking to spin off merger advice and leveraged finance into a new entity named Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB), for which it has been seeking buyers.

The bank may see more sense in monetising some its existing units.

Credit Suisse is most valuable in separate parts, and there are high-level M&A talks taking place, said a senior banker who advises banks on deals.

Domestic rivals like private bank Julius Baer (BAER.S) could be interested in parts of the business, the banker said, while Bloomberg reported last month Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) had eyed the asset and wealth management operations.

Credit Suisse could also pique the interest of other large European lenders, such as Italy's UniCredit (CRDI.MI), but the complexities of a deal, including persuading regulators, might discourage buyers, the banker added.

According to investment bank KBW's calculations, more than 12 billion Swiss francs ($12.9 billion) of value is trapped in Credit Suisse's domestic retail bank, larger than the group's current market capitalisation.

The SNB will probably have insisted on a timeline and solution when it stepped in, the banker said.

However, Credit Suisse's profitable private banking business, serving the world's wealthy, is arguably the bit management and Swiss authorities will want a shrunken bank to retain.

""It would be a pyrrhic victory to weather the storm and continue to trade independently if doing so stunted its recovery potential,"" said Guy Foster, chief strategist at wealth manager RBC Brewin Dolphin.

TAKEOVER

Selling off parts of Credit Suisse could require time, which markets may not give. A more decisive solution could be an outright takeover by a rival.

Analysts point to its bigger domestic rival UBS (UBSG.S) as the main game in town, although it would need Swiss authorities to support and consider competition concerns.

""I don't think UBS was super keen on this, but at the current price it might be a different story,"" said Jerome Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments, an investor in Credit Suisse debt.

The two have complementary investment banking businesses -Credit Suisse is stronger in credit and UBS in equities.

But a deal would likely trigger asset sales to try to address overlaps between the banks, Legras said. Even then, regulators might not be convinced of the outcome, a second banker added.

RESOLUTION

Few think shutting down the group is the more likely outcome, given the damage Credit Suisse's demise would cause to Switzerland's reputation as a stable and successful financial hub. It would also rattle global finance.

Should the bank's counterparties stop trading with it, or depositors flee the bank in ever larger numbers, analysts believe Swiss authorities would come to the rescue, possibly by back-stopping all deposits or making a direct equity injection.

But those options would expose Swiss taxpayers to huge risks too, evoking tough memories of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.

However, some have faith that Credit Suisse can still make it safely to the end of the tight rope. ""It's a precarious equilibrium, but it stands a chance of holding,"" RBC Brewin Dolphin's Foster said.

LONDON -- Credit Suisse shares plunged Monday after Swiss authorities cut a deal with its bigger rival UBS to acquire the troubled bank at a marked-down price. But European bank stocks and the wider market gained as investors watch whether moves to shore up banks will stem further upheaval in the global financial system.

Shares of Credit Suisse, whose woes stem from questions over its internal controls, closed nearly 56% lower a day after UBS said it would buy its fellow Swiss bank for a lowball price of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion). The shares traded at about the level they are valued at in the deal.

Swiss regulators orchestrated the purchase in a bid to stop more turmoil after the collapse of two U.S. banks. In an indication of the frantic, behind-the-scenes deal-making to resolve the issue before markets opened, the acquisition was announced late Sunday.

There is still uncertainty over how the deal will play out for the combined lender and what comes next for the wider banking system. Analysts say some previous forced bank mergers didn’t work out well for shareholders in the long run.

It could be that no more banks get into trouble, but it’s also possible that “we just go from one weak institution falling over to the next,” said Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser at Capital Economics.

There no other obvious candidates that could be singled out like Credit Suisse, but it’s “hard to predict where the problems will emerge,” she said.

UBS shares initially dropped on the Swiss stock exchange but closed up 1.3%. The deal whipsawed other European bank stocks, which tumbled before some clawed back their losses. Germany’s Deutsche Bank, France’s BNP Paribas and Italy’s UniCredit ended higher, while London-based Barclays sank 2.3%.

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after a central bank plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) last week failed to reassure investors and customers.

Many of Credit Suisse's problems were unique and unlike the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S., including high interest rates. Those U.S. failures have raised questions about other potentially weak global financial institutions, sweeping up the already beleaguered Swiss bank.

Credit Suisse has faced an array of troubles in recent years, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shakeups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

Analysts and financial leaders say safeguards are stronger since the 2008 global financial crisis and that banks worldwide have plenty of available cash and support from central banks. But concerns about risks to the deal, losses for some investors and Credit Suisse's falling market value could renew fears about the health of banks.

Tobias Straumann, an economic history professor at University of Zurich, said the merger was the right move because the U.S. bank collapses and the danger to Credit Suisse was “an international banking crisis in the making.”

“Markets are very nervous, and I think an additional accident in Switzerland would have fueled a lot of problems,” he said.

Credit Suisse is among 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities were worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

UBS is bigger but Credit Suisse wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. It has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich through its wealth management business, and is a major mergers and acquisitions adviser. However, Credit Suisse weathered the 2008 financial crisis without assistance, unlike UBS.

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in higher-risk Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out, leaving investors with hefty losses. Lawyers were already circling, eyeing possible legal action to get compensation for bondholders amid concern about the market for those bonds and other banks that hold them.

The combination of the two Swiss banks, each with histories dating to the mid-19th century, strikes at the country’s reputation as a global financial center — putting it on the cusp of having a single big national bank that would be too big to fail.

Some customers were caught off guard by the turmoil, at odds with Switzerland's reputation as as stable banking haven.

Sahil Dua, an Indian software engineer living in Zurich, holds a UBS account but opened one at Credit Suisse last Tuesday, the same day the lender flagged “material weaknesses” in internal financial controls that ultimately helped spark its downward spiral.

“My impression as a customer,"" Dua said, is “that at least these two banks were going to be fine, whatever happens.”

Dua said he wanted the credit card that came with the Credit Suisse account and that he considered switching over his primary bank account and bringing his savings from UBS. Not anymore.

He has a Credit Suisse account “with a balance of zero, and I’m glad that it’s still zero because I didn't add any money yet to it.” In the future, he plans to spread out his money in more than one bank.

“I will look into diversification more seriously now,” Dua said.

As the market tries to figure out what comes next after the merger, Straumann, the professor, said he wouldn’t be surprised to see problems for regional banks in Europe after further interest rate increases, much like what happened with midsized banks in U.S.

“The banking system of Europe has not fully recovered from the crisis” in 2008, he said. “It’s better, of course, than it used to be, but it’s vulnerable.”

The deal was “one of great breadth for the stability of international finance,” said Swiss President Alain Berset as he announced it Sunday night. “An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.”

Switzerland’s executive branch, a seven-member governing body that includes Berset, passed an emergency ordinance allowing the merger to go through without shareholder approval.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann called the sale “a clear turning point.”

Business Where to look for signs financial turmoil is hitting the U.S. economy With conditions changing by the hour, traditional economic data points — typically released monthly or quarterly with a lag — prove less helpful. Here are some better ways to gauge economic health.

“It is a historic, sad and very challenging day for Credit Suisse, for Switzerland and for the global financial markets,” Lehmann said, adding that the focus is now on the future and in particular on the 50,000 Credit Suisse employees, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland.

Following news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated financial moves to stabilize banks in the coming week. This includes daily access to a lending facility for banks looking to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice widely used during the 2008 financial crisis. Three months after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, such swap lines had been tapped for $580 billion. Added swap lines were also rolled out during market turmoil in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.

“Today is one of the most significant days in European banking since 2008, with far-reaching repercussions for the industry,” said Max Georgiou, an analyst at Third Bridge. “These events could alter the course of not only European banking but also the wealth management industry more generally.”

Colm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed the “enormous opportunities” that emerge from the takeover, and highlighted his bank’s “conservative risk culture” — a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse’s reputation for more swashbuckling, aggressive gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said the council “regrets that the bank, which was once a model institution in Switzerland and part of our strong location, was able to get into this situation at all.”

The combination of the two biggest and best-known Swiss banks, each with storied histories dating to the mid-19th century, amounts to a thunderclap for Switzerland’s reputation as a global financial center — leaving it on the cusp of having a single national champion in banking.

The deal follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further panic. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse’s share price began plummeting last week.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde lauded the “swift action” by Swiss officials, saying they were “instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.”

She said the banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.

UBS officials said they plan to sell off parts of Credit Suisse or reduce the bank’s size in the coming months and years.

The Swiss government is providing more than 100 billion francs in aid and financial backstops to make the deal go through.

As part of the deal, approximately $17.3 billion in Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out. European bank regulators use a special type of bond designed to provide a capital cushion to banks in times of distress. But these bonds are designed to be wiped out if a bank’s capital falls below a certain level, which was triggered as part of this government-brokered deal.

Berset said the Federal Council had already been discussing a long-troubled situation at Credit Suisse since the beginning of the year and held urgent meetings in the last four days amid spiraling concerns about its financial health that caused major swoons in its stock price and raised the specter of the 2007-08 financial crisis.

Investors and banking industry analysts were still digesting the deal, but at least one analyst was sour on the news because it could damage Switzerland’s global banking image.

“A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,” said Octavio Marenzi, chief executive of consulting firm Opimas LLC, in an email.

Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

The Credit Suisse parent bank is not part of European Union supervision, but it has entities in several European countries that are. Lagarde reiterated what she said last week after the central bank raised interest rates — that the European banking sector is resilient, with strong financial reserves and plenty of ready cash.

Many of Credit Suisse’s problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.

The deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably Wednesday, when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn’t invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.

On Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.

Its current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.

Although smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, and UBS did.

The Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

Swiss authorities pushed for UBS to take over its smaller rival after a plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and the bank’s customers. Shares of Credit Suisse and other banks plunged this week after the failure of two banks in the U.S. sparked concerns about other potentially shaky institutions in the global financial system.

Credit Suisse is among the 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

The deal was “one of great breadth for the stability of international finance,"" said Swiss President Alain Berset as he announced it Sunday night. ""An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.”

Switzerland's executive branch, a seven-member governing body that includes Berset, passed an emergency ordinance allowing the merger to go through without shareholder approval.

Additional tier-one bonds, AT1s, CoCos?

AT1 bonds is short for additional tier-one bonds. In short, they are bank bonds that are considered a relatively risky form of junior debt, therefore coming with a higher yield and are often bought by institutional investors. Sometimes they are also referred to as contingent convertibles or ""CoCos."" The name comes from the ability to convert them into either equity or write them off, so cut their value to zero — but only in specific scenarios. This is often related to the capital ratio of the bank that issued the bonds. If it declines below a certain level, for example, the contingency plan of investors converting their holdings becomes an option.

The AT1 origin story

AT1 bonds date back to the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when regulators tried to shift risk away from taxpayers and increase the capital financial institutions held to protect them against future crises. At the time, regulators in Europe established frameworks that specify capital ratios, so the balance between assets such as equity investments, AT1s and other, more senior debt. This is also the order they are meant to be prioritized in, according to the framework. In Credit Suisse's case, however, the investments of AT1 holders were written off, while common shareholders are set to receive a payout from the deal. In a research note, Goldman Sachs credit strategists said this ""can be interpreted as an effective subordination of AT1 bondholders to shareholders,"" making the move an unusual one. These bonds offered higher yields than many comparable assets, in some cases yielding almost 10%, reflecting the inherent risk investors were taking. The Credit Suisse AT1 prospectus, seen by CNBC, does suggest shareholders may be prioritized over these bondholders — but specifically if the bank fails. But bondholders have questioned whether the bank should be deemed ""failing"" in the traditional sense — a matter that will likely end up in the courts. Carl Weinberg, chief economist and managing director of High Frequency Economics, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday that regulators are meant to protect depositors and the system worked the way it should. ""While I feel bad about all these CoCos and AT1s who are losing their money … this is what the system was designed to do,"" he said. ""This is a perfect example of regulation.""

How they work and why they're risky

One of the key attributes of AT1 bonds is that they are designed to absorb losses. This happens automatically when the capital ratio falls below the previously agreed threshold and AT1s are converted to equity. Bigger banks often however have a substantial buffer thanks to the capital ratio requirements, so this outcome is rare — Credit Suisse's takeover was the first big test for AT1s. This is also where one of the main risks comes in — if the mechanism is triggered, bondholders can lose their investment entirely or end up with equity holdings in a weakened bank. Another factor that contributes to elevated risk is the power regulators have, who can, for example, limit payments on the annual interest rate of bonds, including with AT1 bonds. Finally, AT1 bonds are callable rather than maturing at a specific point. Usually, banks call and reissue them during a specific time period, but if they don't investors are stuck with them for longer.

What's next for AT1s in Europe

Various EU regulators have distanced themselves from FINMA's decision to wipe out the value of Credit Suisse's AT1 bond holders. Switzerland is not part of the European Union and so is not subject to the bloc's regulations. But some damage may have already been done and could impact the broader mood of investors. ""European regulators and central bankers are now attempting to restore confidence in the AT1 bond market, which now poses a major threat to any extension of the recovery in investor sentiment in the region,"" ING strategists said in a note published Tuesday.

But European bank stocks and the wider market gained as investors watch whether moves to shore up banks will stem further upheaval in the global financial system.

Shares of Credit Suisse, whose woes stem from questions over its internal controls, closed nearly 56% lower a day after UBS said it would buy its fellow Swiss bank for a lowball price of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion). The shares traded at about the level they are valued at in the deal.

Swiss regulators orchestrated the purchase in a bid to stop more turmoil after the collapse of two U.S. banks. In an indication of the frantic, behind-the-scenes deal-making to resolve the issue before markets opened, the acquisition was announced late Sunday.

There is still uncertainty over how the deal will play out for the combined lender and what comes next for the wider banking system. Analysts say some previous forced bank mergers didn’t work out well for shareholders in the long run.

It could be that no more banks get into trouble, but it’s also possible that “we just go from one weak institution falling over to the next,” said Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser at Capital Economics.

There no other obvious candidates that could be singled out like Credit Suisse, but it’s “hard to predict where the problems will emerge,” she said.

UBS shares initially dropped on the Swiss stock exchange but closed up 1.3%. The deal whipsawed other European bank stocks, which tumbled before some clawed back their losses. Germany’s Deutsche Bank, France’s BNP Paribas and Italy’s UniCredit ended higher, while London-based Barclays sank 2.3%.

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after a central bank plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) last week failed to reassure investors and customers.

Many of Credit Suisse's problems were unique and unlike the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S., including high interest rates. Those U.S. failures have raised questions about other potentially weak global financial institutions, sweeping up the already beleaguered Swiss bank.

Analysts and financial leaders say safeguards are stronger since the 2008 global financial crisis and that banks worldwide have plenty of available cash and support from central banks. But concerns about risks to the deal, losses for some investors and Credit Suisse's falling market value could renew fears about the health of banks.

Tobias Straumann, an economic history professor at University of Zurich, said the merger was the right move because the U.S. bank collapses and the danger to Credit Suisse was “an international banking crisis in the making.”

“Markets are very nervous, and I think an additional accident in Switzerland would have fueled a lot of problems,” he said.

Credit Suisse is among 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities were worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

UBS is bigger but Credit Suisse wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. It has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich through its wealth management business, and is a major mergers and acquisitions adviser. However, Credit Suisse weathered the 2008 financial crisis without assistance, unlike UBS.

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in higher-risk Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out, leaving investors with hefty losses. Lawyers were already circling, eyeing possible legal action to get compensation for bondholders amid concern about the market for those bonds and other banks that hold them.

The combination of the two Swiss banks, each with histories dating to the mid-19th century, strikes at the country’s reputation as a global financial center — putting it on the cusp of having a single big national bank that would be too big to fail.

Some customers were caught off guard by the turmoil, at odds with Switzerland's reputation as as stable banking haven.

Sahil Dua, an Indian software engineer living in Zurich, holds a UBS account but opened one at Credit Suisse last Tuesday, the same day the lender flagged “material weaknesses” in internal financial controls that ultimately helped spark its downward spiral.

“My impression as a customer,"" Dua said, is “that at least these two banks were going to be fine, whatever happens.”

Dua said he wanted the credit card that came with the Credit Suisse account and that he considered switching over his primary bank account and bringing his savings from UBS. Not anymore.

He has a Credit Suisse account “with a balance of zero, and I’m glad that it’s still zero because I didn't add any money yet to it.” In the future, he plans to spread out his money in more than one bank.

“I will look into diversification more seriously now,” Dua said.

As the market tries to figure out what comes next after the merger, Straumann, the professor, said he wouldn’t be surprised to see problems for regional banks in Europe after further interest rate increases, much like what happened with midsized banks in U.S.

“The banking system of Europe has not fully recovered from the crisis” in 2008, he said. “It’s better, of course, than it used to be, but it’s vulnerable.”

The Swiss National Bank announced the deal on Sunday, saying that it would “secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy,” following worldwide market panic after the fall of America’s Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.

Shares for Credit Suisse fell by 25% last week, stirring a bank rush by customers that resulted in withdrawal totals of $10 billion a day, the Financial Times reported.

In order to prevent a full blown meltdown come Monday, Swiss officials agreed to expedite the UBS takeover, offering a $100 billion liquidity line to Credit Suisse as part of the deal.

The agreement comes just a day after a meeting between UBS and the Swiss National Bank, where the company initially offered $1 billion for the takeover. Now, UBS will pay about 54 cents a share of its own stock to secure the deal.

UBS and Credit Suisse are among the 30 top banks in the world and hold about $1.7 trillion in assets together, with their company headquarters both based in Zurich.

Credit Suisse was the one on better footing 15 years ago during the 2008 financial crisis, with UBS being the bank that needed government assistance then.

But Credit Suisse has seen its shares fall by 84% over the past two years, with UBS instead seeing its stock soar by 15%.

As Switzerland’s second biggest bank, Credit Suisse employed more than 50,000 people at the end of 2022.

The bank saw 30% of its share price plunge overnight on Wednesday following market scares over the SVB and Signature Bank collapses, with the Swiss National Bank offering a $54 billion lifeline that was unable to save the bank.

Along with the merger of the Swiss banking giants, S&P Global Inc. is expected to downgrade First Republic Bank, again, less than a week after its initial ratings cut.

Sources told Bloomberg the ratings firm will announce the downgrade from BB+ to only B+ this week, just days after demoting it from A-, due to the impacts of the current banking crisis.

“Following Thursday’s uninsured deposit of $30 billion by the 11 largest banks in the country, together with cash on hand, First Republic Bank is well positioned to manage short-term deposit activity,” the bank said in a statement. “This support reflects confidence in First Republic and its ability to continue to provide unwavering exceptional service to its clients and communities.”

Swiss regulators orchestrated the purchase in a bid to stop more turmoil after the collapse of two U.S. banks. In an indication of the frantic, behind-the-scenes deal-making to resolve the issue before markets opened, the acquisition was announced late Sunday.

There is still uncertainty over how the deal will play out for the combined lender and what comes next for the wider banking system. Analysts say some previous forced bank mergers didn’t work out well for shareholders in the long run.

It could be that no more banks get into trouble, but it’s also possible that “we just go from one weak institution falling over to the next,” said Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser at Capital Economics.

There no other obvious candidates that could be singled out like Credit Suisse, but it’s “hard to predict where the problems will emerge,” she said.

UBS shares initially dropped on the Swiss stock exchange but closed up 1.3%. The deal whipsawed other European bank stocks, which tumbled before some clawed back their losses. Germany’s Deutsche Bank, France’s BNP Paribas and Italy’s UniCredit ended higher, while London-based Barclays sank 2.3%.

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after a central bank plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) last week failed to reassure investors and customers.

Many of Credit Suisse's problems were unique and unlike the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S., including high interest rates. Those U.S. failures have raised questions about other potentially weak global financial institutions, sweeping up the already beleaguered Swiss bank.

Credit Suisse has faced an array of troubles in recent years, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shakeups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

Analysts and financial leaders say safeguards are stronger since the 2008 global financial crisis and that banks worldwide have plenty of available cash and support from central banks. But concerns about risks to the deal, losses for some investors and Credit Suisse's falling market value could renew fears about the health of banks.

Tobias Straumann, an economic history professor at University of Zurich, said the merger was the right move because the U.S. bank collapses and the danger to Credit Suisse was “an international banking crisis in the making.”

“Markets are very nervous, and I think an additional accident in Switzerland would have fueled a lot of problems,” he said.

Credit Suisse is among 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities were worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

UBS is bigger but Credit Suisse wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. It has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich through its wealth management business, and is a major mergers and acquisitions adviser. However, Credit Suisse weathered the 2008 financial crisis without assistance, unlike UBS.

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in higher-risk Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out, leaving investors with hefty losses. Lawyers were already circling, eyeing possible legal action to get compensation for bondholders amid concern about the market for those bonds and other banks that hold them.

The combination of the two Swiss banks, each with histories dating to the mid-19th century, strikes at the country’s reputation as a global financial center — putting it on the cusp of having a single big national bank that would be too big to fail.

Some customers were caught off guard by the turmoil, at odds with Switzerland's reputation as as stable banking haven.

Sahil Dua, an Indian software engineer living in Zurich, holds a UBS account but opened one at Credit Suisse last Tuesday, the same day the lender flagged “material weaknesses” in internal financial controls that ultimately helped spark its downward spiral.

“My impression as a customer,"" Dua said, is “that at least these two banks were going to be fine, whatever happens.”

Dua said he wanted the credit card that came with the Credit Suisse account and that he considered switching over his primary bank account and bringing his savings from UBS. Not anymore.

He has a Credit Suisse account “with a balance of zero, and I’m glad that it’s still zero because I didn't add any money yet to it.” In the future, he plans to spread out his money in more than one bank.

“I will look into diversification more seriously now,” Dua said.

As the market tries to figure out what comes next after the merger, Straumann, the professor, said he wouldn’t be surprised to see problems for regional banks in Europe after further interest rate increases, much like what happened with midsized banks in U.S.

“The banking system of Europe has not fully recovered from the crisis” in 2008, he said. “It’s better, of course, than it used to be, but it’s vulnerable.”

FRANKFURT, Germany -- In a bid to ease turmoil in the world financial system, Swiss authorities engineered a plan for the UBS bank to acquire its troubled smaller rival Credit Suisse at a marked-down price.

It's another urgent attempt to fight fears that have put the financial world on edge 15 years after the failure of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers pitched the global economy into a crisis.

Here are key things to know — and some things that aren't yet known — about the takeover and the wider market anxiety fueled by bank failures in the U.S.

WHY IS UBS TAKING OVER CREDIT SUISSE?

Swiss authorities pushed UBS to take over its rival after the price of Credit Suisse shares plunged and depositors fled, raising fears that it could fail.

Credit Suisse isn't just any bank. Unlike midsize Silicon Valley Bank, which went under earlier this month in the U.S., it is one of 30 banks classified as globally significant because it could pose a risk of bigger trouble if it collapses, as happened with Lehman.

Credit Suisse's troubles pre-dated Silicon Valley's failure, including a $5.5 billion loss on its dealings with private investment firm Archegos and a spying scandal.

Then fears about banks fed by the U.S. failures made investors take a closer, less friendly look at banks. When Credit Suisse's biggest investor, Saudi National Bank, refused to put up more money, investors and depositors headed for the exits.

WILL THE TAKEOVER RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM?

Confidence in banks is shaky right now. That said, economists, bank regulators and stock-market analysts generally say that banks are in better shape than in 2008, with thicker financial buffers against losses and a slew of new regulations.

And this time, policymakers have been quicker to respond. The U.S. Federal Reserve offered credit to banks that suffered uninsured losses on bond holdings due to rising interest rates.

On Sunday, just ahead of the opening of markets in Asia, other central banks joined the Fed in expanding unlimited dollar credit to any bank that needs it. That was a swift preemptive move used in earlier emergencies such as the pandemic market meltdown of 2020.

Swiss officials balked at letting Credit Suisse just fail, unlike the U.S. government in 2008, when it let Lehman go under, spreading losses and fear across the financial system. Financial institutions had been in trouble since 2007, but it wasn't until two weeks after Lehman that the U.S. Congress came to the system's aid with a $700 billion emergency economic stabilization act.

Questions have been raised about the technicalities of the Credit Suisse rescue and the decision to insure all depositors at Silicon Valley. But officials are showing that they learned one lesson from Lehman, “namely to act decisively and swiftly, and if needed to run roughshod over any discussion of moral hazard and legal obstacles, both of which can be discussed once the dust settles,” said Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at ADM Investor Services International.

As a result, “some semblance of calm has been restored. This crisis is far from over, but at least some of the immediate risks of an exponential ballooning of contagion effects have been mitigated.”

SO WE CAN SOUND THE ALL CLEAR?

Not yet. UBS shares initially plunged Monday on fears that the bank has simply inherited trouble by buying Credit Suisse. The share later turned positive. And the way the takeover was done, by wiping out some of the Credit Suisse's bondholders, rattled markets in those bonds. So new problems could arise.

“Containing crises is a bit like a game of whack-a-mole — with new fires starting as existing ones are extinguished,” said Neal Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics. “A key issue over the next week will be whether problems arise in other institutions or parts of the financial system.""

Among the lingering worries: Did other U.S. banks ignore the risk that interest rates might swiftly rise, as Silicon Valley did? Could there be trouble in other parts of the financial sector that don’t take insured deposits, such as investment banks, hedge funds and mortgage brokers?

Said Shearing: “A reasonable base case is that we avoid a system-wide crisis on the scale of 2007-08, but further problems emerge at individual institutions.”

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR SWISS BANKS?

In the global financial crisis, it was UBS that needed government help, while Credit Suisse did not. Now UBS faces the task of integrating Credit Suisse and sorting out its problems.

Switzerland, which had five big banks 30 years ago, is now left with one very large bank that’s “too big to fail.”

“That means the government is even more challenged to support any problems in the financial system,” said Tobias Straumann, an economic history professor at the University of Zurich.

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY?

Analysts say pressure from markets and regulators may now make banks less likely to risk new lending, which could restrict credit for new purchases or investment in new businesses.

If credit is seen to tighten because of fears over banks, central banks such as the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England might choose to slow down their recent rapid interest rate increases aimed at fighting inflation — or to stop the increases at a lower level than they otherwise would have.

Tighter credit, whether from nervous banks or from central bankers raising rates, tends to counteract inflation.

That was behind European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde's statement last week after the bank raised rates by a half-percentage point. She said further rate decisions would be taken meeting to meeting based on the latest data.

Lagarde said Monday that the current financial tensions “might have an impact on demand and might actually do some of the work that might otherwise be done by monetary policy.”

https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1144954/why-the-ubs-takeover-of-credit-suisse-is-bad-for-bondholders,Why the UBS Takeover of Credit Suisse Is Bad for Bondholders,"UBS UBS has agreed to buy rival Credit Suisse CS for CHF 3.0 billion (USD 3.2 billion) as Swiss authorities sought to restore confidence in the financial system. This slashed the value of Credit Suisse’s shares, but it’s really the owners of the bank’s low-ranking bonds who are left holding the bag.

Under the terms of the transaction, Credit Suisse shareholders will receive one UBS share for every 22.48 shares of common stock. Based on Friday’s closing prices, the transaction values Credit Suisse shares at CHF 0.76, which is 59% below its last closing price of CHF 1.86.

The last-minute rescue failed to calm nerves early Monday, and bank stocks were under massive pressure throughout the morning.

‘A Real Dent to Market Confidence’

According to Credit Suisse’s news release, “Credit Suisse and UBS have entered into a merger agreement on Sunday following the intervention of the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, the Swiss National Bank, and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority. UBS will be the surviving entity upon closing of the merger transaction.”

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann called the merger “the best available outcome,” while UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher called it an “emergency rescue.” In a separate statement, UBS announced its intention “to acquire Credit Suisse,” opting not to share Credit Suisse’s use of the term “merger.” Combining the two banks will create an asset-management giant with more than $5.0 trillion in assets under management, including more than $3.4 trillion in wealth management. The corporate and investment banking activities, a long-term source of trouble for the Swiss bank, seem destined to disappear or be heavily restructured.

“The UBS takeover in principle is good news, an expedited outcome, rather than wait and watch to see if Credit Suisse could actually manage the necessary restructuring,” commented Michael Field, Morningstar’s Europe market strategist. “The problem for investors generally, however, is that a takeover like this really does hark back to 2008 and forced takeovers of Merrill Lynch and so on. Also, the speed at which Credit Suisse went downhill is worrying, and ultimately a real dent to market confidence.”

Seniority Is Thrown to the Wind

In a surprise move, the Swiss regulator ordered “a complete write-down” of the value of Credit Suisse’s CHF 16 billion in additional Tier 1 bonds, which are also known as contingent convertible bonds. This means that holders of these bonds will be left with nothing. Stock owners, who normally have lower priority than bond owners in a bankruptcy process, will still receive about 40% of the most recent share price under the deal.

Additional Tier 1 bonds are the lowest rung of bank debt. They are risky instruments that yield high returns when things run smoothly, but they are also designed to first feel the pain when a bank gets into trouble.

Their wipeout was perceived as a blow for European debt markets.

“What Finma [the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority] has done breaking capital structure will have a long-term consequence for any Swiss financial debt,” one holder of Credit Suisse additional Tier 1 bonds told in the Financial Times. A banker told the paper that the decision could lead to a “nightmare” in European debt markets, given that bondholders had heavier losses forced on them than shareholders.

Shortly after the deal was announced, the central banks of the euro area, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, and the United States announced that they would increase the frequency of dollar swap transactions from weekly to daily. This is to ensure the supply of liquidity to banks.

A Terrible Week

The crisis-ridden Swiss bank had come under intense pressure last week, triggered by the collapse of three U.S. regional banks—Silicon Valley Bank SIVB, Signature Bank SBNY, and Silvergate Bank SI. On Tuesday, Credit Suisse was able to publish its annual report with a delay, where it became clear that it continued to see liquidity outflows, following CHF 123.2 billion in outflows in 2022. According media reports, Credit Suisse was losing deposits at a CHF 10 billion per day run rate.

The bank’s terminal nosedive was triggered on Wednesday, when its main shareholder, the Saudi National Bank, said it would not provide further financial support. Credit Suisse stock tumbled by more than 30% and fell below CHF 2.00 for the first time.

Later that day, the Swiss National Bank offered to provide liquidity to the group, if needed. Credit Suisse accepted the offer just a few hours later, borrowing CHF 50 billion. The intervention failed to stop the bleeding, and Credit Suisse shares ended the week down 25%.

On Friday evening, the Financial Times reported that UBS was in negotiations about a full or partial takeover of its competitor. It became clear over the weekend that regulators and politicians thought the situation of Switzerland’s second-largest bank was no longer tenable. The deal was made public late on Sunday.

UBS Could Benefit From Takeover

According to Morningstar banking analyst Johann Scholtz, UBS will benefit from the takeover in the long run. “UBS is in a much better position to execute a radical restructuring of Credit Suisse’s business than Credit Suisse was,” he said. “We calculate that UBS’ 2027 cost savings target would reduce Credit Suisse’s 2022 adjusted operating expenses by around 60%. The restructuring will come with material costs, but UBS is better placed than Credit Suisse to absorb this. The challenge for UBS will be to keep revenue attrition to a minimum during the restructuring period.”

‘’Credit Suisse was on life support and Swiss authorities believed only a full transplant of the banks divisions into UBS would restore stability to the banking system,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets, Hargreaves Lansdown.

Swiss authorities began urging UBS to purchase Credit Suisse after the investment bank’s loan failed to reassure investors and customers.

The deal involves risk for UBS.

""It will not only have to accept the healthier parts of the business but its failing ones as well – particularly its investment division, which has been mired in crisis after crisis. UBS will now be looking to chop up and sell off big chunks of operations, to slim down in size, given that the combined balance sheet is twice the size of Switzerland’s economy,"" Streeter said.

Regulators faced a sense of urgency to push the deal through on Sunday before markets opened Monday as the specter of Credit Suisse potentially failing next week loomed over the negotiations. Credit Suisse, which has been in business for 167 years, is one of 30 globally systemically important banks, which heightened worries about how global financial markets would react to its implosion.

Talk about the UBS acquisition heated up over the weekend and involved the Swiss government's financial regulators giving it the green light after the sides came to an agreement over the more complex terms of the deal.

The deal involves a large amount of public support, with three tranches of liquidity and loans, as well as a pledge from the Swiss government to absorb up to 9 billion francs in potential losses from the takeover.

The total of 259 billion francs of support is equivalent to a third of Switzerland's entire economic output, which stood at 771 billion francs last year.

""The government's going to have to say to voters why they are putting citizens' money, taxpayer money at risk to bail out a bank that was predominantly servicing the ultra wealthy, doing some pretty extraordinary things with its investment bank and paying people crazy amounts of money relative to what the man in the street gets paid,"" one former global bank CEO, who did not wish to be identified, told Reuters.

Both banks have access to existing lending facilities and may obtain an additional loan of up to 100 billion francs (or about $108 billion), while Credit Suisse can also tap a second liquidity assistance loan of that size that's backstopped by the Swiss federal government.

""The substantial provision of liquidity will ensure that both banks have access to the necessary liquidity,"" the Swiss National Bank announced in a release. ""By providing substantial liquidity assistance, the SNB is fulfilling its mandate to contribute to the stability of the financial system, and it continues to work closely with the federal government and FINMA to this end.""

As a large global financial institution, Credit Suisse has an investment banking arm that it has tried to spin off in recent years, in addition to a local retail bank. UBS' acquisition of those divisions of Credit Suisse, in whole or in part, could create additional regulatory complexity for the firm given its own activities in those areas.

Layoffs are likely as Credit Suisse had previously pledged to cut 9,000 jobs as part of its restructuring, and the bank has investment and local banking divisions that overlap with UBS' operations.

However, in a memo seen by Reuters that was sent to staff on Sunday after the deal announcement, Credit Suisse reassured staff that their bonuses would be paid in full.

CREDIT SUISSE SHARES HIT RECORD LOW

Bloomberg reported that Credit Suisse balked at UBS’ initial offer of $1 billion and argued that it fell well short of the firm’s valuation, which stood at about $9.5 billion as of Friday, and that it would harm the bank’s employees and shareholders. The size of UBS’ offer was first reported by the Financial Times.

CREDIT SUISSE SHEDS NEARLY 25%, KEY BACKER SAYS NO MORE MONEY

UBS has a balance sheet of about $1.1 trillion – roughly twice the size of Credit Suisse – and has been more resilient than Credit Suisse in the years since the global financial crisis of 2008.

Credit Suisse’s distressed financial position arose from billions of dollars in losses from investments gone awry and fines imposed by regulators. Its assets dropped from $1.2 trillion in the third quarter of 2008 to $576 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022.

It’s currently facing class-action lawsuits from U.S. shareholders who allege that the company’s leadership made false and misleading statements about the status of depositors’ outflows last year.

https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/ubs-salvages-most-value-credit-suisse-wreck-2023-03-19/,UBS salvages most value from Credit Suisse wreck,"













NEW YORK, March 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - UBS (UBSG.S) Chair Colm Kelleher is buying Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) because he has to, not because he wants to. The 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.2 billion) rescue deal, brokered by Swiss authorities and announced late on Sunday, is designed to shore up confidence in the country’s financial industry rather than benefit the buyer. Even so, UBS is salvaging the most value from the wreckage.

The Swiss government, central bank and regulator FINMA concluded that a UBS takeover was better than letting Credit Suisse fail, which could have sparked a wider banking-sector panic. The job for Kelleher was how to avoid infecting UBS with its arch-rival’s problems.

He’s secured some handy protections. The all-share offer values Credit Suisse at 60% less than its closing share price on Friday, and at a fraction of its 45 billion Swiss franc book value at the end of last year. FINMA will also let UBS write off its target’s debt instruments, known as Additional Tier 1 (AT1) securities, boosting the combined group’s equity capital by about 16 billion Swiss francs. Meanwhile the government will cover up to 9 billion Swiss francs of losses, such as markdowns on Credit Suisse assets, past a certain threshold.

Thanks to a competition waiver, Kelleher can even keep Credit Suisse’s domestic unit, giving UBS a dominant position in local retail and corporate banking and allowing it to extract hefty cost savings. Chief Executive Ralph Hamers reckons the bank can cut about $8 billion of annual expenses by 2027. After deducting tax at 24% and capitalising using a 10% discount rate, those savings have a net present value of about $60 billion - roughly in line with UBS’s market value before the deal.

Yet it’s a sign of Credit Suisse’s predicament that the deal is far from a home run. On a call with analysts late on Sunday, UBS executives stumbled over some of the numbers – perhaps unsurprising for a transaction negotiated over a weekend. Wealthy customers who have money stashed with both banks could move some of it to spread their risk, while UBS might have to ditch some of Credit Suisse’s dicier clients. Hamers and his team will have to rapidly shrink their new acquisition’s investment banking arm, a tricky task even in less jittery markets.

Longer term, Swiss authorities have concentrated more of the country’s financial risk in a bigger juggernaut. That means even more regulatory and political scrutiny. FINMA’s decision to write off Credit Suisse’s AT1 securities just four days after it declared the bank was meeting all its capital and liquidity requirements will only increase the alarm felt by investors in other European lenders.

A UBS takeover is preferable to the Swiss government nationalising Credit Suisse or winding it down. And Kelleher has improved the chances of the rewards outweighing the risks. Whether it’s enough to soothe the wider financial sector is less clear.

CONTEXT NEWS

UBS will rescue Credit Suisse in a deal worth about 3 billion Swiss francs, Swiss authorities and the two banks said on March 19.

Shareholders in Credit Suisse will get one new UBS share for every 22.48 shares they currently hold. Based on UBS’s closing price on March 17 the offer values Credit Suisse shares at 0.76 Swiss francs each, well below the last closing price of 1.86 Swiss francs.

Credit Suisse’s 16 billion Swiss francs of Additional Tier 1 securities will be written off to zero, boosting the combined group’s regulatory capital.

The Swiss government will also grant UBS a 9 billion Swiss franc guarantee against losses arising from certain assets that it will get as part of the deal. The guarantee kicks in if losses exceed a threshold, which the finance ministry did not quantify.

The Swiss National Bank will offer up to 100 billion Swiss francs of liquidity support to UBS and Credit Suisse, plus a further 100 billion Swiss francs to the smaller bank backed by a federal guarantee.

UBS estimates that the combined group could reduce its annual costs by roughly $8 billion.

UPDATES throughout

Credit Suisse is in advanced talks with its larger Swiss rival UBS about a deal to salvage Switzerland's second-biggest bank, in a bid to reassure investors before the markets open next week, several media reported Saturday.

Embattled Credit Suisse was holding crisis talks this weekend and urgent meetings with national banking and regulatory authorities, said reports.

According to the Financial Times newspaper, Switzerland's largest bank UBS was negotiating to buy all or part of Credit Suisse, with the blessing of the Swiss regulators. An agreement could even be reached as early as Saturday evening, the paper reported.

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) -- the country's central bank -- ""wants the lenders to agree on a simple and straightforward solution before markets open on Monday"", the FT's source said, while acknowledging there was ""no guarantee"" of a deal.

Credit Suisse, the SNB and the Swiss financial watchdog FINMA all declined to comment when AFP contacted them Saturday about the possibility of a UBS takeover.

An acquisition of this size is dauntingly complex.

UBS would require public guarantees to cover legal costs and potential losses, according to a report by Bloomberg, citing anonymous sources.

The Swiss competition commission could also raise eyebrows depending on how any takeover by UBS might be configured.

The Swiss government held an urgent meeting to discuss the Credit Suisse situation on Saturday evening in the capital Bern. The government's spokesman refused to comment on the talks, Swiss news agency ATS reported.

The Neue Zurcher Zeitung newspaper said the government met at the finance ministry for a meeting that lasted around two hours, with several experts and officials taking part.

Like UBS, Credit Suisse is one of 30 banks around the world deemed to be Global Systemically Important Banks -- of such importance to the international banking system that they are deemed too big to fail.

""We are now awaiting a definitive and structural solution to the problems of this bank,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Le Parisien newspaper. ""We remain extremely vigilant and mobilised.""

According to the FT, citing two unnamed sources, Credit Suisse customers withdrew 10 billion Swiss francs in deposits in a single day late last week -- a measure of how trust in the bank has fallen.

After a turbulent week on the stock market, which forced the SNB to step in with a $54 billion lifeline, Credit Suisse was worth just over $8.7 billion on Friday evening -- precious little for a bank considered as one of 30 key institutions worldwide.

While FINMA and the SNB have said that Credit Suisse ""meets the capital and liquidity requirements"" imposed on such banks, mistrust remains.

Amid fears of contagion after the collapse of two banks in the United States, Credit Suisse's biggest shareholder said Wednesday it would ""absolutely not"" up its stake in the bank, for regulatory reasons.

That sent share prices plunging by more than 30 percent to a new record low of 1.55 Swiss francs.

After recovering some ground on Thursday, Credit Suisse shares closed down eight percent on Friday at 1.86 Swiss francs each as the Zurich-based lender struggled to regain the confidence of investors.

All eyes are on how Credit Suisse can stop another slide once the Swiss stock exchange reopens at 0800 GMT on Monday.

Credit Suisse has been scandal-plagued for the past two years with its own management admitting ""material weaknesses"" in their ""internal control over financial reporting"".

In 2022, the bank suffered a net loss of $7.9 billion, against the backdrop of massive withdrawals of money from its customers. It still expects a ""substantial"" pre-tax loss this year.

""This is a bank that never seems to get its house in order,"" IG analyst Chris Beauchamp commented in a market note this week.

Analysts at financial services giant JPMorgan, insisting that ""status quo is no longer an option"", considered the scenario of a takeover by another bank, with UBS ""the most likely"".

Credit Suisse share price Jean-Michel CORNU

The idea of Switzerland's biggest banks joining forces regularly resurfaces, but is generally dismissed due to competition issues and risks to the Swiss financial system's stability, given the size of the bank that would be created by such a merger.

""The question arises because there are many candidates which might be interested,"" said David Benamou, chief investment officer of Paris-based Axiom Alternative Investments.

""However, the Credit Suisse management, even if forced to do so by the authorities, would only choose (this option) if they have no other solution,"" he said.

“Bloomberg reports the gunslingers who foolishly kept holding Credit Suisse’s bail-in bonds are angry they are being wiped out,” Gundlach tweeted.

“Seriously? Put on your big boy pants and look in the mirror. That’s where the ‘blame’ lies. Learn how to manage risk!” he added.

Gundlach went on to suggest some debt managers had simply failed to properly assess the situation.

“Members of my investment team met with a very significant asset allocator last Wednesday, who reported that ALL of their ‘distressed debt’ managers opined that Credit Suisse’s bonds were ‘money good’, meaning would return par,” Gundlach said. “Only off by 100 points. To quote Rick Perry: ‘Oops.’”

The $17 billion writedown prompted outrage from the impacted Credit Suisse bondholders who questioned how the government-brokered UBS takeover was allowed to proceed under such terms.

Credit Suisse shareholders will receive 3 billion francs as part of the takeover deal.

In most situations, shareholders take losses before bondholders – a factor that has contributed to the outrage and led to accusations that Swiss regulators ignored well-established precedent while overseeing the arrangement. Bond giant Pimco was among the firms impacted by the deal, losing roughly $340 million on it AT1 bond holdings, according to Reuters.

“In my eyes, this is against the law,” Patrik Kauffman, a fund manager at Aquila Asset Management, a firm that invests in AT1 bonds, told the Financial Times.

“We’ve never seen this before. I don’t think this would be allowed to happen again,” Kauffman added.

AT1 bonds carry a high yield but are considered risky investments because they can be turned into equity – or wiped out entirely – if a lender is at risk of collapse. They were first introduced as a hedge following the upheaval of the Great Recession in 2008.

GENEVA -- Fury at top Credit Suisse managers. Lament over damage to Switzerland's image as a stable, reliable banking center. Relief that authorities stepped in to help protect deposits, but worry about keeping cash invested in a bank that failed to manage its own money adequately.

On Swiss streets, emotions were running the gamut among Credit Suisse customers after the government this weekend orchestrated a takeover of the country's second-largest bank by rival UBS — a bid to prevent further upheaval in the global financial system that began with the collapse of two U.S. banks.

How the merger, with a fire-sale price of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion), will play out and its impact on worldwide finance are largely unknown. That has left those stuck in the middle — customers and bank workers — uncertain about what comes next in the deal to create one Swiss megabank.

“My money is already invested in two or three banking establishments,” customer Elisabeth Pictet said after exiting the biggest Credit Suisse branch in central Geneva. ""I am not a millionaire, but it is true that in the long run maybe I will even more favor local, regional banking establishments.”

Pictet — whose husband hails from a legendary banking family in Switzerland — said she's not gotten any communication from the bank about how to proceed but praised the government for a “wise decision” that reassured many Swiss residents like her. She said Tuesday that she's had no trouble withdrawing cash.

“I feel a lot of anger at Credit Suisse managers because in the end, their employees will lose their jobs — many employees who did their work professionally,"" said Pictet, 59, who is transitioning into retirement from a health care job. “Now, we'll only have a single big bank — UBS — and that is not good: It's good to have competition, and we won't have that anymore.”

Asked if Credit Suisse had told customers how to manage their assets since the deal emerged Sunday, a bank spokeswoman said that “until the transaction has closed, business continues as usual for Credit Suisse and its clients.”

That likely won't be the case for Credit Suisse's 50,000 workers, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland, as the two banks combine. The Swiss bank employee’s association is demanding that job losses be held to a minimum, that no layoffs happen until year's end, and the government provide an unspecified jobs guarantee.

“It is impermissible that the companies are secured by tax dollars but the employees come away with nothing,"" the group said in a prepared statement. ""The billions in guarantees from the federal government must be linked to conditions favorable to the employees.”

The impact of the merger is extensive. Many of Switzerland's 8.5 million people have accounts in either UBS or Credit Suisse.

“I myself am grateful as a customer that this worked out,” said Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter at a news conference Sunday to announce the hastily arranged deal.

She said she has accounts at both banks.

“I think what we have done now is really to protect those people who have money at Credit Suisse,"" Keller-Sutter said, with small- and medium-size companies able to keep paying their workers, carry out transactions and access their savings.

Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas LLC, agreed that Credit Suisse depositors need not worry about their money now — though he noted reports of snap withdrawals worth billions of dollars last week amid confusion about the bank's future.

The Swiss central bank and government have since guaranteed loans to the combined bank worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

“Basically, the Swiss National Bank has stepped in and said, ‘Your deposits are safe,'"" said Marenzi, whose firm focuses on capital markets.

Bank runs are a risk for even the biggest and safest banks, but ""with Credit Suisse, things look very, very safe indeed at this stage in terms of deposits. So I wouldn’t be in a rush to move money out of there,” he said.

It's a different story for those who entrusted their money to Credit Suisse for wealth management or investment advice.

“Those customers are scratching their heads and saying, ‘Well, if you can’t manage your own money, why would you be able to manage mine?’ And that’s a fair question,” Marenzi said.

Swiss regulators and officials, reportedly under intense pressure from other Western governments and ultra-rich investors, forged the Credit Suisse takeover by UBS in a bid to stop more banking-sector turmoil.

Credit Suisse's problems — ranging from big losses on hedge fund bets to a spying scandal and failing to prevent money laundering by a Bulgarian cocaine ring — predated the recent collapse of U.S. banks but drew fears about its vulnerability.

For some in Geneva, there was sentimentality about the looming disappearance of a storied Swiss bank whose origins date to the budding railroad industry in the mid-19th century.

Credit Suisse customer Mokhtar Zada, 78, a retired former financial-sector worker originally from Afghanistan, said the demise of Credit Suisse wouldn't affect him because he too has an account at UBS and could just transfer money to it if necessary.

“But what a waste,"" said Zada, clutching a Credit Suisse savings booklet that he first received in 1965 and had shown as a sort of souvenir to bank employees. “It’s really too bad that a bank with 170-odd years of history is going to vanish just like that.”

Courtney Bonnell reported from London.",['Abc News'],
https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/19/investing/global-markets-ubs-credit-suisse-deal-intl-hnk/index.html,European markets recover on a wild day for bank stocks,"Hong Kong/London CNN —

European markets ticked up Monday but bank stocks were mixed and volatile as investors assessed the significance of the near-collapse of Credit Suisse, one of the world’s most important financial institutions.

Europe’s benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 1%, while Germany’s DAX (DAX) and France’s CAC 40 (CAC40) rose 1% and 1.4% respectively, recovering from losses earlier in the day. London’s bank-heavy FTSE 100 (UKX) was 0.8% higher.

The Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index, which tracks 42 big EU and UK banks, was 0.9% up. On Sunday, UBS (UBS) agreed to take over rival Credit Suisse (CS) in an emergency rescue deal. That was followed a few hours later by a coordinated move by major central banks to boost the flow of US dollars through financial markets.

“So far it looks as though those efforts have not been in vain, along with those of a selection of major central banks to ensure access to dollar funding continues,” said Craig Erlam, senior UK and European market analyst at OANDA.

“This is now the second weekend that central banks, governments, and regulators have spent putting out fires, and, while markets are recovering today, I’m not sure anyone is confident that all flames have been extinguished.”

Swiss-listed shares in UBS rose 2% Monday afternoon. Earlier in the session the stock had fallen as much as 15%, along with a broader fall in the European banking sector.

Credit Suisse shares were 56% in the red, broadly in line with the value of the $3.25 billion offer from UBS. Deutsche Bank (DB) and Societe Generale (SCGLF)shares slipped, while other big European lenders strengthened.

In Asia, HSBC and Standard Chartered slumped in Hong Kong trading. Both stocks also fell in London.

The Credit Suisse deal was aimed at stemming market panic unleashed by the failure of two US banks earlier this month. But investors were unnerved by the losses imposed on owners of $17 billion worth of Credit Suisse “alternative tier one” (AT1) bonds as one of the conditions of the rescue.

David Benamou, chief investment officer at Axiom Alternative Investments, a French wealth management firm with exposure to AT1 bonds called the decision “quite surprising, not to say … shocking.”

In the United States, the S&P 500 index inched up 0.8%. Meanwhile, the KBW Bank Index, which tracks 24 leading US banks, rose 2.9%.

In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index (HSI) closed 2.7% lower. HSBC (HSBC) led index losses, shedding 6.2%. Standard Chartered (SCBFF) shares in the city fell 7.3%. Both lenders are headquartered in London, but make most of their money in Asia.

By market close, China’s Shanghai Composite was 0.5% down, Japan’s Nikkei (N225) 1.4% lower and South Korea’s Kospi lost 0.7%. The S&P/ASX 200 in Australia decreased by 1.4%.

Credit Suisse rescued

UBS agreed to pay 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion) for Credit Suisse, about 60% less than the amount the bank was worth when markets closed on Friday.

The Swiss National Bank said in a statement that the agreement would “secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy.” Credit Suisse is one of 30 banks that are particularly important to the global financial system.

Just hours after the deal was announced, the Fed and several other major central banks announced a coordinated effort to boost liquidity in the global financial system with the aim of keeping credit flowing to households and businesses.

According to Stephen Innes, managing partner of SPI Asset Management, HSBC and Standard Chartered were facing greater scrutiny Monday as two banks that, similarly to Credit Suisse, have had “had their share of ups and downs.”

For Standard Chartered, recent speculation that the lender was a “takeover target” may be weighing on the stock, he said. Standard Chartered’s CEO told CNBC last month that the bank was “absolutely not” for sale.

HSBC, meanwhile, could be subject to investor jitters after buying the UK arm of Silicon Valley Bank, the lender that collapsed earlier this month, Innes said.

Calming nerves

On Monday, Hong Kong’s de facto central bank and securities regulator joined the chorus of central banks in welcoming the announcement from Zurich and sought to reassure the public that business would continue as usual.

“The exposures of the local banking sector to Credit Suisse are insignificant,” the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said in a statement, adding that the assets of Credit Suisse’s local branch were worth approximately 100 billion Hong Kong dollars ($12.7 billion) or “less than 0.5% of the total assets of the Hong Kong banking sector.”

The lender’s customers in the city will be able to “continue to access their deposits with the branch and trading services” as normal, the HKMA added. “Their overall exposures to the Hong Kong market are not significant.”

In Australia, Christopher Kent, the assistant governor of financial markets at the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), also weighed in, noting the recent strain on investors.

“Volatility in Australian financial markets has picked up,” he told a conference Monday. “But markets are still functioning and, most importantly, Australian banks are unquestionably strong — the banks’ capital and liquidity positions are well above [regulators’] requirements.”

Assurances from Singapore, the Philippines

Similarly, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said Monday that Credit Suisse, which has operated in the city since 1973, would continue serving customers “with no interruptions or restrictions, following the announced takeover.”

“Customers of CS will continue to have full access to their accounts,” it said in a statement, noting that the Swiss lender primarily catered to private banking and investment banking clients, not retail customers, in the city state.

“The takeover is not expected to have an impact on the stability of Singapore’s banking system,” it added.

The Philippines, too, moved to assuage fears.

On Friday, the country’s central bank declared that “​the Philippine banking system remains safe and sound.”

“We have shown our resilience through the pandemic, and we continue to be strong in the face of the ongoing turbulence in the global markets,” it said in a statement.

When Credit Suisse opened its first office in Saudi Arabia in early 2021, Bruno Daher, the cigar-smoking head of Credit Suisse’s Middle East business, declared it a “key growth market”.

The branch, at the intersection of King Abdullah and King Fahd Road in central Riyadh, was symbolic of the deepening relationship between the storied Swiss lender and the wealthy Kingdom.

Yet two years later, the relationship has soured spectacularly.

A Saudi investor played a key role in the demise of the 167-year-old Swiss lender after tin-eared comments sparked a run on the bank's shares.

In the process, the Saudis have blown up their own investment, sparking recriminations at home and raising serious questions about the country’s ability to gain a foothold in the global banking industry.

Credit Suisse has had a presence in Saudi Arabia since 2005 but ties have deepened in recent years as Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS) opened up the notoriously conservative kingdom to foreign companies and influence.

The Swiss bank won a local banking licence in 2019, allowing the lender to offer a full array of products and services as it sought a share of the oil-rich nation’s lucrative deposits.

When veteran investment banker Michael Klein was sent out by Credit Suisse in search of investors to fund a radical restructuring plan last year, he turned to his contacts in the Middle East.

To the delight of the board in Zurich, the former Citibank executive returned with a $1.5bn (£1.2bn) cheque signed by Ammar Al Khudairy, chairman of the Saudi National Bank (SNB).

SNB is the Kingdom’s largest bank, with more than $250bn in assets. It was formed in 2021 following a tie-up between the country’s National Commercial Bank and Saudi Samba Financial Group. Today it dominates the kingdom’s lending market with a 30pc market share.

The bank already held majority stakes in lenders in Turkey and Pakistan. However, Al Khudairy, an engineering graduate from George Washington University in the US, saw Klein’s approach as an opportunity for SNB to propel itself on to the international stage.

In October, Al Khudairy told the Wall Street Journal: “The Saudi market is the 700-pound gorilla economically in the region, and just getting [Credit Suisse] to engage with us in Saudi Arabia would be more than good enough.”

Despite his financial advisers raising concerns about the investment, following a litany of recent scandals at Credit Suisse, MBS directed the government-backed SNB to inject $1.5bn into the beleaguered Swiss lender last November.

For years, Swiss banks have acted as a haven for wealthy Saudi families. The crown prince wanted the investment to act as a flashy first foray for the kingdom into the global banking industry.

The investment made SNB the bank’s largest shareholder, with a stake of nearly 10pc.

At the time, Al Khudairy said: “We looked at the downside, we believe it is limited.” He hailed it as a “manifestation of the new Saudi Arabia” as the country sought to diversify its economy away from oil.

He has lived to regret those words. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) last month sparked fears of contagion in the banking sector, with fears centering on Credit Suisse. The bank had already seen shares slide over 70pc after a series of scandals and missteps.

Al Khudairy was asked on the sidelines of a conference in Riyadh whether SNB would consider injecting more capital into Credit Suisse. “Absolutely not,” he said.

Those two words precipitated the demise of one of Switzerland’s oldest banks, as well as Al Khudairy’s own career.

One senior investment banker says: “Had the Saudi bank head not said what he had said, I can't see the Credit Suisse saga playing out as it did.

“All he had to say was: 'We have not received a request for support from Credit Suisse. But if one comes we will consider it on its merits at the time.' But he didn't, and the rest is history.”

The comments triggered a sell-off in Credit Suisse’s shares and ultimately prompted the Swiss government to intervene. A rescue by UBS was hastily arranged over a weekend, an arrangement Swiss officials said was necessarily to prevent a broader financial crisis.

SNB and MBS were left red-faced and furious by the cut-price deal. Al Khudairy was last week ousted after losing $1.2bn on the investment in four short months. Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund and the Saudi-based Olayan family also took sizeable hits from the forced tie-up.

Beyond SNB, the debacle has raised questions about the future relationship between Saudi’s wealthy residents and Swiss banks.

Following its takeover by UBS, Swiss regulators controversially wiped out some of Credit Suisse’s bondholders, while returning capital to equity holders.

AT1s, which are a bank’s riskiest bonds, were introduced in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to ensure losses would be borne by investors, rather than taxpayers. They represent a key $275bn market for the funding of European banks.

Typically in a write-down scenario, shareholders are the first to take a hit before AT1 bonds face losses.

However, Swiss authorities inverted this hierarchy, letting shareholders get pennies on the dollar while AT1 holders got nothing.

Experts speculate that the decision was taken to appease the Saudis and stop them pulling business from other Swiss lenders.

The boss of a London-listed bank says: “I’m absolutely convinced it was politically motivated.”

He adds that, beyond keeping the Saudis on side, officials also likely wanted to give something back to longstanding domestic investors who had backed Credit Suisse for generations.

“My guess is that they felt the need to give some money back to the equity holders and it will be those at the lower end of the register, all the Swiss people who owned part of Credit Suisse because it’s been around forever,” he says.

However, the returns handed to shareholders pale in comparison to the market value of their holdings even in the days before Credit Suisse’s emergency rescue.

At SNB, chief executive Saeed Mohammed Al Ghamdi has now replaced Al Khudairy as chairman.

Mohammed Ali Yasin, chief strategy officer at Al Dhabi Capital, said Al Khudairy “was a victim of giving his honest opinion at such a tense time for Credit Suisse”.

He adds: “In hindsight, seeing the buyout rate of Credit Suisse by UBS, his answer was the right course of action: waiting for the crisis to be clearer.”

Shabbir Malik, an analyst at EFG Hermes, believes SNB is now unlikely to pursue its dreams of establishing itself as a global player in investment banking.

""[The Credit Suisse investment] worried certain investors mainly because SNB invested overseas at a time when the domestic opportunity is more compelling,” he said.

Al Ghamdi’s chief task for the moment will be simply to repair SNB’s reputation, while MBS will be assessing how the bank made such a costly blunder.

Meanwhile, UBS is embarking on a major cost-cutting drive as it integrates its former biggest rival.

As for Al Khudairy, he is unlikely to reemerge on the front lines of Saudi finance anytime soon.

In an attempt at gallows humour, the chief executive of the London-listed bank says: “I don’t know what happens when you lose your job at a large Saudi bank. Do you think he’s buried in the desert? I have this whole image that it hasn’t ended well. We’ll never see him again.”

Insider breaks down the likely winners and losers by division.,"The fate of Credit Suisse's investment bank hangs in the balance after being sold to UBS.

The investment bank's planned spinoff has been put on hold and bankers are bracing for job cuts.

Insider breaks down the likely investment banking winners and losers by division.

For many Credit Suisse staffers, the bank's fire sale to UBS over the weekend marked a sad but fitting cap to a years-long cycle of mismanagement and scandal. Now, the big question is what is going to happen to employees of its investment bank.

UBS executives said the $3.25 billion deal to buy Credit Suisse, struck on Sunday, will bolster the larger bank's considerable footprint in wealth management — while leaving little potential room to improve its conservatively run investment banking operations.

In an effort to shed light on the matter, Insider spoke to Wall Street recruiters, Credit Suisse insiders, and other experts for clues about what will happen to the investment bank, which has sizable operations at its US headquarters in Manhattan. People said they expect Credit Suisse's planned spinoff of its investment banking operations, announced last year, to be scuttled. They predicted that employees of many investment banking divisions, including equity research analysts and traders, could see pink slips if they don't land new jobs soon.

""The investment banking business at Credit Suisse is in a lot of trouble,"" said Oliver Rolfe, the founder of London-based recruiting firm Spartan International. ""There is so much overlap between one or the other.""

""They will either keep the core UBS franchise, or they will look through with a fine tooth comb, the plus points to bring over from Credit Suisse. Sadly, I can see a lot of people being made redundant,"" Rolfe added.

Last month, Credit Suisse said it had acquired boutique investment bank The Klein Group for $175 million as part of its effort to create an independent capital markets and advisory business. The new entity was to be headquartered in the US and called CS First Boston.

UBS executives have not confirmed whether The Klein Group sale and investment banking spinoff will continue as planned.

Credit Suisse did not respond to a request for comment for this story, and a spokesperson for UBS referred Insider to the bank's press release issued on Sunday. But inside Credit Suisse, some employees have been instructed to start looking for new work, one associate told Insider.

""We had a department-wide meeting today and they told us it's okay to start looking. They encouraged it,"" this person said. ""I've never been in a position before where people are telling us to look for jobs. I think most people have the mindset of wanting to look for something now, because we don't know what's going to happen with UBS. I think there's going to be a lot of interviews coming up.""

Over at 11 Madison Ave., where Credit Suisse's NY operations are headquartered, emotions were running hot on Monday.

""I'm very jaded. Very disgruntled,"" one Credit Suisse banker told Insider, noting that he's lost more than two years of earnings at the bank because of its recent decline since his compensation is tied up in stock. ""It sucks,"" he said.

At the same time, this person said the prospect of the UBS transaction was providing some much needed hope after months of turmoil.

""This is the first time in several months that there is a future. There is a vision,"" this person said, referring to UBS's plan for a focused investment bank with an emphasis on advisory and leveraged finance work. ""Best news in a while.""

See below who experts predict will be the winners and losers of the UBS rescue when it comes to Credit Suisse's investment banking division, from tech bankers to incoming junior bankers and more.

Technology banking: Winners

On Sunday, UBS executives said the bank will stick by a conservative plan for its combined investment banking operations to account for no more than 25% of the group's risk weighted assets — raising questions about Credit Suisse's investment banking role at UBS. That said, they pointed to some areas where they expect the Credit Suisse acquisition to expand UBS' footprint.

""Credit Suisse's strength, particularly in the US and the technology sector, makes a very good fit to our strategy, where we know that technology entrepreneurs are the wealth creators of the future,"" UBS's CEO, Ralph Hamers, told analysts, according to a transcript of the conversation from data provider Sentieo/AlphaSense.

""They provide quite some capabilities that are very strategic to us in terms of supporting technology entrepreneurs and wealth creation on that side,"" Hamers added.

Across global mergers and acquisitions broadly, Credit Suisse ranked seventh in terms of overall volume in 2022, according to the data provider Refinitiv.

Structured finance: Winners

Some of Credit Suisse's fixed-income sales and trading employees — the ones that didn't flee last year — may have fallen into a better fate than many of their peers at the bank.

Most of the Securitized Products Group, for instance, already secured a life raft before the March panic began. Apollo bought most of the business unit, and in early February it launched Atlas SP Partners. Mizuho picked off roughly 20 traders in the group that didn't go with Apollo. The Atlas group remains in the Credit Suisse building, albeit cordoned off on a different floor and using separate elevators, one source said, and they're probably feeling a world apart from their former colleagues right now.

But Apollo and Mizuho didn't take everything, and there are some ""hairier"" assets in leveraged finance that didn't get off the ship — areas in structured lending, distressed debt, emerging markets, and high-yield credit — that need tending to, recruiters familiar with the businesses told Insider.

UBS gutted its fixed-income business in a post-financial crisis overhaul over a decade ago. They've been rebuilding of late, but it's an area with less overlap between the two banks. Their long-term future isn't secure, but remaining employees with leveraged finance experience will likely still have jobs, according to the recruiters and a former employee from the division.

""UBS needs these people,"" one headhunter said.

Equity research: Losers

Credit Suisse insiders and watchers say that areas of overlap between the bank and UBS will be those where job cuts are the highest. One such division may be equity research, where experts publish commentary on market trends and evaluate the health of publicly-listed companies, experts said.

""Regarding the research side of the business, both UBS and Credit Suisse are full coverage,"" Spartan International's Rolfe said. ""Most of the analyst teams will have overlap. It then comes down to who are the star analysts in that team.""

The scope of Credit Suisse's equity research coverage is broad, spanning some 3,000 public companies and fixed income and macro areas like foreign exchange and interest rates.

Sales and trading: Losers

While some structured products traders might be thrown a lifeline, UBS' Sunday pronouncement that Credit Suisse's trading businesses will be considered ""noncore"" left other employees in doubt.

""We intend to derisk and downsize Credit Suisse's trading operations,"" UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher told analysts. In 2022, Credit Suisse's fixed income trading division brought in roughly 2 billion Swiss francs, while revenue in its equity trading operation totaled around 1 billion Swiss francs — a decline of 44% and 39%, respectively, compared to the year prior.

According to one markets employee, the fate of their team depends on the outcome of another deal: Michael Klein's bid to lead a revamped CS First Boston.

""The big question for my group is whether the First Boston spin-out will go forward,"" they said, adding that employees have received no definitive information to that end.

Some Credit Suisse traders and bankers are taking the initiative and not waiting to see how the UBS deal will pan out.

""I have heard from 25-plus Credit Suisse employees in the US, and 12 in the EU, interested in new trading or banking opportunities,"" Allen Branch, an executive recruiter who represents hedge funds at Finer Recruiting, told Insider.

Incoming analysts: TBD

College students scheduled to start their first investment banking jobs at the end of this summer are also in the dark, according to one former intern and now incoming investment banking analyst slated to start working for Credit Suisse in July.

The Swiss bank has been ""radio silence in terms of official communications,"" this person said. ""No one in the group has said anything explicitly, but I just know from people in other parts of the bank that they were saying, 'Hey, it would just be smart to have a backup option.'""

The student had been planning to live with one of his friends from the group that he met last summer. Now apartment hunting is on hold.

""Why go into a situation that I have no knowledge of and financially expose myself to getting a yearlong lease in New York? I could potentially not have a job and then I'm on the hook for $30,000 to $40,000. I don't know. There's just so many things going through my head.""

""I mean, if this happened back in the fall or even winter, it'd be a little easier, but it's pretty much April at this point. That makes things more challenging.""

Other banks: Winners

In Europe, one Geneva-based search consultant told Insider they had already begun receiving resumes from both investment banking and wealth management employees of Credit Suisse.

The recruiter said it was employees' expectations that UBS would likely sell the investment banking division quickly, either to US investors or to another major European bank.

Spartan International's Rolfe, the London-based recruiter, said that other banks — particularly the Paris-headquartered BNP Paribas or Toronto-based TD Securities — are expanding in the U.S. and could use this as an opportunity to bolster those operations.

For many Wall Streeters, though, such sudden moves are hardly out of the ordinary — even if these might be happening in more distressing circumstances.

""On Wall Street, it's the norm for bankers to work at four or five different banks over the course of their career,"" said Falguni Desai, a senior strategy advisor in banking and capital markets who advises Wall Street firms and has worked at banks previously.

""The bulge brackets have always had the appeal of a large well-known brand, a chance to work abroad and more opportunities for promotion. However, investment banking boutiques may be regaining their appeal. And it may be a great time for boutiques to pick up talent,"" Desai said.

Michael Klein: TBD

Longtime dealmaker Michael Klein once appeared a clear beneficiary of Credit Suisse's plans to spin off its investment banking and advisory businesses into a new-and-improved CS First Boston brand, with Klein at its head.

Now, the proposed CS First Boston deal hangs in the balance, with both industry experts and Credit Suisse employees uncertain whether it will go through.

Comments from UBS executives over the weekend did little to instill confidence that UBS does see the merits in building up the advisory-focused unit.

Credit Suisse has told staff that they will still be getting their bonuses and that staff must continue to work ""as normal,"" various news outlets reported Monday, citing two internal memos issued after UBS sealed a deal to acquire the 167-year-old lender.

""There are no changes to payroll arrangements,"" Credit Suisse wrote in a Q&A addressing concerns staff may have, per Bloomberg. ""We will pay salary and bonus, where outstanding, as per the previously communicated schedule.""

Employees' salaries and any bonuses that are due will still be paid on March 24, per the memo.

Credit Suisse also assured staff they will still be paid bonuses for their work in 2023, according to the memo. The bank's merger with UBS is set to close by the end of 2023.

The merger — which was brokered by the Swiss government — came after Credit Suisse's share price slumped last week amid jitters in the banking sector over the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, New York, and Silvergate Bank earlier this month. This put pressure on Credit Suisse, whose outflows have already been accelerating over the past few months.

Investors fear the fallout from the US bank collapses could spread and cause a global financial crisis, and the share price of Credit Suisse — which had been battling scandals for years — has been already been under pressure even before the current crisis.

Meanwhile, the bank is also telling staff that their roles are ""not immediately impacted"" and that they should ""continue to work as normal,"" per Bloomberg.

""We know that many of you will have been following the intense media coverage over the past 48 hours on the future of Credit Suisse and appreciate the enormous uncertainty and stress that this has caused,"" Axel Lehmann, the chairman of Credit Suisse, and Ulrich Körner, the bank's CEO, told staff in a separate memo seen by Insider.

But they added there isn't any impact on the bank's clients and day-to-day operations. ""Our branches and global offices will remain open, and all colleagues are expected to and should continue to come to work,"" they said.

Credit Suisse's share price closed 8% lower at 1.86 Swiss francs apiece on Friday. They are down 34% so far this year.

A number of Credit Suisse bondholders said Tuesday that they were considering legal action after $17 billion of the bank's additional tier-one (AT1) bonds were wiped out as part of its emergency sale to UBS .

Swiss regulator FINMA announced Sunday that the AT1s, widely regarded as relatively risky investments, will be written down to zero, while stock investors will receive payouts as part of the takeover, angering bondholders.

David Benamou, chief investment officer at Axiom Alternative Investments and a holder of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds, told CNBC on Tuesday that he would be joining the lawsuit along with, he imagined, ""probably most bondholders.""

California-based law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan said Monday that it had put together a ""multi-jurisdictional team of lawyers from Switzerland, the U.S. and the U.K."" following the rescue deal.

""That team are already in discussions with a number of holders of Credit Suisse's AT1 capital instruments, representing a significant percentage of the total notional value of AT1 instruments issued by Credit Suisse, about the possible legal actions that may be available to them in light of the announcement of the merger between UBS and Credit Suisse,"" the firm said.

The firm previously represented bondholders following Spanish bank Banco Popular's sale to Banco Santander for 1 euro in 2017, which also saw AT1s written down to zero.

The firm said it was planning to convene a call for bondholders on Wednesday to talk through ""potential avenues of redress.""

Was Credit Suisse failing?

Ordinarily in the event of a bank failure, AT1s — also known as contingent convertibles or ""CoCos"" — would be prioritized above equity holders.

The bonds were created after the Global Financial Crisis as a means of diverting crisis risk away from taxpayers. The Credit Suisse write-down represents the largest loss ever inflicted on AT1 investors since their inception.

The decision by Swiss authorities to upend the long-established norms and hit AT1 bondholders over equity investors has been criticized for damaging confidence in the asset class, potentially creating a spillover effect in global markets

The ECB Banking Supervision authority, Single Resolution Board (SRB) and European Banking Authority (EBA) issued a joint statement Monday seeking to reassure investors that the Credit Suisse deal is a one-off. Switzerland is not part of the European Union and so is not subject to the bloc's regulations.

""In particular, common equity instruments are the first ones to absorb losses, and only after their full use would Additional Tier 1 be required to be written down,"" the EU authorities insisted.",['Elliot Smith'],2023-03-21 00:00:00

Swiss authorities pushed for UBS to take over its smaller rival after a plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to $54 billion failed to reassure investors and the bank’s customers.

Credit Suisse is among the 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

The deal was “one of great breadth for the stability of international finance,” said Swiss President Alain Berset as he announced the deal Sunday night. “An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.”

The Swiss Federal Council, a seven-member governing body that includes Berset, passed an emergency ordinance allowing the merger to go through without the approval of shareholders.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann called the deal “a clear turning point.”

“It is a historic, sad and very challenging day for Credit Suisse, for Switzerland and for the global financial markets,” Lehmann said, adding that the focus is now on the future and in particular on the 50,000 Credit Suisse employees, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland.

Colm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed the “enormous opportunities” that emerge from the takeover, and highlighted his bank’s “conservative risk culture” — a subtle swipe at a Credit Suisse culture that’s known for more swashbuckling, aggressive gambles on bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said the council “regrets that the bank, which was once a model institution in Switzerland and part of our strong location, was able to get into this situation at all.”

The combination of the two biggest and best-known Swiss banks, each with storied histories dating to the mid-19th century, amounts to a thunderclap for Switzerland’s reputation as a global financial center — leaving it on the cusp of having a single national champion in banking.

The deal follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further bank panics. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse’s share price began plummeting last week.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde lauded the “swift action” by Swiss officials, saying they were “instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.”

She said the banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.

Though UBS is buying Credit Suisse, UBS officials said they plan to sell off parts of it or reduce the size of the bank in the coming months and years.

The Swiss government is providing more than 100 billion francs in aid and financial backstops to make the deal go through.

A part of the deal, approximately $17.3 billion in Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out. European bank regulators use a special type of bond designed to provide a capital cushion to banks in times of distress. But these bonds are designed to be wiped out if a bank’s capital falls below a certain level, which was triggered as part of this government-brokered deal.

Berset said the Federal Council had already been discussing a long-troubled situation at Credit Suisse since the beginning of the year and held urgent meetings in the last four days amid spiraling concerns about its financial health that caused major swoons in its stock price and raised the specter of the 2007-08 financial crisis.

Investors and banking industry analysts were still digesting the deal, but one analyst was sour on the news because of the reputational damage the deal might have on Switzerland’s banking sector.

“A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,” said Octavio Marenzi, chief executive of consulting firm Opimas LLC, in an email.

Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

The Credit Suisse parent bank is not part of European Union supervision, but it has entities in several European countries that are. Lagarde reiterated what she said last week after the central bank raised interest rates — that the European banking sector is resilient, with strong financial reserves and plenty of ready cash.

Many of Credit Suisse’s problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.

The deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn’t invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.

On Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.

Its current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.

Though smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, when UBS did.

UBS shares were down 14% in early trading on the Swiss stock exchange.

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after a plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and the bank’s customers. Shares of Credit Suisse and other banks plunged after the failure of two banks in the U.S. raised questions about other potentially shaky global financial institutions.

Markets remain jittery despite the best efforts of regulators to restore calm. Global stock markets sank Monday, with Hong Kong’s main index sliding more than 3%. Market benchmarks in Frankfurt and Paris opened down more than 1%. Shanghai, Tokyo and Sydney also declined. Wall Street futures were off 1%. Oil prices plunged more than $2 per barrel.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann called the sale to UBS “a clear turning point.”

“It is a historic, sad and very challenging day for Credit Suisse, for Switzerland and for the global financial markets,” Lehmann said, adding that the focus is now on the future and on Credit Suisse’s 50,000 employees, 17,000 in Switzerland.

Following news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated moves to stabilize banks, including access to a lending facility for banks to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice widely used during the 2008 crisis. Three months after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September of 2008, such swap lines had been tapped for $580 billion. Swap lines also were rolled out during market turmoil in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Today is one of the most significant days in European banking since 2008, with far-reaching repercussions for the industry,” said Max Georgiou, an analyst at Third Bridge. “These events could alter the course of not only European banking but also the wealth management industry more generally.”

Colm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed “enormous opportunities” from the takeover and highlighted his bank’s “conservative risk culture” — a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse’s reputation for more swashbuckling gambles in search of bigger returns.

The bonds are designed to be wiped out if a bank’s capital falls below a certain level, and that was triggered by the government-brokered deal.

That has triggered concern the market for those bonds and for other banks that hold them.

Credit Suisse, the troubled Swiss-based investment bank, received an offer from its intracountry rival Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) to purchase it for around $1 billion, according to the Financial Times. Swiss regulators spearheaded the deal to help restore trust and calm in a highly volatile global banking environment over the last few weeks.

The Wall Street Journal reported talks are still ongoing, and the deal may be subject to change. In the wake of the sudden closures of United States-based Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, along with concerns over the financial strength of the balance sheets of hundreds of small and regional banks, UBS and Swiss regulators need to plan for several exogenous factors that could impact the acquisition. One concern is how much money the Swiss authorities will allocate for guarantees or backstops if the worldwide banking situation worsens.

Both banks offer similar services. UBS and Credit Suisse provide investment banking, high-net-worth wealth management, asset management, stock and bond sales and trading. UBS has more than 74,000 employees working from nearly 50 countries. Credit Suisse is also global and the second largest Swiss bank with around 50,480 employees.

Prepare For Large Layoffs

It is likely that once the two similar institutions combine, significant layoffs will be announced. Since the two banks offer similar products and services, considerable redundancies will exist.

Recruiting on Wall Street for more than 25 years, I’ve seen this trend play out on many occasions. The firm initiating the takeover will drive the process and lean toward saving their employees—to the detriment of those who work for the acquired company.

Since there’s overlap in nearly all the divisions, intense competition between talented people at each organization will occur to keep their jobs. Leadership will likely let go of thousands of workers to save money, cut costs and streamline the new entity during a challenging economy.

Wall Street has already caught the layoff contagion. Top-tier New York City-based investment bank Goldman Sachs let go of around 4,000 white-collar professionals, impacting around 8% of the bank’s global workforce. Goldman laid off 500 employees in September as the economy faltered.

Morgan Stanley, a top competitor of Goldman, let go of around 1,600 people. Credit Suisse previously announced before the SVB implosion that it would ax around 5,000 jobs.

Wells Fargo laid off hundreds of people in its mortgage division because of high interest rates hurting the real estate market. U.K.-based investment bank Barclays, with a strong presence in the U.S., is exiting about 200 employees in its banking and trading units. Citigroup laid off about 50 traders.

Tens of thousands of people may be out of work due to the closures of SVB, Signature Bank, Silvergate Bank and other banking and financial companies with problematic balance sheets, forcing them to slash costs, including downsizing bankers and other personnel.

Why This Is Happening

Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old bank, is one of the world's largest money management firms, ranked among the top 30 global systemically important banks. If the bank fails, it could cause a significant contagion, similar to how the U.S. was concerned about the fall of SVB, which is much smaller than Credit Suisse.

The drama is playing out somewhat like during the great financial crisis. The federal government pushed JPMorgan to absorb the collapsing Bear Stearns investment bank, and Bank of America took on the once-venerable Merrill Lynch. Similarly, UBS was reportedly under the gun of Swiss authorities to acquire its competitor to avoid fueling the fire on an unstable global financial market.

History Repeats Itself

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon bailed out Bear Stearns at the behest of the U.S. government. Dimon said in a letter to shareholders a few years ago about whether or not he’d do this again, “No, we would not do something like Bear Stearns again. In fact, I don’t think our Board would let me take the call.”

At that time, CNBC reported that JPMorgan needed to fund $6 billion for severance packages, ongoing litigation, asset write-downs and an array of expenses. Dimon was cajoled to also picking up Washington Mutual, which saddled JPMorgan with toxic mortgages and legal responsibility for at least $19 billion in fines and settlements with multiple regulators in 2013.

UBS Is Concerned Over Regulatory Baggage And Backstoping Losses

Credit Suisse brings regulatory baggage. The bank had dealings with the now-bankrupt Greensill Capital and connections to the alleged scandal involving Bill Hwang's Archegos Capital Management hedge fund, creating a loss of $5 billion, representing about a year's worth of profit.

Credit Suisse now confronts the unpleasant matter of its shareholders being wiped out. Like other banks, the financial institution faced sudden withdrawals of funds. Venture capitalists called for the U.S. government to backstop any losses emanating from SVB’s shutdown, feverishly trying to get their money out of the bank, causing concern and some panic. Similarly, social-media-induced comments spooked Credit Suisse’s wealthy clients to take their funds elsewhere.

Given all the uncertainty, UBS seeks concessions and protections from the government. In addition to bank safety matters, UBS wants to be protected from pending regulatory investigations and legal issues, which could result in hefty fines.","['Jack Kelly', 'Amy Danise', 'Senior Contributor']",2023-03-19 00:00:00

When UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse at a fire-sale price over the weekend, a big question was what would happen to the ailing firm’s investment bank. Months before the chaos that felled Credit Suisse, the firm had unveiled an ambitious plan to spin out the division, under the leadership of the veteran deal maker Michael Klein, as part of its now-failed turnaround effort.

But it now looks like the investment bank will largely be dissolved, as UBS makes clear that it’s only interested in bits of the business, and as the Swiss government moves to bar some promised payouts to Credit Suisse’s bankers. What was once a top-flight shop of corporate advisers now appears to be a melting ice cube.

UBS probably won’t proceed with the Klein-led spinout, cutting off the most likely way of preserving big chunks of the investment bank. Under those plans, Credit Suisse would have purchased Klein’s advisory boutique, combining it with its own division and eventually spinning it out under the First Boston name. (Klein, who was on Credit Suisse’s board, would have received $175 million for his firm and was paid an additional $10 million for advising on Credit Suisse’s plan — terms that some at UBS reportedly saw as too favorable.)

UBS is now weighing whether to end that deal and how it would do so, DealBook hears. The writing had been on the wall since the takeover announcement: First Boston would have relied on capital from Credit Suisse to help fund equity and debt underwriting, and the UBS deal now makes that impossible.","['Andrew Ross Sorkin', 'Ravi Mattu', 'Bernhard Warner', 'Sarah Kessler', 'Michael J.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/ubs-brings-back-ermotti-ceo-credit-suisse-deal-98198740,UBS brings back Ermotti as CEO with Credit Suisse deal ahead,"UBS says it’s bringing back former CEO Sergio Ermotti to lead the Swiss bank as it moves forward with a government-orchestrated plan to take over struggling rival Credit Suisse

GENEVA -- UBS said Wednesday that it's bringing back former CEO Sergio Ermotti to lead the Swiss bank as it executes a government-orchestrated plan to take over struggling rival Credit Suisse.

Ermotti, who was the bank's top executive for nine years and led a turnaround following the 2008 global financial crisis, will take over next Wednesday from CEO Ralph Hamers.

Hamers took up the job in November 2020 and will remain at UBS during a transition period “to ensure a successful closure of the transaction and a smooth handover,” the bank said in a statement.

“Whilst Ralph was capable of doing the job, we felt that Sergio was better suited to navigating these things,” Chairman Colm Kelleher said on a conference call, alluding to the UBS board decision. “I cannot reemphasize how big this deal is in terms of financial history and financial engineering that’s required.”

UBS credited Ermotti, who is now chairman of insurer Swiss Re, for having “cut its footprint” and changing the culture of the bank — and it pointed to his experience in bringing big financial institutions together.

Ermotti, who hails from the southern, mostly Italian-speaking Swiss region of Ticino, acknowledged that “coming back to manage this situation is a challenge” but felt “a sense of call-of-duty aspect” to return.

Plus, he said he had contemplated a tie-up like the one with Credit Suisse while previously in the top job, and it would be a bit of a ”contradiction"" for him not to accept the post ""to basically execute on what I believe was the right next move for UBS.”

Kelleher said he called Ermotti “to explore the possibility of this” a day after the emergency takeover deal was settled on March 19, which involved Swiss regulators, the federal government and top executives at both banks.

“This is is the biggest single financial transaction since 2008. That brings significant execution risk,” Kelleher said.

The hastily arranged, $3.25 billion deal for Credit Suisse aimed to stem the upheaval in the global financial system after the collapse of two U.S. banks and jitters about long-running troubles at Credit Suisse led shares of Switzerland’s second-largest bank to tank and customers to pull out their money.

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after the central bank’s plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and customers. The Swiss executive branch passed emergency measures to bypass shareholder approval.

Uncertainties still lie ahead, including a U.S. Senate committee report released Wednesday that says Credit Suisse violated a plea agreement with U.S. authorities by failing to report secret offshore accounts that wealthy Americans used to avoid paying taxes.

UBS said it assessed outstanding lawsuits and investigations as part of the Credit Suisse acquisition and expects the deal to be beneficial for shareholders. It says it's working to close the sale and get approval from regulators in the coming weeks or months.

Hamers, the outgoing CEO, said UBS executives want to ensure “a digestible transaction” in terms of risk. He said there were plans to “manage down the investment bank” at Credit Suisse because many of the activities were not central for UBS.

UBS leaders announced no immediate plan about job cuts linked to the deal.

Swiss lawmakers and academics have raised concerns that the deal could create an unwieldy Swiss banking behemoth, while UBS executives said regulatory issues loom internationally before the deal can close.

Ermotti suggested he didn't view “too big too fail” concerns as a problem.

“I do think that scale and size is not a problem if it is focused and well-managed,” he said. “For me, the debate nowadays is not ‘too big to fail' but ‘too small to survive’ — and we want to be a winner.”

Many Credit Suisse customers have expressed regret at the looming disappearance of a 167-year-old bank that has been a pillar of Switzerland's renowned banking and financial industry.

Credit Suisse's stock fell significantly last week after the bank continued to experience net asset outflows and had to tap the Swiss National Bank for liquidity. It became quite evident to regulators that the bank would need to be acquired to avoid a systemic event, especially with the banking sector already struggling.

UBS was a likely candidate and the bank acquired it for a very attractive price of roughly $3.24 billion in an all-stock deal, valuing Credit Suisse stock at $0.82 per share. On Friday, shares had been trading at close to $2, which is why the stock is down so heavily today.

The deal includes more than $27 billion of downside protection to account for charges UBS is likely to have to take, purchase price adjustments, and restructuring. The downside protection also covers losses as high as roughly $9.7 billion beyond the first $5.4 billion that UBS would have to incur due to non-core asset losses from Credit Suisse.

Interestingly, Swiss regulators wiped out just under $17.3 billion of debt owned by bondholders, which is supposed to have priority over preferred and common stock.

Now what

Despite the risks of taking on a struggling bank, this acquisition does look very attractive for UBS. It will create a lot of scale in UBS' asset and wealth management business, which will grow to $5 trillion in client assets. UBS also gets Credit Suisse's strong domestic banking unit, which will make it the No. 1 personal and corporate bank in Switzerland.

The deal will increase UBS' tangible book value per share, or net worth, by a whopping 74%. Bank stocks trade relative to this number so this should be very beneficial over the long term.

The deal is expected to start to benefit earnings by 2027 and is expected to generate 8 billion Swiss francs of annual cost savings by 2027. I do think it is worthwhile for Credit Suisse shareholders to keep their UBS shares and hopefully recoup their losses as the franchise gets more valuable over time.",['Bram Berkowitz'],2023-03-20 00:00:00

The former European banking flagship will be bought for the modest sum of $3 billion by its eternal rival and compatriot UBS.

It's a sad end for a giant.

Credit Suisse, a bank born 167 years ago and which has withstood numerous financial crises, has finally given up, struck down by an avalanche of scandals.

The firm is a universal bank, which offers traditional services and products to consumers, mainly in Switzerland. The establishment is known globally for its investment banking activities - trading, mergers and acquisitions, issuance and underwriting of securities, etc. - and wealth management operations.

In recent years, the Credit Suisse had never managed to avoid problems. It was implicated in almost every scandal affecting the global banking industry.

In 2008, the global financial system was on the verge of collapse, shaken by subprime mortgages. At the time, the interdependence of the big banks became apparent. They were all impacted, but while Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, Credit Suisse assessed the cost of its losses at 10 billion Swiss francs. This amount is small, compared to its rivals, in particular UBS, whose losses amounted to 40 billion Swiss francs.

A Decade of Scandals

UBS was bailed out by the Swiss government, while Credit Suisse avoided such humiliation by finding Qatari investors to recapitalize.

A year later, Credit Suisse was fined $536 million for circumventing US sanctions against Iran and Sudan between 1995 and 2006. For the next five years, the bank managed to avoid making negative headlines.

But in 2014, Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to helping wealthy Americans evade taxes. The bank paid a $2.6 billion fine but avoided prosecution. The same year, the name of the firm was also included in the list of banks accused of having manipulated the Libor rate.

Two years later, the ""Tuna bonds"" affair broke out in Mozambique. Credit Suisse employees were accused of making secret loans worth $2 billion for which they allegedly took bribes.

The bank paid $475 million in fines to US and UK authorities in 2021. But there are still ongoing disputes. In 2017, Credit Suisse was fined $5.28 billion for its role in subprime lending in the United States.

A year later, FINMA, the Swiss banking regulator, accused the bank of failing to comply with due diligence obligations in the context of the fight against money laundering linked to Petrobras, PDVSA and FIFA.

The scandals were also internal. In 2019, it was discovered that Credit Suisse had several of its employees and ex-employees followed. This scandal led to the departure of CEO Tidjane Thiam, five years after his arrival.

And then, in 2021, there were the two cases that would ultimately bring down the bank. The bank played too much with fire. This time, it ended up getting burned.

The first was the bankruptcy of Greensill. Founded in 2011, the British company was a supply chain and accounts receivables lender that specialized in lending money to companies so that they could pay their suppliers. It then packaged the debts of these companies into financial securities which it would resell to investors.

The house of cards began to crumble when these investors, including Credit Suisse, had doubts about the real value of the debts and abandoned Greensill, which then filed for bankruptcy in March 2021.

A Descent into Hell

Credit Suisse (CSGKF) had invested $10 billion of its clients' funds in Greensill products.

The second scandal in the spring of 2021 involved family office Archegos Capital Management. Bill Hwang, a South Korean investor based in New York who founded hedge fund Tiger Asia Management in 2001, suffered a major setback in 2012 because of insider trading allegations. Hwang gradually revived Tiger Asia which became Archegos.

While his company would manage $10 billion, Hwang convinced banks, including Credit Suisse, to lend him $30 billion to invest more. In 2020, he invested heavily in ViacomCBS (VIACA) - Get Free Report, which saw the value of its shares soar.

At the beginning of 2021, Credit Suisse asked Archegos to deposit funds. Hwang promised to reduce the risks. But in March 2021, ViacomCBS shares crashed and the banks asked Archegos to cover the losses, which it was no longer able to do. As a result, Hwang's company went bankrupt.

These scandals caused losses in the billions and a stock market rout for Credit Suisse. The price of Credit Suisse shares was around 11.45 Swiss francs at the start of January 2021. Just over two years later, Credit Suisse shares are trading at 1.86 Swiss francs. That's an 84% drop.

The market capitalization of a bank that served the largest fortunes in the world, participated in the largest financial transactions and was a household name in Switzerland, is now worth only 7.33 billion Swiss francs ($8 billion).

A veritable descent into hell for a bank whose market value had risen to an all-time high of $87.76 billion on April 29, 2007.

On Mar. 19, the Swiss authorities announced that Credit Suisse was to be acquired by UBS for just over $3 billion, a modest price that is not even half of its market value.

A sad end for an establishment which employed 50,000 people at the end of 2022.",[],

Credit Suisse was a pillar of Swiss banking that rapidly collapsed, its foundations fatally undercut by repeated missteps that left it shaky when storms in the banking sector began swirling.

One of 30 banks worldwide deemed too big to fail, its share price collapsed on Wednesday and before Sunday was out, its remains were being taken over by domestic rivals UBS.

It had been seen as the weakest link in the chain and blew over like a house of cards once fears of a domino effect began bubbling up after the collapse of two US lenders.

Here is an overview of the woes that brought down Credit Suisse:

The catalogue of troubles began with the 2021 collapse of Greensill, a British financial firm specialised in short-term corporate loans via a complex and opaque business model.

Greensill's collapse threw a number of companies into difficulty -- none more than Credit Suisse, which was particularly heavily invested in the firm.

In March 2021, after Greensill declared insolvency, Credit Suisse closed four connected funds in which around $10 billion had been invested.

Swiss financial regulator FINMA concluded that the bank ""seriously breached its supervisory obligations"" and ordered ""remedial measures.""

Just four weeks after the Greensill collapse, Credit Suisse was rocked by the implosion of US hedge fund Archegos, which cost the bank more than $5 billion.

In October 2021, the bank was fined $475 million by US and British authorities after it was caught up in a bribery scandal in Mozambique involving loans to state-owned companies.

The credits, granted between 2013 and 2016, were supposed to finance maritime surveillance, fishing and shipyard projects, but were partly diverted for bribes.

The bank agreed with the British authorities to cancel the $200 million owed by the southeast African country, which was plunged into a serious financial crisis.

Former Lloyds Banking Group chief Antonio Horta-Osorio was brought in as Credit Suisse chairman in April 2021, pledging to put better risk management at the heart of its culture.

Less than nine months later, he resigned after it emerged he had violated Switzerland's Covid quarantine rules.

A media investigation published in February 2022, dubbed ""Suisse Secrets"", alleged that the bank had held billions of dollars of dirty money for decades.

The probe, coordinated by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, said leaked information on more than 18,000 bank accounts dating back to the 1940s showed Credit Suisse held more than $8 billion in the accounts of criminals, dictators and rights abusers.

The bank rejected the findings, saying they were ""based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context"".

At the end of March 2022, a Bermuda judge ruled that former Georgian prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili had suffered a loss of $553 million due to failures by Credit Suisse Life Bermuda, a Credit Suisse affiliate, to fulfil its fiduciary duty.

The case stemmed from the actions of Patrice Lescaudron, a former star banker at Credit Suisse sentenced by Swiss authorities to five years in prison in 2018 on charges of fraud and forgery. Lescaudron committed suicide in 2020.

The court found that the Credit Suisse affiliate ""was prioritising the revenues Mr Lescaudron generated for Credit Suisse over the interests of its clients"".

In June 2022, Credit Suisse was slapped with a $2 million fine in a money laundering case linked to a Bulgarian cocaine network.

Switzerland's Federal Criminal Court ruled that the bank had failed to take steps to prevent money laundering by the criminal organisation, deeming it guilty of breaching its corporate responsibility in a case dating back to 2007 and 2008.

In October 2022, Credit Suisse said it would pay $495 million to settle a row with the US state of New Jersey over mortgage-backed securities dating back to the 2008 financial crisis.

In France that same month, it agreed to pay 238 million euros to avoid prosecution on money laundering and tax fraud charges brought in 2016 over undeclared accounts held by French nationals.

Credit Suisse was forced to postpone its annual report, which had been scheduled to be published last week, after a last-minute call from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over revisions made to cash-flow statements for 2019 and 2020.

When it finally released the report on Tuesday, it acknowledged ""material weaknesses"" in its internal controls.

Following fears of contagion from the collapse of two US banks, comments from Credit Suisse's main shareholder Wednesday that it would not invest more money in the bank sparked market panic.

Deutsche Bank underwent a multibillion-euro restructure in recent years aimed at reducing costs and improving profitability. The lender recorded annual net income of 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) in 2022, up 159% from the previous year. Its CET1 ratio — a measure of bank solvency — came in at 13.4% at the end of 2022, while its liquidity coverage ratio was 142% and its net stable funding ratio stood at 119%. These figures would not indicate that there is any cause for concern about the bank's solvency or liquidity position. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told a news conference in Brussels on Friday that Deutsche Bank had ""thoroughly reorganized and modernized its business model and is a very profitable bank,"" adding that there is no basis to speculate about its future. 'Just not very scary' Some of the concerns around Deutsche Bank have centered on its U.S. commercial real estate exposures and substantial derivatives book. However, research firm Autonomous, a subsidiary of AllianceBernstein, on Friday dismissed these concerns as both ""well known"" and ""just not very scary,"" pointing to the bank's ""robust capital and liquidity positions."" ""Our Underperform rating on the stock is simply driven by our view that there are more attractive equity stories elsewhere in the sector (i.e. relative value),"" Autonomous strategists Stuart Graham and Leona Li said in a research note. ""We have no concerns about Deutsche's viability or asset marks. To be crystal clear - Deutsche is NOT the next Credit Suisse."" Unlike the stricken Swiss lender, they highlighted that Deutsche is ""solidly profitable,"" and Autonomous forecasts a return on tangible book value of 7.1% for 2023, rising to 8.5% by 2025. 'Fresh and intense focus' on liquidity Credit Suisse's collapse boiled down to a combination of three causes, according to JPMorgan. These were a ""string of governance failures that had eroded confidence in management's abilities,"" a challenging market backdrop that hampered the bank's restructuring plan, and the market's ""fresh and intense focus on liquidity risk"" in the wake of the SVB collapse. While the latter proved to be the final trigger, the Wall Street bank argued that the importance of the environment in which Credit Suisse was trying to overhaul its business model could not be understated, as illustrated by a comparison with Deutsche. ""The German bank had its own share of headline pressure and governance fumbles, and in our view had a far lower quality franchise to begin with, which while significantly less levered today, still commands a relatively elevated cost base and has relied on its FICC (fixed income, currencies and commodities) trading franchise for organic capital generation and credit re-rating,"" JPMorgan strategists said in a note Friday.

""By comparison, although Credit Suisse clearly has shared the struggles of running a cost and capital intensive IB [investment bank], for the longest time it still had up its sleeve both a high-quality Asset and Wealth Management franchise, and a profitable Swiss Bank; all of which was well capitalised from both a RWA [risk-weighted asset] and Leverage exposure standpoint."" They added that whatever the quality of the franchise, the events of recent months had proven that such institutions ""rely entirely on trust."" ""Where Deutsche's governance fumbles could not incrementally 'cost' the bank anything in franchise loss, Credit Suisse's were immediately punished with investor outflows in the Wealth Management division, causing what should have been seen as the bank's 'crown jewel' to themselves deepen the bank's P&L losses,"" they noted. At the time of SVB's collapse, Credit Suisse was already in the spotlight over its liquidity position and had suffered massive outflows in the fourth quarter of 2022 that had yet to reverse.

https://news.yahoo.com/credit-suisse-customers-feel-mix-140727708.html,"Credit Suisse customers feel mix of anger, relief after sale","GENEVA (AP) — Fury at top Credit Suisse managers. Lament over damage to Switzerland's image as a stable, reliable banking center. Relief that authorities stepped in to help protect deposits, but worry about keeping cash invested in a bank that failed to manage its own money adequately.

On Swiss streets, emotions were running the gamut among Credit Suisse customers after the government this weekend orchestrated a takeover of the country's second-largest bank by rival UBS — a bid to prevent further upheaval in the global financial system that began with the collapse of two U.S. banks.

How the merger, with a fire-sale price of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion), will play out and its impact on worldwide finance are largely unknown. That has left those stuck in the middle — customers and bank workers — uncertain about what comes next in the deal to create one Swiss megabank.

“My money is already invested in two or three banking establishments,” customer Elisabeth Pictet said after exiting the biggest Credit Suisse branch in central Geneva. ""I am not a millionaire, but it is true that in the long run maybe I will even more favor local, regional banking establishments.”

Pictet — whose husband hails from a legendary banking family in Switzerland — said she's not gotten any communication from the bank about how to proceed but praised the government for a “wise decision” that reassured many Swiss residents like her. She said Tuesday that she's had no trouble withdrawing cash.

“I feel a lot of anger at Credit Suisse managers because in the end, their employees will lose their jobs — many employees who did their work professionally,"" said Pictet, 59, who is transitioning into retirement from a health care job. “Now, we'll only have a single big bank — UBS — and that is not good: It's good to have competition, and we won't have that anymore.”

Asked if Credit Suisse had told customers how to manage their assets since the deal emerged Sunday, a bank spokeswoman said that “until the transaction has closed, business continues as usual for Credit Suisse and its clients.”

Story continues

That likely won't be the case for Credit Suisse's 50,000 workers, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland, as the two banks combine. The Swiss bank employee’s association is demanding that job losses be held to a minimum, that no layoffs happen until year's end, and the government provide an unspecified jobs guarantee.

“It is impermissible that the companies are secured by tax dollars but the employees come away with nothing,"" the group said in a prepared statement. ""The billions in guarantees from the federal government must be linked to conditions favorable to the employees.”

The impact of the merger is extensive. Many of Switzerland's 8.5 million people have accounts in either UBS or Credit Suisse.

“I myself am grateful as a customer that this worked out,” said Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter at a news conference Sunday to announce the hastily arranged deal.

She said she has accounts at both banks.

“I think what we have done now is really to protect those people who have money at Credit Suisse,"" Keller-Sutter said, with small- and medium-size companies able to keep paying their workers, carry out transactions and access their savings.

Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas LLC, agreed that Credit Suisse depositors need not worry about their money now — though he noted reports of snap withdrawals worth billions of dollars last week amid confusion about the bank's future.

The Swiss central bank and government have since guaranteed loans to the combined bank worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

“Basically, the Swiss National Bank has stepped in and said, ‘Your deposits are safe,'"" said Marenzi, whose firm focuses on capital markets.

Bank runs are a risk for even the biggest and safest banks, but ""with Credit Suisse, things look very, very safe indeed at this stage in terms of deposits. So I wouldn’t be in a rush to move money out of there,” he said.

It's a different story for those who entrusted their money to Credit Suisse for wealth management or investment advice.

“Those customers are scratching their heads and saying, ‘Well, if you can’t manage your own money, why would you be able to manage mine?’ And that’s a fair question,” Marenzi said.

Swiss regulators and officials, reportedly under intense pressure from other Western governments and ultra-rich investors, forged the Credit Suisse takeover by UBS in a bid to stop more banking-sector turmoil.

Credit Suisse's problems — ranging from big losses on hedge fund bets to a spying scandal and failing to prevent money laundering by a Bulgarian cocaine ring — predated the recent collapse of U.S. banks but drew fears about its vulnerability.

For some in Geneva, there was sentimentality about the looming disappearance of a storied Swiss bank whose origins date to the budding railroad industry in the mid-19th century.

Credit Suisse customer Mokhtar Zada, 78, a retired former financial-sector worker originally from Afghanistan, said the demise of Credit Suisse wouldn't affect him because he too has an account at UBS and could just transfer money to it if necessary.

“But what a waste,"" said Zada, clutching a Credit Suisse savings booklet that he first received in 1965 and had shown as a sort of souvenir to bank employees. “It’s really too bad that a bank with 170-odd years of history is going to vanish just like that.”

Courtney Bonnell reported from London.","['Jamey Keaten', 'Courtney Bonnell']",
https://www.newsday.com/business/credit-suisse-federal-council-ubs-e7ou8pv2,"UBS acquiring smaller, troubled rival Credit Suisse for nearly $3.25B","GENEVA — Banking giant UBS is buying troubled rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion, in a deal orchestrated by regulators in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in the global banking system.

Swiss authorities pushed for UBS to take over its smaller rival after a plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and the bank’s customers. Shares of Credit Suisse and other banks sold off this week after the failure of two banks in the U.S. sparked concerns about other potentially shaky institutions in the global financial system.

Credit Suisse is among the 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

The deal was “one of great breadth for the stability of international finance,"" said Swiss President Alain Berset as he announced the deal Sunday night. ""An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.”

The Swiss Federal Council, a seven-member governing body that includes Berset, passed an emergency ordinance allowing the merger to go through without the approval of shareholders.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann called the deal “a clear turning point.”

“It is a historic, sad and very challenging day for Credit Suisse, for Switzerland and for the global financial markets,” Lehmann said, adding that the focus is now on the future and in particular on the 50,000 Credit Suisse employees, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland.

Colm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed the “enormous opportunities” that emerge from the takeover, and highlighted his bank’s “conservative risk culture” — a subtle swipe at a Credit Suisse culture that’s known for more swashbuckling, aggressive gambles on bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said the council ""regrets that the bank, which was once a model institution in Switzerland and part of our strong location, was able to get into this situation at all.”

The combination of the two biggest and best-known Swiss banks, each with storied histories dating to the mid-19th century, amounts to a thunderclap for Switzerland’s reputation as a global financial center — leaving it on the cusp of having a single national champion in banking.

The deal follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further bank panics. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse’s share price began plummeting this week.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde lauded the “swift action” by Swiss officials, saying they were “instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.”

She said the banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.

While UBS is buying Credit Suisse, UBS officials said they plan to sell off parts of it or reduce the size of the bank in the coming months and years.

The Swiss government is providing more than 100 billion francs in aid and financial backstops to make the deal go through.

A part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out. European bank regulators use a special type of bond designed to provide a capital cushion to banks in times of distress. But these bonds are designed to be wiped out if a bank’s capital falls below a certain level, which was triggered as part of this government-brokered deal.

Berset said the Federal Council had already been discussing a long-troubled situation at Credit Suisse since the beginning of the year and held urgent meetings in the last four days amid spiraling concerns about its financial health that caused major swoons in its stock price and raised the specter of the 2007-08 financial crisis.

Investors and banking industry analysts we`re still digesting the deal, but one analyst was sour on the news due to the reputational damage the deal might have on Switzerland’s global banking image.

“A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,” said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas LLC, in an email.

Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

The Credit Suisse parent bank is not part of European Union supervision, but it has entities in several European countries that are. Lagarde reiterated what she said last week after the central bank raised interest rates — that the European banking sector is resilient, with strong financial reserves and plenty of ready cash.

Many of Credit Suisse’s problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.

The deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn't invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.

On Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.

Its current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.

While smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.

UBS is officially buying Credit Suisse in an effort to prevent the bank's collapse, the Swiss National Bank announced Sunday.

UBS and Credit Suisse each confirmed the deal in press statements released later Sunday. Credit Suisse said the deal would value the bank at Sfr3 billion, or around $3.25 billion.

""Credit Suisse and UBS have entered into a merger agreement on Sunday with UBS being the surviving entity,"" Credit Suisse said in its statement. ""After negotiations that took place during the weekend leading up to the signing of the merger agreement, UBS and Credit Suisse concluded that it would be in the best interest of their shareholders and their stakeholders to enter into the merger.""

The merger comes after shares of Credit Suisse tumbled to a record low this week and fears mounted over the strength of the global banking system. The Financial Times reported earlier on Sunday that UBS said it would pay $2 billion to buy rival Credit Suisse, doubling its initial $1 billion offer, before finally settling at $3.25 billion.

The deal is significantly less than the bank's market value of $9.5 billion. Credit Suisse pushed back on the initial offers on Sunday, saying they were too low and would hurt shareholders, sources told Bloomberg.

""This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue,"" UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said in a statement.

The deal between Switzerland's two biggest banks was brokered by the Swiss National Bank and regulators in an effort to shore up confidence for the country's financial institutions, the Financial Times reported on Friday.

According to the outlet, Swiss regulators said a merger between the two banks was their ""plan A"" leading into markets opening Monday. The FT reported that Switzerland is using emergency measures to fast-track the deal and bypass the usual six-week consultation period for shareholders.

Deutsche Bank also reportedly considered acquiring parts of Credit Suisse, sources close to the matter told Bloomberg on Saturday.

Here's a closer look at the European lender's troubles, and why it's faced doubts about its stability.

Why is Credit Suisse under fire right now?

Credit Suisse shares tanked Wednesday after its biggest shareholder, Saudi National Bank, warned it wouldn't be able to invest more cash without raising its stake above the regulatory limit of 10%.

SNB's chair, Ammar al-Khudairy, told Reuters that he doesn't see the Saudi bank's stated lack of support as a problem.

""I don't think they will need extra money; if you look at their ratios, they're fine,"" he said, referring to standard measures of a bank's financial health.

""We are happy with the plan, the transformation plan that they have put forward. It is a very strong bank,"" he added, noting Credit Suisse operates under a strong regulatory regime in Switzerland and other countries.

But investors have been showing signs of losing faith in Credit Suisse long before the Saudi comments, and before the SVB collapse rattled the entire banking industry.

Harris Associates, Credit Suisse's No. 1 investor as recently as last year, exited its entire stake in the embattled Swiss bank over the past few months. The Chicago-based investment management firm owned about 10% of the Swiss bank's stock as of August last year, but slashed its exposure to 5% in January. More recently, Harris reportedly cut its holdings in the lender to zero.

""There is a question about the future of the franchise. There have been large outflows from wealth management,"" David Herro, Harris Associates' deputy chairman and chief investment officer, was cited by the Financial Times as saying, in a March 5 report.

And Credit Suisse has faced a slew of other recent challenges. The bank revealed in its latest annual report that it found ""material weaknesses"" in its internal control over its financial reporting. Moreover, it delayed publishing that annual report after the Securities and Exchange Commission inquired about the lender's revisions to cash flow statements dating back to 2019.

Credit Suisse also suffered a net loss of about $8 billion last year, as its net revenues tanked by more than a third.

Moreover, it has seen a sharp increase in outflows over the past few months, driving it to tap its ""liquidity buffers"" — liquid assets such as central-bank reserves and high-quality government debt.

Here's a quick summary of the controversies that have plagued Credit Suisse in recent years:

The bank hired private detectives to spy on former executives, leading to the departure of its CEO in February 2020.

It lost nearly $6 billion in March 2021 after Archeges Capital Management imploded and defaulted on its loans from the Swiss lender.

It's still working to recover about $2 billion of the roughly $10 billion it had tied up in supply chain finance funds linked to Greensill, which collapsed amid allegations of fraud in March 2021.

It was fined for making fraudulent loans dubbed ""tuna bonds"" to Mozambique's government between 2012 and 2016.

Its chairman was forced to resign in January after an internal investigation found he violated COVID-19 quarantine rules to attend Wimbledon.

Credit Suisse's previous CEO resigned for personal and health reasons last July.

Is a banking crisis brewing?

The race to put together a deal to acquire Credit Suisse follow recent events in the US banking industry.

Silvergate, a key lender to the cryptocurrency industry, announced it was winding down its operations and liquidating its assets last Wednesday.

Silicon Valley Bank, a major player in the venture-capital ecosystem, was overwhelmed by a wave of withdrawals and taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) on March 10.

The FDIC revealed on March 12 it had taken control of Signature Bank as well. Moreover, it announced that under a ""systemic risk exception,"" it would fully guarantee both banks' deposits, beyond the usual limit of $250,000 per account.

And First Republic Bank has also been trying to stave off concerns about its financial position, with 11 banks depositing $30 billion in the bank to help shore up its liquidity. Still, the New York Times reported on Friday that First Republic was looking to raise fresh capital.

SVB ran into trouble because it invested some of its clients' deposits in long-dated bonds. Those plunged in price as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates from nearly zero to upwards of 4.5% over the past 12 months in response to inflation hitting 40-year highs.

The lender sold its bond portfolio at a nearly $2 billion loss last week, and launched a capital raise to reinforce its finances. Its scramble for cash stoked concerns about SVB's stability among VCs and their portfolio companies, sparking a wave of withdrawals that overwhelmed the bank and spurred the FDIC to intervene.

SVB's collapse fueled worries that other banks are carrying heavy losses on their bond portfolios, as rates have jumped in both the US and Europe.

It also put a focus on bank liquidity, with consumers and companies shifting their deposits from weaker banks to the strongest and largest institutions.","['Theron Mohamed', 'Bethany Biron']",2023-03-19 00:00:00

CREDIT SUISSE FACES LAWSUITS FROM US SHAREHOLDERS FOR ALLEGEDLY CONCEALING FINANCIAL WOES

Regulators faced a sense of urgency to push the deal through on Sunday before markets opened Monday as the specter of Credit Suisse potentially failing next week loomed over the negotiations. Credit Suisse, which has been in business for 167 years, is one of 30 globally systemically important banks, which heightened worries about how global financial markets would react to its implosion.

Talk about the UBS acquisition heated up over the weekend and involved the Swiss government's financial regulators giving it the green light after the sides came to an agreement over the more complex terms of the deal.

The deal involves a large amount of public support, with three tranches of liquidity and loans, as well as a pledge from the Swiss government to absorb up to 9 billion francs in potential losses from the takeover.

The total of 259 billion francs of support is equivalent to a third of Switzerland's entire economic output, which stood at 771 billion francs last year.

""The government's going to have to say to voters why they are putting citizens' money, taxpayer money at risk to bail out a bank that was predominantly servicing the ultra wealthy, doing some pretty extraordinary things with its investment bank and paying people crazy amounts of money relative to what the man in the street gets paid,"" one former global bank CEO, who did not wish to be identified, told Reuters.

Both banks have access to existing lending facilities and may obtain an additional loan of up to 100 billion francs (or about $108 billion), while Credit Suisse can also tap a second liquidity assistance loan of that size that's backstopped by the Swiss federal government.

""The substantial provision of liquidity will ensure that both banks have access to the necessary liquidity,"" the Swiss National Bank announced in a release. ""By providing substantial liquidity assistance, the SNB is fulfilling its mandate to contribute to the stability of the financial system, and it continues to work closely with the federal government and FINMA to this end.""

As a large global financial institution, Credit Suisse has an investment banking arm that it has tried to spin off in recent years, in addition to a local retail bank. UBS' acquisition of those divisions of Credit Suisse, in whole or in part, could create additional regulatory complexity for the firm given its own activities in those areas.

Layoffs are likely as Credit Suisse had previously pledged to cut 9,000 jobs as part of its restructuring, and the bank has investment and local banking divisions that overlap with UBS' operations.

However, in a memo seen by Reuters that was sent to staff on Sunday after the deal announcement, Credit Suisse reassured staff that their bonuses would be paid in full.

Bloomberg reported that Credit Suisse balked at UBS’ initial offer of $1 billion and argued that it fell well short of the firm’s valuation, which stood at about $9.5 billion as of Friday, and that it would harm the bank’s employees and shareholders. The size of UBS’ offer was first reported by the Financial Times.

UBS has a balance sheet of about $1.1 trillion – roughly twice the size of Credit Suisse – and has been more resilient than Credit Suisse in the years since the global financial crisis of 2008.

Credit Suisse’s distressed financial position arose from billions of dollars in losses from investments gone awry and fines imposed by regulators. Its assets dropped from $1.2 trillion in the third quarter of 2008 to $576 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022.

It’s currently facing class-action lawsuits from U.S. shareholders who allege that the company’s leadership made false and misleading statements about the status of depositors’ outflows last year.

The lawsuits also allege the bank's executives failed to make a timely disclosure of material weaknesses in the firm’s internal financial controls that made them ""not effective"" in 2021 and 2022 as revealed in the bank's latest annual report.

Credit Suisse received a liquidity lifeline from the Swiss National Bank this week after its share price plunged to an all-time low, but the embattled lender's path to the brink has been a long and tumultuous one. The announcement that Credit Suisse would borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the central bank came after consecutive sessions of steep drops in its share price. It made Credit Suisse the first major bank to receive such an intervention since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The bank's shares ended Wednesday at 1.697 Swiss francs — down almost 98% from the stock's all-time high in April 2007, while credit default swaps, which insure bondholders against a company defaulting, soared to new record highs this week. It comes after years of investment banking underperformance and a litany of scandals and risk management failures. Scandals Credit Suisse is currently undergoing a massive strategic overhaul in a bid to address these chronic issues. Current CEO and Credit Suisse veteran Ulrich Koerner took over from Thomas Gottstein in July, as poor investment bank performance and mounting litigation provisions continued to hammer earnings. Gottstein took the reins in early 2020 following the resignation of predecessor Tidjane Thiam in the wake of a bizarre spying scandal, in which UBS-bound former wealth management boss Iqbal Khan was tailed by private contractors allegedly at the direction of former COO Pierre-Olivier Bouee. The saga also saw the suicide of a private investigator and the resignations of a slew of executives.

The former head of Credit Suisse's flagship domestic bank widely perceived as a steady hand, Gottstein sought to lay to rest an era plagued by scandal. That mission was short-lived. In early 2021, he found himself dealing with the fallout from two huge crises. The bank's exposure to the collapses of U.S. family hedge fund Archegos Capital and British supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital saddled it with massive litigation and reimbursement costs. These oversight failures resulted in a massive shakeup of Credit Suisse's investment banking, risk and compliance and asset management divisions. In April 2021, former Lloyds Banking Group CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio was brought in to clean up the bank's culture after the string of scandals, announcing a new strategy in November. But in January 2022, Horta-Osorio was forced to resign after being found to have twice violated Covid-19 quarantine rules. He was replaced by UBS executive Axel Lehmann.

In February 2022, the bank faced fresh scrutiny after leaked data purported to show it had served human rights abusers, corrupt politicians and sanctioned businessmen for decades. Legacy compliance skeletons also continued to emerge from the closet. In June 2022, Credit Suisse was found guilty in Switzerland's Federal Criminal Court of failing to prevent an alleged Bulgarian cocaine trafficking gang from laundering profits via the bank between 2004 and 2008. With litigation provisions mounting and performance still trailing its peers, the losses deepened in both the company's earnings and its share price. After a 1.593 billion Swiss franc loss in the second quarter of 2022, and two months after Lehmann staunchly denied talks of a change in leadership, Credit Suisse announced that Gottstein would be replaced with Koerner.

watch now

The bank began another costly sweeping transformation project as Koerner and Lehmann set out to return the embattled lender to long-term stability and profitability. This included the spin-off of Credit Suisse's investment banking division to form U.S.-based CS First Boston, a significant cut in exposure to risk-weighted assets and a $4.2 billion capital raise, which saw the Saudi National Bank take a 9.9% stake to become the largest shareholder. March madness Credit Suisse reported a full-year net loss of 7.3 billion Swiss francs for 2022, predicting another ""substantial"" loss in 2023 before returning to profitability in 2024. Reports of liquidity concerns late in the year led to huge outflows of assets under management, which hit 110.5 billion Swiss francs in the fourth quarter. After yet another sharp share price fall on the back of its annual results in early February, Credit Suisse shares entered March 2023 trading at a paltry 2.85 Swiss francs per share, but things were about to get worse still.

watch now

On March 9, the company was forced to delay its 2022 annual report after a late call from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission relating to a ""technical assessment of previously disclosed revisions to the consolidated cash flow statements"" in 2019 and 2020. The report was eventually published the following Tuesday, and Credit Suisse noted that ""material weaknesses"" were found in its financial reporting processes for 2021 and 2022, though it confirmed that its previously announced financial statements were still accurate. Having already suffered the global risk-off jolt resulting from the collapse of U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank, the combination of these remarks and confirmation that outflows had not reversed compounded Credit Suisse's share price losses. And on Wednesday, it went into freefall, as top investor the Saudi National Bank said it was not able to provide any more cash to Credit Suisse due to regulatory restrictions. Despite the SNB clarifying that it still believed in the transformation project, shares dived 24% to an all-time low.

https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/ubs-brings-back-ermotti-ceo-credit-suisse-deal-98198739,UBS brings back Ermotti as CEO with Credit Suisse deal ahead,"UBS says it’s bringing back former CEO Sergio Ermotti to lead the Swiss bank as it moves forward with a government-orchestrated plan to take over struggling rival Credit Suisse

GENEVA -- UBS said Wednesday that it's bringing back former CEO Sergio Ermotti to lead the Swiss bank as it executes a government-orchestrated plan to take over struggling rival Credit Suisse.

Ermotti, who was the bank's top executive for nine years and led a turnaround following the 2008 global financial crisis, will take over next Wednesday from CEO Ralph Hamers.

Hamers took up the job in November 2020 and will remain at UBS during a transition period “to ensure a successful closure of the transaction and a smooth handover,” the bank said in a statement.

“Whilst Ralph was capable of doing the job, we felt that Sergio was better suited to navigating these things,” Chairman Colm Kelleher said on a conference call, alluding to the UBS board decision. “I cannot reemphasize how big this deal is in terms of financial history and financial engineering that’s required.”

UBS credited Ermotti, who is now chairman of insurer Swiss Re, for having “cut its footprint” and changing the culture of the bank — and it pointed to his experience in bringing big financial institutions together.

Ermotti, who hails from the southern, mostly Italian-speaking Swiss region of Ticino, acknowledged that “coming back to manage this situation is a challenge” but felt “a sense of call-of-duty aspect” to return.

Plus, he said he had contemplated a tie-up like the one with Credit Suisse while previously in the top job, and it would be a bit of a ”contradiction"" for him not to accept the post ""to basically execute on what I believe was the right next move for UBS.”

Kelleher said he called Ermotti “to explore the possibility of this” a day after the emergency takeover deal was settled on March 19, which involved Swiss regulators, the federal government and top executives at both banks.

“This is is the biggest single financial transaction since 2008. That brings significant execution risk,” Kelleher said.

The hastily arranged, $3.25 billion deal for Credit Suisse aimed to stem the upheaval in the global financial system after the collapse of two U.S. banks and jitters about long-running troubles at Credit Suisse led shares of Switzerland’s second-largest bank to tank and customers to pull out their money.

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after the central bank’s plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and customers. The Swiss executive branch passed emergency measures to bypass shareholder approval.

Uncertainties still lie ahead, including a U.S. Senate committee report released Wednesday that says Credit Suisse violated a plea agreement with U.S. authorities by failing to report secret offshore accounts that wealthy Americans used to avoid paying taxes.

UBS said it assessed outstanding lawsuits and investigations as part of the Credit Suisse acquisition and expects the deal to be beneficial for shareholders. It says it's working to close the sale and get approval from regulators in the coming weeks or months.

Hamers, the outgoing CEO, said UBS executives want to ensure “a digestible transaction” in terms of risk. He said there were plans to “manage down the investment bank” at Credit Suisse because many of the activities were not central for UBS.

UBS leaders announced no immediate plan about job cuts linked to the deal.

Swiss lawmakers and academics have raised concerns that the deal could create an unwieldy Swiss banking behemoth, while UBS executives said regulatory issues loom internationally before the deal can close.

Ermotti suggested he didn't view “too big too fail” concerns as a problem.

“I do think that scale and size is not a problem if it is focused and well-managed,” he said. “For me, the debate nowadays is not ‘too big to fail' but ‘too small to survive’ — and we want to be a winner.”

Many Credit Suisse customers have expressed regret at the looming disappearance of a 167-year-old bank that has been a pillar of Switzerland's renowned banking and financial industry.

The Swiss government and other global authorities, including some from the US, are working toward sealing the agreement on Sunday in the hopes of shoring up trust in the banking system before the markets open Monday.

The scramble to get the deal done is playing out after the Swiss National Bank and the country’s top regulator, Finma, told their international counterparts they regard a deal with UBS as the only option to stop Credit Suisse from collapsing, the Financial Times reported.

It will be the first combination of two global systemically important banks since the financial crisis of 2008-2009, according to Bloomberg News.

A full merger would create one of the largest financial institutions in Europe.

Switzerland is preparing to use emergency measures to fast-track the deal, the FT said.

The country’s regulators have offered to waive rules that ordinarily require six weeks’ notification and shareholder votes on a takeover, in order to make the sale happen quickly.

The 167-year-old Credit Suisse got more than $50 billion from the Swiss National Bank this week as worries mounted about its solvency, following the shock to the banking system generated by the collapse of the California-based Silicon Valley Bank.

But that infusion didn’t stop investors from selling off the bank’s stock, or slow down depositors who were pulling their money out of accounts at a rate of $10.8 billion per day, the FT reported.

The ongoing panic forced the Swiss National Bank and the country’s financial regulator to organize the weekend’s talks on the potential takeover by UBS, which with $1.1 trillion in assets is about twice the size of Credit Suisse, the Wall Street Journal reported.

UBS is asking the Swiss government to cover about $6 billion in costs related to a potential takeover, Reuters reported. That would cover both expenses associated with winding down some of the ailing bank’s operations and legal bills.

Exactly how the sale will be worked out is still up in the air. It’s possible UBS could take over all of Credit Suisse, but reports said the fate of its huge retail bank is one question — and its troubled investment bank is another.

UBS, which reported a 2022 profit of $7.6 billion, is likely to win Credit Suisse’s wealth management business, which will come with high-priced clients in Asia and the Middle East.

Credit Suisse posted a loss of $7.9 billion last year.

Credit Suisse had around 50,000 employees at the end of 2022, including more than 16,000 in Switzerland.

Its global operations include an investment banking unit in New York and an operations hub near Raleigh, North Carolina.

UBS has around 74,000 employees worldwide.

Up to 10,000 jobs may be eliminated if the two banks combine, but it was unclear which divisions of the banks might be hit by any cuts.

Credit Suisse announced a plan to cut 9,000 jobs last year as it struggled to reorganize.

It’s still possible the deal may not go through, and other financial players are also reportedly in the mix, the Journal reported.

ZURICH, March 15 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse shares slumped by as much as 30% on Wednesday after its largest shareholder said it could not provide further support, prompting the Swiss bank's CEO to make new assurances on its financial strength.

Saudi National Bank (SNB) (1180.SE), which holds 9.88% of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), said it would not buy more shares on regulatory grounds.

Shares in Credit Suisse, which is battling to recover from a string of scandals that have undermined the confidence of investors and clients, were down about 17% in early afternoon trading, after shedding as much as 30% to a new record low.

In a sign that regulatory authorities are tracking developments, European Central Bank (ECB) officials contacted lenders it supervises to ask about financial exposures to Credit Suisse, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, confirming a Wall Street Journal report.

Meanwhile, the falls in Credit Suisse's market value also prompted action among politicians with French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne saying that Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire would speak with his Swiss counterpart in the coming hours.

""The Credit Suisse situation is for the Swiss authorities to deal with,"" Borne said in the French Senate.

Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Koerner moved to calm nerves, saying the bank's liquidity base remained strong and was well above all regulatory requirements. Koerner had said earlier in the week Credit Suisse's liquidity coverage ratio averaged 150% in the first quarter of this year.

The Swiss National Bank declined to comment on the fall in shares Credit Suisse shares.

Credit Suisse on Tuesday published its annual report for 2022, which said it had identified ""material weaknesses"" in controls over financial reporting and had not yet stemmed customer outflow.

Switzerland's second-biggest bank had seen fourth quarter customer outflows rise to more than 110 billion Swiss francs ($120 billion).

Exane analysts said they saw a bailout by the Swiss National Bank and financial regulator Finma, possibly with one or more other banks, as the ""most likely scenario"" facing Credit Suisse.

They also raised the possibility of a u-turn by Saudi National Bank, which upped its stake in Credit Suisse last year as part of a capital raise to bolster its financial strength.

""We cannot because we would go above 10%. It’s a regulatory issue,"" SNB Chairman Ammar Al Khudairy told Reuters on Wednesday.

'GAME-CHANGING'

Credit Suisse's plunging stock price has re-ignited jitters among investors about the resilience of the global banking system after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last week.

""There has to be some kind of game-changing decisive action to reverse and stabilise the situation,"" Exane's analysts said.

Among the biggest decliners in European banks on Wednesday were French lenders Societe Generale (SOGN.PA), down 12%, and BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), which fell by 9%.

Ralph Hamers, CEO of Swiss rival UBS (UBSG.S), speaking at a Morgan Stanley conference on Wednesday, said UBS had benefited from recent market turmoil and seen money inflows.

""In the last couple of days as you might expect we've seen inflows,"" Hamers said. ""It is clearly a flight to safety from that perspective, but I think three days don't make a trend.""

The cost of insuring the company's bonds against default shot up. Five-year credit default swaps on Credit Suisse debt widened to 574 basis points from 549 bps at last close, based on data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, a new record high.

https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/03/22/ubs-acquisition-credit-suisse-pay-off-shareholders/,Will UBS' Acquisition of Credit Suisse Pay Off for Shareholders?,"In a deal heavily pushed by Swiss and global banking regulators, the large Swiss bank UBS (UBS 1.29%) recently announced that it will acquire the embattled Credit Suisse (CS 1.05%) in an all-stock transaction valued at roughly $3.24 billion.

Credit Suisse has struggled immensely for the last several years and had hoped to transform itself. But given more struggles last week, significant turbulence in the banking sector, and a threat to Switzerland's economy (and perhaps Europe's as well if the bank went under), global banking regulators pushed a deal through over the weekend.

The credit rating agency S&P Global cut UBS' outlook to ""negative"" upon the announcement of the deal, citing ""material execution risk in integrating CS into UBS."" Will this deal be problematic or pay off for shareholders? Let's take a look.

Downside risk protection

The big problem that has surrounded Credit Suisse for years is the firm's investment bank, which clearly has struggled to implement proper risk management protocols. Credit Suisse has racked up billions in losses after certain businesses in the investment bank had outsize exposure to funds like Greensill Capital and Archegos Capital, which both collapsed.

Prior to UBS' acquisition, Credit Suisse had planned to break up its investment bank into three different pieces, one of which was meant to shelter riskier assets. So the biggest risk UBS faces is winding down Credit Suisse's trading business. This deal was obviously pushed through very quickly, given the potential risk of Credit Suisse collapsing, so UBS clearly hasn't had the time to do proper due diligence and there could be other unsavory surprises lurking.

The good news is that UBS secured significant downside protection from Swiss banking regulators of close to $27 billion, which will be used to cover charges, purchase price adjustments, and restructuring costs. Notably -- and quite controversially, I might add -- about $17 billion of this amount will be used to write off additional Tier 1 bank debt, which bondholders were not pleased with given they are supposed to get paid before owners of common stock. Swiss regulators will also provide roughly $9.7 billion of protection against losses in Credit Suisse's investment bank beyond the first $5.4 billion of losses, which UBS will cover.

Enhancing the UBS franchise

Aside from the downside protection, UBS is also acquiring some very good businesses from Credit Suisse, which will help the bank add scale and improve its existing operations.

Credit Suisse's asset and wealth management division has $1 trillion in client assets and brings UBS' total client assets to $5 trillion, putting the latter well on its way toward its $6 trillion goal laid out at its investor day a year ago. UBS will become the second-largest player in global wealth management and the No. 3 ranked asset manager in Europe. These businesses, which are very attractive these days due to the fact that they are less capital intensive, thrive off of scale, and shareholders tend to reward them with higher valuations, too.

UBS will also get Credit Suisse's domestic banking unit, making it the No. 1 corporate and personal bank in Switzerland, with the largest amount of deposits and loans. Bank of America analyst Alastair Ryan wrote in a research note that the pro forma institution will control a roughly 30% market share of Swiss domestic deposits. In 2022, Credit Suisse's Swiss bank reported an 11.8% return on capital, while the asset and wealth management businesses are also capable of putting up strong returns, especially with the enhanced scale at UBS.

The potential to be a great deal

Because the deal was orchestrated so quickly, there is of course execution risk and the possibility that UBS runs into obstacles as it winds down Credit Suisse's investment bank.

But UBS got a great deal. Last week, Credit Suisse was valued at about $8 billion while trading at all-time lows. UBS scooped the bank up for $3.24 billion while securing significant downside protection. The deal also increases UBS' tangible book value per share by a whopping 74%. Bank stocks trade relative to their tangible book value per share, so increasing it tends to be beneficial in the long term.

March 20 (UPI) -- The $3.2 billion rescue takeover of troubled Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse by rival UBS sent the shares of both banks tumbling Monday morning, initially pulling the wider market down with them. Credit Suisse shares were down more than 60% from Friday's close while UBS' were down 5% on the revelation that the deal will see Credit Suisse investors take a massive haircut on their investment, receiving just one UBS share for every 22.48 shares they hold in Credit Suisse.

Credit Suisse and UBS shares led an opening rout of European markets that saw the continent's banking index lose 2% with the shares of major lenders Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas immediately diving 10% and 8% respectively while ING and Barclays shed around 4% of their value.

Mid-morning saw a slight recovery with Deutsche Bank clawing back some of its losses but still down 4%, while BNP Paribas was down 3%.

Asian markets were also hit with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index ending Monday down 2.65% at 19,000 while the Nikkei 225 shed 1.42% to end the session at 26,945.

Among the casualties was Saudi National Bank which confirmed to CNBC that it had suffered a loss of around 80% of its $1.5 billion investment in Credit Suisse -- although its shares shrugged off the news, gaining 2.1%.

Saudi National Bank, which holds a 9.9% stake in Credit Suisse triggered a stock free-fall for the Swiss bank last week after Saudi National Bank Chairman Ammar Al Khudairy said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday that it could not increase its holding because of banking rules.

In a statement Monday, Saudi National Bank said its losses over Credit Suisse would ""have no impact"" on its growth plans and 2023 guidance.

After Swiss authorities and regulators brokered the takeover deal, announced Sunday, regulators sought to diffuse comparisons to the global financial crisis of 2008.

The former chief executive of UBS' British arm, Mark Yallop, told the BBC that the problems at Credit Suisse were quite specific.

""This is a takeover of a challenged institution with particular idiosyncratic problems that relate to it specifically [and are] not reflective of broader issues in the banking markets,"" said Yallop who is now Chair of the Financial Markets Standards Board, adding that the rescue ""should bring a great degree of confidence back to the banking market more generally.""

The crisis-era head of Britain's top financial watchdog, Lord Turner, said he did not believe the world was facing another banking crisis because banks were now more well-capitalized and the global economy was not facing the imminent crash of a credit-fuelled property bubble.

In a statement, UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said the acquisition was ""attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue.""

""We have structured a transaction which will preserve the value left in the business while limiting our downside exposure,""

""Acquiring Credit Suisse's capabilities in wealth, asset management and Swiss universal banking will augment UBS's strategy of growing its capital-light businesses,"" said Kelleher. ""The transaction will bring benefits to clients and create long-term sustainable value for our investors.

UBS Chief Executive Officer Ralph Hamers said that bringing UBS and Credit Suisse together would build on UBS's strengths and further enhance UBS' ability to serve its clients globally and deepen its best-in-class capabilities.

""The combination supports our growth ambitions in the Americas and Asia while adding scale to our business in Europe, and we look forward to welcoming our new clients and colleagues across the world in the coming weeks,"" added Hamers.

https://www.businessinsider.com/ubs-acquisition-credit-suisse-swiss-banking-wealth-management-2023-3,Swiss Miss: Why UBS's deal with Credit Suisse will threaten its hold on rich clients,"UBS was already a giant in wealth management before it agreed to buy doomed rival Credit Suisse.

Ultra-rich clients are concerned that the acquisition will impact the bank's white-glove service.

Whether clients stay or go depends on how quickly UBS can cure Credit Suisse's woes.

UBS was already the largest private wealth manager in the world before it agreed to buy fellow Swiss bank Credit Suisse. A forced merger will now broaden UBS's already sprawling client base, but it will also invite challenges for its wealth brand across the globe.

UBS and Credit Suisse are both known for servicing the ultra-rich, though UBS does so on a much larger scale. The acquirer had $2.8 trillion in global wealth management assets as of the end of 2022 while Credit Suisse's totalled $585 billion.

Rich clients as well as industry analysts are concerned that UBS will have to spend considerable time and resources to integrate Credit Suisse, which has been plagued by scandals for several years. For instance, Credit Suisse's then-CEO Tidjane Thiam was ousted in 2019 after it was discovered the bank had hired spies to trail star banker Iqbal Khan after he departed for UBS. Khan now leads UBS's global wealth business and could be responsible for integrating the two.

Rich families, who tend to spread their money with banks across the globe, are ""concerned at what UBS might find and the drain it might take on UBS,"" said Wendy Craft, who runs the family office of New York real-estate heir Kent Swig. ""If you need to bank in Switzerland, you may have to, but short of that, folks are in a wait-and-see mode.""

Michael Oliver, cofounder of Global Partnership Family Offices, has gotten numerous inquiries from members of the UK-based family office association about the acquisition. Most are worried about the interruption of the white-glove service they have come to expect from UBS. Credit Suisse's baggage doesn't help UBS's brand either.

""Credit Suisse's reputation is worse than UBS in the family office ecosystem. Does that degrade UBS by their combination? Yes,"" said Oliver.

But he added that this is only one factor in clients' decision-making process when it comes to choosing a wealth manager.

What will determine how many clients stay or go is how quickly UBS can integrate the best parts of Credit Suisse and cut the rest. If the takeover distracts UBS management from its core business of wealth management, this well-heeled crowd has plenty of options outside Switzerland.

One plus one doesn't equal two when it comes to client assets

In the US, little is expected to change when it comes to wealth management as Credit Suisse sold off its domestic wealth business to Wells Fargo in 2015. (Investment banking is another story). Insider spoke to two private wealth advisors based in North America who said they weren't worried and clients have not expressed concerns.

But the impact will be felt overseas. With mass layoffs expected at Credit Suisse, customers may choose to follow their advisors and bankers rather than stay with the newly merged institution, said Max Georgiou, a London-based analyst at Third Bridge.

""Our experts say that with thousands of redundancies on the way, it is highly likely that some of the Credit Suisse management team will use their extensive contacts to start up their own wealth managers,"" Georgiou told Insider. ""These start-ups and the increased competition they will bring could peel away some clients from the newly merged bank.""

Furthermore, this clientele prefers to bank with multiple institutions, he added. As Switzerland only had two banking giants, many clients already had accounts with both. With this merger, they may move some assets to other private banks to reduce exposure. Mid-sized private banks such as Lombard, Julius Baer, and Pictet, may be big beneficiaries from this migration, he said.

According to a Reuters report, Credit Suisse's employees in wealth management in Zurich were reassured at a town hall on Monday that the combined units would act like a ""big family"" and that UBS is weighing financial sweeteners to reassure staff. UBS did not immediately respond to a request to comment on its plans.

Repairing and integrating Credit Suisse might be a distraction

Firdaus Ibrahim, Kuala Lumpur-based senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Insider that the acquisition confers several advantages to UBS, such as more opportunities for cross-selling and a greater foothold in Southeast Asia. That said, while UBS is better placed to fix Credit Suisse's issues, it is still a monumental task.

""There is no quick and easy solution to this. UBS needs to dispose and restructure underperforming business units, put in the right people, and improve risk and control measures throughout the CS business so that past mishaps and scandals do not occur again,"" said Ibrahim. ""All of this requires significant time and effort from the management team.""

Swiss banks, despite their shadowy reputation, are no longer as secretive as they used to be, and have shared account data with foreign tax authorities since 2018.

""The proposition has evolved. It has been as much about discretion as it has been about secrecy for decades now,"" said Oliver. ""There is still an expectation of excellence with Swiss banking: high levels of client service is key.""

The expenses associated with the Credit Suisse acquisition might hamstring UBS when it comes to growth in the US. New York-based recruiter Louis Diamond said these costs may stop the bank's aggressive recruitment efforts.

""Are they going to have enough profits to keep investing in the business because they really need to keep pace with Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo, which are investing heavily in the wealth management business?"" he said. ""That's the big question.""

But the merger gives UBS and Credit Suisse clients the thing that matters most

But the acquisition wasn't just about rescuing Credit Suisse but restoring confidence in the Swiss banking system, Ibrahim noted. The lifeline provided by the Swiss government indicates that the new bank is too big to fail.

""This should strengthen the appeal of Swiss banking industry, in my view, as clients and investors can be assured that their interest is being looked after by the regulators,"" he said.

In the short term, clients are most concerned about deposit safety and asset protection, according to Oliver, despite concerns about future service.

For one Irish billionaire and Credit Suisse client, this is what matters most.

""I don't think there is going to be much change. This is what we have been told so far,"" he said on the condition of anonymity. ""Our relationship person will probably change but that is it. Deposits are safe and that is really what people care about.""",['Hayley Cuccinello'],2023-03-22 00:00:00
https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/24/qatar-doubles-credit-suisse-stake.html,Qatar doubles Credit Suisse stake as embattled lender forges ahead with strategic overhaul,"The Qatar Investment Authority is the second-largest shareholder in Credit Suisse after doubling its stake in the embattled Swiss lender late last year, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The QIA — Qatar's sovereign wealth fund — initially began investing in Credit Suisse around the time of the financial crisis. Now, it owns 6.8% of the bank's shares, according to the filing Friday, second only to the 9.9% stake purchased by the Saudi National Bank last year as part of a $4.2 billion capital raise to fund a massive strategic overhaul.

Combined with the 3.15% owned by Saudi-based family firm Olayan Financing Company, around a fifth of the company's stock is now owned by Middle Eastern investors, Eikon data indicates.

Credit Suisse will report its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on Feb. 9, and has already projected a 1.5 billion Swiss franc ($1.6 billion) loss for the fourth quarter as a result of the ongoing restructuring. The shake-up is designed to address persistent underperformance in the investment bank and a series of risk and compliance failures.

https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/2023/3/20/23648853/credit-suisse-ubs-silicon-valley-signature-banking-crisis,The banking crisis might not be over,"Imperiled bank Credit Suisse was bought by Swiss banking giant UBS Sunday, hours before New York Community Bank announced plans to purchase Signature Bank. The purchases were meant to calm nervous depositors in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s demise earlier this month, but roiling markets on Monday were a reminder that there’s still a lot of uncertainty about whether the banking crisis can be contained.

The good news is that the main factors that brought Credit Suisse to the precipice of collapse don’t seem to be a direct result of the crisis that ended Signature and Silicon Valley Bank, suggesting that other large banks probably aren’t as vulnerable as smaller, regional banks in the US. (Disclosure: Vox Media, which owns Vox, banked with SVB before its closure.)

“Every couple of months, there has been a rumor that Credit Suisse was in trouble and going to go under,” said Itamar Drechsler, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “I don’t think it’s directly a result of [the current crisis.]”

Credit Suisse has been wracked with scandals and major financial losses over the last few years. In 2020, top executives at the bank resigned over a spying scandal targeting its former wealth management head, and last year, a court found that the bank failed to prevent money laundering by a Bulgarian cocaine trafficking gang. The bank also lost more than 7 billion Swiss francs in 2022, its biggest loss since 2008.

All of that may have left Credit Suisse uniquely at risk following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Last week, Credit Suisse’s biggest shareholder, Saudi National Bank, said that it would not be increasing funding to the bank for legal reasons after customers withdrew more than $133 billion last year. That caused the bank’s stock price, which has been falling since 2021, to nosedive 30 percent in a single day.

Credit Suisse’s particular issues mean the impact of its struggles should be isolated for now. Lotfi Karoui, chief credit strategist of Goldman Sachs, said in a statement Sunday that there is “comfort from the limited contagion from US regional banks to larger money center banks, a trend we expect will persist.”

Why the banking crisis may not be over

But some regional banks in the US continue to struggle, with skittish depositors who are worried their money isn’t safe and are withdrawing their funds. The US Federal Reserve has started an emergency lending program to help those institutions stay afloat. And that situation, more than Credit Suisse’s issues, has some economists concerned the banking sector’s problems could set off a long-anticipated recession.

A new paper from researchers at the University of Southern California, Northwestern University, Columbia University, and Stanford University suggests that nearly 190 banks could experience crises similar to that of Silicon Valley Bank — that is, if customers with deposits that exceed the $250,000 limit on deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) decide to withdraw their money. Reuters reported Monday that, on the whole, efforts to calm depositors appear to be working, with some even putting money they’d taken out back in those banks. Some regional banks, however, are notable exceptions.

What’s being done to stop the banking crisis?

The Fed has already invoked several tools at its disposal to staunch the bleeding. It has provided more frequent access to swap operations for foreign banks, essentially providing more US dollar funding to improve liquidity. It is lending to banks at record levels through a program called the “discount window,” under which banks can take out loans for up to 90 days at the federal discount rate by pledging collateral, such as loans and securities. (The Fed says it’s never lost a cent to banks on the program.) And on top of that, it has launched a program to help banks get easy access to up to one-year loans. As of Friday, banks had already borrowed $11.9 billion under the so-called Bank Term Funding Program.

The best way to boost depositors’ confidence might be to do what banks have been asking for: raising or eliminating the $250,000 cap on FDIC-insured deposits. However, that would require congressional intervention, which might be a tall ask. At least four members of Congress, including both Democrats and Republicans, have signaled support for the idea.

“I think the clear thing that would get right at the deepest concerns would be to just ensure virtually all these deposits for the moment like they’re asking and just stop this completely,” Drechsler said. “Despite it being something that a lot of people will say encourages moral hazard — and there may be some truth to that — right now, that would that would be the strongest thing you can do.”

There is also a question as to whether the Fed will continue its strategy of raising interest rates to combat still-rising inflation. The Fed is expected to announce a quarter point rate hike this week, but some economists argue that could pose a risk to the health of the financial system.

“I would raise the probability of a recession given what’s happened in the last week,” Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo, told the New York Times.

But for now, the economic indicators aren’t really pointing in that direction, Drechsler said. Hiring remained strong in February, and unemployment is at its lowest level in 54 years.","['Nicole Narea', 'Kenny Torrella', 'Rachel M.

https://www.investopedia.com/what-happened-at-credit-suisse-and-why-did-it-collapse-7369825,"What Happened at Credit Suisse, and Why Did It Collapse?","In mid-March 2023, Swiss bank UBS Group AG (UBS) bought rival Credit Suisse Group AG for 3 billion CHF (about $3.3 billion USD), a move intended to shore up the global banking system and prevent the latter financial institution from collapsing.

Credit Suisse, one of Switzerland’s leading financial institutions since its predecessor Schweizerische Kreditanstalt was founded in 1856, was among a group of 30 banks known as globally systematically important, and a full collapse might have devastated the global financial system.

Below, we explore what happened with the Credit Suisse crisis and the impact of the bank’s collapse.

Key Takeaways Credit Suisse, the second-largest bank in Switzerland, collapsed in March 2023 and was bought by rival UBS for 3 billion CHF (about $3.3 billion USD).

Credit Suisse faced numerous scandals in recent years, including a spying scandal, the collapse of two investment funds in which the bank was heavily involved, and a rotating group of executives.

Immediately prior to Credit Suisse’s collapse, two U.S. banks—Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank—also collapsed, sending shock waves through the global financial system.

UBS plans to sell off parts of Credit Suisse in the coming months and years.

The impact on Switzerland’s reputation as a global banking hub and a stable financial center may be significant.

About Credit Suisse

As of the end of 2021, Credit Suisse had assets under management (AUM) of 1.6 trillion CHF (about $1.75 trillion), making it the second-largest bank in Switzerland after UBS. At that time, Credit Suisse employed more than 50,000 people. Note that as of year-end 2022, Credit Suisse’s AUM had dropped to about 1.3 trillion CHF (about $1.4 trillion).

Beginning in 2023, Credit Suisse was organized into five divisions: Wealth Management, Swiss Bank, Asset Management, Investment Bank, and Capital Release Unit. At the time of its purchase by UBS, Credit Suisse had about 150 offices in roughly 50 countries around the world.

What Caused the Collapse of Credit Suisse?

Despite its long history, Credit Suisse was plagued by a series of scandals, management shifts, and significant losses in recent years.

In February 2020, Credit Suisse’s then-CEO, Tidjane Thiam, resigned after a 2019 spying scandal. Credit Suisse’s wealth management boss, Iqbal Khan, left for UBS and was subsequently surveilled by private contractors in an effort to determine whether he poached clients.

In 2021, amid the pandemic, the collapse of the U.S. family investment fund Archegos Capital and British finance firm Greensill Capital triggered a pretax loss of close to $1 billion for Credit Suisse. Following the collapse of Archegos, Credit Suisse’s investment bank CEO and chief risk and compliance officer left the company. An independent investigation of Credit Suisse’s role in the Archegos scandal found that the bank had failed to “effectively manage risk,” but suggested that no fraudulent or illegal conduct occurred.

Months later, in January 2022, Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio resigned from the bank’s board after about nine months in the position over a scandal related to his breaching of Swiss and British COVID-19 quarantine protocols.



By late summer 2022, new CEO Ulrich Koerner unveiled a strategic review that was hindered by an unsubstantiated rumor that Credit Suisse was facing an impending failure. This prompted clients to pull 110 billion CHF (about $119 billion) of funds in the final quarter of 2022.



Facing a stock that shed about three-quarters of its value in a year, Credit Suisse announced plans in early 2023 to borrow up to $54 billion to shore up liquidity and boost investor confidence. However, by mid-March, the bank’s top backer, Saudi National Bank, said it would not give more money to Credit Suisse as a result of regulatory barriers.

One of the final developments prior to UBS’ purchase of Credit Suisse was the collapses of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in early March 2023. They prompted the U.S. government to make sweeping promises to depositors that money would be available but nevertheless sent fear throughout the global banking system.

Timeline of the Collapse

In summary, the key events leading up to the collapse of Credit Suisse include:

2019 and early 2020: Credit Suisse faces a spying scandal regarding an outgoing wealth management executive; then-CEO Tidjane Thiam resigns.

2021: Archegos Capital and Greensill Capital collapse, leading to $1 billion in losses for Credit Suisse and another management shake-up.

January 2022: Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio resigns from the company following news that he broke COVID-19 quarantine regulations.

July and August 2022: Rumor circulates that Credit Suisse faces impending failure, prompting clients to pull about $119 billion in funds in the last quarter of the year.

January 2023: Credit Suisse says it will borrow up to $54 billion to shore up liquidity, but top backer Saudi National Bank says it will not give money because of regulatory issues.

March 2023: U.S. institutions Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank fail, setting the global financial system on edge.

March 2023: Switzerland’s executive branch votes to allow the takeover without shareholder approval.

Impact of the Collapse

The impact of UBS’ takeover of Credit Suisse is wide-ranging. For the bank’s offices around the world and its 50,000 employees, the future remains uncertain, as UBS could absorb some or all of them and shutter or lay off others. UBS is expected to have roughly $5 trillion in AUM following the deal.

The global financial system responded with measures to attempt to stabilize banks. Central banks moved to coordinate daily access to a lending facility for banks seeking to borrow U.S. dollars in the immediate aftermath of the takeover. Switzerland’s government is particularly impacted, as it has agreed to provide 100 billion CHF ($108.4 billion) to ensure the deal is completed. For investors, about 16 billion CHF (more than $17 billion) in Credit Suisse’s contingent convertible bonds are wiped out as part of the takeover.

The collapse of Credit Suisse could also impact Switzerland’s reputation as a stable, strong country for banking. The loss of one of the country’s oldest financial institutions, the bank that bankrolled the construction of Switzerland’s railways, could leave Swiss citizens in and out of the banking industry devastated.

Acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS

UBS’ purchase of Credit Suisse was orchestrated and approved by regulators. The price tag of more than $3 billion for the deal is modest compared with the size of the bank and its assets. UBS officials also said immediately following news of the purchase that they planned to reduce the size of Credit Suisse in the coming years, potentially by selling off parts of the bank, although details remain scarce.

Bailout vs. Merger vs. Takeover Several related terms may be used to describe situations like Credit Suisse’s, including bailout, merger, and takeover, but there are key distinctions.



A bailout is when an individual, business, or organization provides capital or other resources to a failing company to prevent it from collapsing.

A merger is a type of agreement that unites two companies into one, often with one company that is struggling subsumed by the other.

A takeover is when a company successfully bids to take over another, gaining control of its assets. Officially, the UBS/Credit Suisse deal is a merger.

What will happen to Credit Suisse stock? Per the agreement, Credit Suisse shareholders will receive one UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares held. Credit Suisse stock will be delisted by the time the deal is completed, likely by the end of 2023.

Which is bigger, UBS or Credit Suisse? By assets under management (AUM), UBS is the largest bank in Switzerland, and Credit Suisse was the second-largest.

How much will UBS pay for Credit Suisse? UBS’ bid to assume control of Credit Suisse was 3 billion CHF, or roughly $3.3 billion.

How is Saudi Arabia involved in the collapse of Credit Suisse? Saudi Arabia’s Saudi National Bank invested about $1.4 billion for a 10% stake in Credit Suisse in late 2022, making it Credit Suisse’s largest shareholder.

How is the collapse of Credit Suisse related to the Silicon Valley Bank collapse? The specifics of the collapses of Credit Suisse and Silicon Valley Bank are different. However, the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in close succession in the United States did frighten regulators and investors worldwide and led to U.S. government measures to stabilize the global financial system.

The Bottom Line

Following several years of scandals, Switzerland’s Credit Suisse bank collapsed in March 2023. It was purchased by Swiss rival UBS for about $3.3 billion in a deal approved by Swiss regulators without shareholder approval. UBS plans to sell off and downsize parts of Credit Suisse in the process.

Following the completion of the merger, Switzerland will have only one major financial institution, and the country’s reputation for banking stability may have been shaken.","['Nathan Reiff', 'Nathan Reiff Has Been Writing Expert Articles', 'News About Financial Topics Such As Investing', 'Trading', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Etfs', 'Alternative Investments On Investopedia Since', 'Learn About Our', 'Editorial Policies', 'Vikki Velasquez']",2023-04-05 18:33:13.745000+00:00

It's official: UBS is acquiring Credit Suisse in a historic rescue takeover.

The deal was brokered by the Swiss national bank and sealed over the course of a dramatic weekend. Two fierce domestic rivals will become one. UBS will now decide which Credit Suisse businesses it wants to keep at the bank, and which of its rival's execs could play an important role in the new UBS.

There's still much that's uncertain, but one thing's clear from how this unfolded: UBS really didn't want to have to rescue its rival, and Credit Suisse isn't thrilled with this outcome either.

The announcements and official statements around the deal were filled with technical finance jargon around liquidity support and the like, but buried beneath the details were subtweets and sly digs.

For example, the first official word of the deal came from the Swiss National Bank, which announced: ""UBS today announced the takeover of Credit Suisse."" At the time, UBS had done no such thing.

The statement went on to detail some of the extraordinary terms of the deal, saying:

""With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation.""

Next, Credit Suisse announced: ""Credit Suisse and UBS to Merge.""

A merger! Not a rescue takeover. A merger! The statement read:

""Credit Suisse and UBS have entered into a merger agreement on Sunday following the intervention of the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, the Swiss National Bank and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA (FINMA). UBS will be the surviving entity upon closing of the merger transaction.""

The wording of ""following the intervention of"" makes clear this deal was not Credit Suisse's decision. And ""UBS will be the surviving entity"" spells out that this is a takeover and not a merger.

The statement gives further clarity to the government's role, going on to say the deal came after the Swiss authorities ""asked both companies to conclude the transaction to restore necessary confidence in the stability of the Swiss economy and banking system.""

Credit Suisse's statement finished with a word from its chairman Axel Lehmann (emphasis mine):

""Given recent extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances, the announced merger represents the best available outcome. This has been an extremely challenging time for Credit Suisse and while the team has worked tirelessly to address many significant legacy issues and execute on its new strategy, we are forced to reach a solution today that provides a durable outcome.""

At this point, UBS, the bank making the acquisition in this case, had not made a statement. Normally, the acquirer is the one leading the charge in announcing a transaction. Here, it was bringing up the rear.

When UBS did make a statement, it thoroughly undermined the Credit Suisse announcement. Headline: ""UBS to acquire Credit Suisse.""

It was Colm Kelleher, UBS chairman and a veteran of the financial crisis, who delivered the coup de grâce. He said in a statement (emphasis mine):

""This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue. We have structured a transaction which will preserve the value left in the business while limiting our downside exposure.""

Credit Suisse says it's a merger. UBS says it's an emergency rescue. Ha! The UBS statement also confirmed that the takeover discussions were initiated by Swiss authorities.

Even a potential photo op marking the occasion was ruined by an awkward moment in which Kelleher waited to shake hands with Lehmann. (The two eventually did connect, for the record.)

—Peter Thal Larsen (@peter_tl) March 20, 2023

For UBS, acquiring Credit Suisse's businesses in wealth, asset management, and Swiss banking promises potential benefits. The future of Credit Suisse's investment banking business remains unclear however, with UBS promising to move the majority of its rival's markets positions to a non-core operation that would be managed down.

[Side note: The job of combining the wealth businesses will fall to Iqbal Khan, who runs UBS wealth management and used to work at Credit Suisse. In 2019, after UBS announced Khan's hire, the chief operating officer at Credit Suisse ordered a colleague to spy on him. Awkward!]

Later, on a call with analysts, Kelleher and UBS CEO Ralph Hamers defended the deal while simultaneously making it clear they themselves didn't want to do, as my colleague Rebecca Ungarino reported.

""It's a historic day in Switzerland and a day, frankly, we hoped would not come,"" Kelleher said.",['Matt Turner'],2023-03-20 00:00:00

LONDON/ZURICH, March 17 (Reuters) - Shares in Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) resumed their decline on Friday as investor sentiment remained fragile following a $54 billion lifeline the Swiss bank secured this week.

""While markets are relieved that the Swiss central bank stepped in, sentiment is bound to remain very fragile, particularly as investors will likely worry about the eventual economic impact of aggressive monetary policy tightening by the European Central Bank (ECB),"" she added.

Credit Suisse has seen more than $200 million net outflows from its U.S. and European managed funds since March 13, Morningstar Direct said on Friday.

DBRS Morningstar on Thursday became the first global rating agency to cut the bank's credit score, with a downgrade to ""BBB"", which is still investment grade.

The head of the Credit Suisse's Swiss business said late on Thursday the new funding would allow the bank to continue with its turnaround plan, although it could take time to win back client confidence.

""We are still a little cautious here but there certainly has been more positive news on Credit Suisse,"" said John Milroy, investment adviser at Ord Minnett.

In a further sign that concern about banking stress remains elevated, the ECB Supervisory Board convened an unscheduled meeting on Friday to discuss stress and vulnerabilities in the euro zone bank sector.

The ECB supervisors were informed that deposits remained stable across euro zone banks and exposure to Credit Suisse was immaterial, a source familiar with the meeting's content told Reuters.

BANK LIFELINES

Credit Suisse became the first major global bank to take up an emergency lifeline since the 2008 financial crisis, fuelling doubts over whether central banks will be able to sustain aggressive rate hikes to rein in inflation.

The ECB pressed forward with a 50 basis point rate hike on Thursday as it prioritized trying to bring inflation, currently at 8.5%, back to its 2% target. The central bank said euro zone banks are in better shape than they were in 2008.

A $30 billion lifeline for U.S.-based First Republic Bank (FRC.N) on Thursday also failed to reassure the market as investors remained concerned about cracks in the sector after the collapse of two other mid-sized U.S. lenders over the past week. Shares in First Republic were down 27.5% on Friday.

Credit Suisse shares had their worst week since the beginning of COVID 19 lockdown in March 2020, losing 25.5%.

Underscoring the febrile state of markets, European banking stocks (.SX7P) fell almost 3% on Friday and nursed heavy weekly losses - down almost 12% in their biggest weekly fall in a year.

The banking sector has been in turmoil following the collapse last week of U.S. Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).

U.S. shareholders of Credit Suisse sued the bank on Thursday, claiming it defrauded them by concealing problems with its finances. Credit Suisse declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Swiss lawmakers on Friday vowed to bring those responsible for Credit Suisse's problems to account and urged it to clean up its act after years of scandals, as they sought to contain the crisis and limit any reputational damage to the country.

What does the acquisition mean for the global economy, and what are financial insiders saying about it? Here's everything you need to know:

What are the details of the purchase?

Credit Suisse announced it had been acquired by UBS for $3.2 billion, saying that the two banks ""concluded that it would be in the best interest of their shareholders and their stakeholders to enter into the merger"" amidst ongoing concerns over the global economy. Credit Suisse notes that the deal was completed after the Swiss government ""asked both companies to conclude the transaction to restore necessary confidence in the stability of the Swiss economy and banking system.""

The deal is ""perhaps the most sweeping shake-up of the global banking sector since the 2008 financial crisis, when one-time financial giants were acquired by rivals to avoid catastrophic meltdowns,"" The New York Times says. The 166-year-old bank, once a staple Swiss institution, has been beset by recent scandals and lawsuits that have drastically hurt its reputation. The recent fall of American bank SVB and the potential for similar bank implosions were the final straw, and exposed Credit Suisse's ""longstanding vulnerabilities into sharp relief and hastened its demise — highlighting just how panicked investors are,"" the Times adds.

What effect will Credit Suisse's acquisition have on the world economy?

Switzerland is a pillar of the global banking system, and the government's push for the acquisition ""[suggests] they're deeply concerned about the ongoing banking crisis,"" Insider reports, and the efforts of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks to assist foreign markets reflect this global concern.

The merger ""also has clear parallels with the banking deals sealed during and after the 2008 financial crisis,"" Insider adds. During this period of conglomerate mergers, J.P. Morgan acquired Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch, and Well Fargo snagged Wachovia.",['Justin Klawans'],2023-03-21 00:00:00

LONDON (AP) — Credit Suisse shares plunged Monday after Swiss authorities cut a deal with its bigger rival UBS to acquire the troubled bank at a marked-down price. But European bank stocks and the wider market gained as investors watch whether moves to shore up banks will stem further upheaval in the global financial system.

Shares of Credit Suisse, whose woes stem from questions over its internal controls, closed nearly 56% lower a day after UBS said it would buy its fellow Swiss bank for a lowball price of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion). The shares traded at about the level they are valued at in the deal.

Swiss regulators orchestrated the purchase in a bid to stop more turmoil after the collapse of two U.S. banks. In an indication of the frantic, behind-the-scenes deal-making to resolve the issue before markets opened, the acquisition was announced late Sunday.

There is still uncertainty over how the deal will play out for the combined lender and what comes next for the wider banking system. Analysts say some previous forced bank mergers didn’t work out well for shareholders in the long run.

It could be that no more banks get into trouble, but it’s also possible that “we just go from one weak institution falling over to the next,” said Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser at Capital Economics.

There no other obvious candidates that could be singled out like Credit Suisse, but it’s “hard to predict where the problems will emerge,” she said.

UBS shares initially dropped on the Swiss stock exchange but closed up 1.3%. The deal whipsawed other European bank stocks, which tumbled before some clawed back their losses. Germany’s Deutsche Bank, France’s BNP Paribas and Italy’s UniCredit ended higher, while London-based Barclays sank 2.3%.

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after a central bank plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) last week failed to reassure investors and customers.

Many of Credit Suisse’s problems were unique and unlike the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S., including high interest rates. Those U.S. failures have raised questions about other potentially weak global financial institutions, sweeping up the already beleaguered Swiss bank.

Credit Suisse has faced an array of troubles in recent years, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shakeups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

Analysts and financial leaders say safeguards are stronger since the 2008 global financial crisis and that banks worldwide have plenty of available cash and support from central banks. But concerns about risks to the deal, losses for some investors and Credit Suisse’s falling market value could renew fears about the health of banks.

Tobias Straumann, an economic history professor at University of Zurich, said the merger was the right move because the U.S. bank collapses and the danger to Credit Suisse was “an international banking crisis in the making.”

“Markets are very nervous, and I think an additional accident in Switzerland would have fueled a lot of problems,” he said.

Credit Suisse is among 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities were worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

UBS is bigger but Credit Suisse wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. It has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich through its wealth management business, and is a major mergers and acquisitions adviser. However, Credit Suisse weathered the 2008 financial crisis without assistance, unlike UBS.

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in higher-risk Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out, leaving investors with hefty losses. Lawyers were already circling, eyeing possible legal action to get compensation for bondholders amid concern about the market for those bonds and other banks that hold them.

The combination of the two Swiss banks, each with histories dating to the mid-19th century, strikes at the country’s reputation as a global financial center — putting it on the cusp of having a single big national bank that would be too big to fail.

Some customers were caught off guard by the turmoil, at odds with Switzerland’s reputation as as stable banking haven.

Sahil Dua, an Indian software engineer living in Zurich, holds a UBS account but opened one at Credit Suisse last Tuesday, the same day the lender flagged “material weaknesses” in internal financial controls that ultimately helped spark its downward spiral.

“My impression as a customer,” Dua said, is “that at least these two banks were going to be fine, whatever happens.”

Dua said he wanted the credit card that came with the Credit Suisse account and that he considered switching over his primary bank account and bringing his savings from UBS. Not anymore.

He has a Credit Suisse account “with a balance of zero, and I’m glad that it’s still zero because I didn’t add any money yet to it.” In the future, he plans to spread out his money in more than one bank.

“I will look into diversification more seriously now,” Dua said.

As the market tries to figure out what comes next after the merger, Straumann, the professor, said he wouldn’t be surprised to see problems for regional banks in Europe after further interest rate increases, much like what happened with midsized banks in U.S.

“The banking system of Europe has not fully recovered from the crisis” in 2008, he said. “It’s better, of course, than it used to be, but it’s vulnerable.”

ZURICH/BERN (Reuters) -Switzerland's tradition of dependable consensus politics has taken a battering after the government used an emergency law to push through a state-backed mega-merger of UBS and Credit Suisse, sidelining the country's parliament.

Switzerland's two parliamentary chambers voted to reject the government's 109 billion Swiss francs ($122.82 billion) in aid for the deal between the country's two biggest banks, delivering a slap in the face for government.

The defeat is symbolic as it cannot change the merger, but it is a blow for the government in an election year and makes it harder to build broad support among the population for the biggest corporate rescue in Swiss history.

The use of emergency laws, in which shareholders and parliamentarians have no say, will also damage the standing of Switzerland's financial industry abroad, analysts have said, especially as it faces rising competition from other financial centres like Singapore.

The Swiss political model is under pressure at the moment, said political scientist Michael Hermann, a director of pollsters Sotomo, adding that the foreign perception of Switzerland as business friendly and as a financial safe haven could be undermined.

""Legitimacy in Swiss politics has been weakened, People who worried about an over powerful government during COVID will see their fears confirmed,"" said Hermann.

""This is damaging for the trust in democracy – parliament says no, but the emergency credits still go through.""

A recent Sotomo poll showed two thirds of the population was against the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse, while a third of respondents were angry that emergency laws had been used to bypass parliament.

The affair has already boosted support for populist right wing groups like the anti-immigrant Swiss People's Party (SVP) and the libertarian Aufrecht Schweiz movement in local elections since the takeover. Both parties are looking to make gains in national elections in October.

PARLIAMENT 'CIRCUMVENTED'

The Credit Suisse/UBS merger marked the first time that parliament had withheld its support for emergency laws designed to deal quickly with crises.

The facility to act without parliamentary approval, introduced in 2000, was used during the COVID pandemic to enforce restrictions and again last year to provide a Swiss energy producer with a credit line.

In the lead-up to the UBS/Credit Suisse merger last month, Swiss emergency law allowed a sub-group of six members of parliament to approve a cabinet plan to give financial aid on behalf of the legislative body, angering the almost 250 lawmakers, who were left without a say.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter defended the use of the emergency powers, saying Switzerland was not an ""emergency dictatorship.""

""We don't do it for fun. We really didn't know what else to do,"" Keller-Sutter told parliament during a stormy emergency session this week. ""The emergency law is based on the federal constitution and I don't think it's correct to say it's illegal.""

Lawmakers were dismayed.

""It has not been a great moment for Swiss democracy. It is terrible parliament has been put in this position and basically circumvented,"" said Roger Nordmann, leader of the Social Democrat group in the Swiss lower house told Reuters.

The Swiss government said it would take into account the rejection by parliament, but stressed the success of the takeover of Switzerland's second biggest bank - intended to prevent a financial meltdown - was paramount.

Industry experts said the deal was unlikely to be changed by politicians, with UBS being given a free hand to determine how many jobs will go and what will be done with Credit Suisse's valuable domestic retail banking business.

Swiss media has reported that the takeover could result in the combined bank cutting its Swiss workforce by up to 30%, which could cost 11,000 jobs.

""Despite the anger, most policy-makers do not want to interfere in the merger, to create and bear the risk that the merger does not succeed,"" said Hans Gersbach, co-director of the KOF economic research institute at ETH Zurich.

""Politicians might have wanted to show their disapproval about what happened, but they don’t want the UBS takeover to fail.""

Ultimately, 209 billion Swiss francs are being provided as state and central bank guarantees and support in the plan drawn up by the seven-strong Swiss cabinet, which has members from four political parties.

The amount is equivalent to around a quarter of Switzerland's entire economic output, and includes emergency liquidity injections and a state pledge to absorb up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS, based on documents outlining the deal.

Peter Kunz, an expert in economic law at the University of Bern, said the lawmakers were ultimately powerless to change it.

""In Switzerland, we often pat ourselves on the back for having the oldest democracy in the world. Yet seven people decided on 250 billion francs of support, an unimaginably huge sum of money,"" he said.

""And the parliament has no say in the matter. The use of such emergency legislation, overturning antitrust rules, is a problem for Swiss democracy and rule of law. It calls Swiss democracy into question.""

https://news.yahoo.com/credit-suisse-bank-ubs-said-014656907.html,Credit Suisse bank: UBS is in talks to take over its troubled rival,"Credit Suisse has faced a string of scandals in recent years, including money laundering charges

Switzerland's biggest bank, UBS, is in advanced talks to buy all or part of its troubled rival Credit Suisse.

Credit Suisse, the second largest Swiss bank, is facing a crisis of confidence and its shares have fallen sharply in recent days, sending ripples of concern through the markets.

According to the Financial Times UBS is offering to pay up to $1bn (£820m) for Credit Suisse.

Regulators are trying to facilitate a deal before markets reopen on Monday.

The trouble at Credit Suisse, combined with the failure of two smaller US banks during the last two weeks, have thrown the health of the global financial system into doubt.

Credit Suisse is one of around 30 banks worldwide deemed too big to fail because they are of such importance to the banking system.

But the 167-year-old institution is loss-making and has faced a string of problems in recent years, including money laundering charges.

An emergency $54bn (£44.5bn) lifeline from the Swiss National Bank on Wednesday failed to reassure markets and Credit Suisse shares tumbled 24%, prompting a wider sell-off on European markets.

A deal could be signed as soon as Sunday evening, according to the FT, which first reported that regulators and the Swiss National Bank were facilitating talks between the two Swiss banking giants.

The deal currently believed to be on the table would value Credit Suisse shares at less than a seventh of the price they were on Friday. However the FT said terms could change and a deal had not yet been reached.

Senior figures from UBS were seen heading to the Swiss government's finance department on Sunday

UBS shareholders would normally have six weeks to consider a deal on this scale, but the FT says the Swiss authorities are planning to change the country's laws to bypass a shareholder vote on the transaction.

Bank of England officials have confirmed they are in close contact with their counterparts at the Swiss National Bank while regulators and management discuss Credit Suisse's future. The UK Treasury is also monitoring the situation.

Story continues

The deal would amount to a significant intervention from the Swiss authorities, said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor to German financial services firm Allianz.

""This is not a voluntary action, this is a shotgun wedding and it's being done in order to restore financial stability,"" Mr El-Erian told the BBC. ""Without it Credit Suisse may end up in a death spiral, in which it finds it much harder to undertake its banking activities.

""That could raise questions about other banks at a time when there are also banking concerns in the United States.""

Mr El-Erian said the current turmoil could lead to banks becoming more ""risk averse"", leading to a fall in credit availability.

But that amounted to a ""headwind"" for the global economy, rather than something like the sudden stop experienced during the 2008 financial crisis, which was ""in a completely different league"" to today's problems, he said.

UBS is said to have asked the Swiss government to cover about $6bn (£4.9bn) in costs if it were to buy Credit Suisse, according to sources quoted by Reuters.

Credit Suisse reported a loss of 7.3bn Swiss francs ($7.9bn; £6.5bn) in 2022 - its worst year since the financial crisis of 2008 - and has warned it does not expect to be profitable until 2024.

UBS, however, made a profit of $7.6bn in 2022.

Any deal may also result in significant job losses.

As well as being a domestic bank with 95 branches, Credit Suisse has a global investment banking operation and manages the assets of rich clients.

At the end of last year Credit Suisse had a global staff of 50,480, including 16,700 in Switzerland, though 9,000 jobs were to be axed, the Swiss broadcaster SRF reports.","['Kathryn Armstrong', 'Lucy Hooker - Bbc News']",
https://www.ibtimes.com/credit-suisse-collapse-leaves-sports-sponsorships-limbo-3679611,Credit Suisse Collapse Leaves Sports Sponsorships In Limbo,"The takeover of Swiss bank Credit Suisse leaves many sports stars, teams and tournaments with a big question mark hanging over their lucrative sponsorship deals.

The Swiss national football team, the country's top football division, tennis great Roger Federer, golf star Sergio Garcia and Zurich's new stadium were all sponsored by the bank, which is being taken over by Swiss rival UBS.

The deal was hastily arranged on Sunday after Credit Suisse's share price plunged.

Golf and equestrian events also relied on Credit Suisse money, as did the Swiss Sport Aid Foundation, which backs talented young athletes in minority sports.

""Our sponsorships reflect our passion for excellence, sustainability, and partnership,"" Credit Suisse boasts.

The Neue Zurcher Zeitung newspaper said that no matter how much Credit Suisse got embroiled in scandals or rejigged its strategies, ""the bank has always been a reliable partner for sports"".

""For the time being, we will continue our corresponding commitments unchanged,"" a Credit Suisse spokesman told AFP.

But UBS, which has its own portfolio of sports sponsorships focusing on Formula One, athletics and ice hockey, may not necessarily continue with the deals.

Credit Suisse has been the main sponsor of the Swiss Football Association (SFA) governing body since 1993.

The men's national team, ranked 12th in the world, has enjoyed some of its best years since the bank came on board.

Having only appeared at one World Cup between 1966 and 2006, Switzerland have qualified for the last five World Cups, reaching the last 16 in four of those tournaments.

The contract runs until June 30 next year. It is worth around five million Swiss francs ($5.4 million) per year, according to Blick newspaper.

The Credit Suisse logo will stay on the national teams' training jackets and jerseys for as long as the bank exists, SFA spokesman Adrian Arnold said ahead of Saturday's Euro 2024 qualifier against Belarus.

""We had good discussions with our contacts at Credit Suisse, who assured us that the existing contracts would be honoured,"" Arnold said.

""We would like the partnership to continue thereafter, in whatever form.""

Credit Suisse is also the main sponsor of Switzerland's bid to host the 2025 women's European Championships, and the takeover comes shortly before the hosting decision is due on April 4.

The bank is the title sponsor of the Super League, Switzerland's 10-team top football division, including well-known clubs like Young Boys, Grasshopper, FC Zurich and FC Basel.

Blick said the contract runs until 2025 and is worth around eight million Swiss francs ($8.7 million) per season.

Money goes into every club as well as the tournament, with the bank's name appearing on all team strips and on advertising boards around the stadiums.

In 2019, the bank won the naming rights for a proposed new football stadium in Zurich, where Grasshopper and FC Zurich are expected to play.

But the planned ""Credit Suisse Arena"" has faced delays. It was due to open in mid-2022, but little progress has been made and its future now seems even more uncertain.

Federer is by far the biggest name associated with Credit Suisse.

Although Switzerland's greatest sports star retired in September, he remains a brand ambassador for Credit Suisse.

The bank was on board for his transition into a post-tennis career, saying: ""We look forward to many more years together"".

Federer has a host of other sponsors he can fall back on, including Rolex, Lindt, Mercedes-Benz and Moet et Chandon.

Credit Suisse also sponsors the Federer-instigated Laver Cup, which features six top men's tennis players from Europe against six from the rest of the world, captained by Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe.

The Laver Cup did not respond when contacted by AFP.

In golf, Credit Suisse sponsored the European Masters golf tournament in Crans-Montana and Spanish former world number two Garcia, who won the 2017 Masters.

European Masters tournament director Yves Mittaz said the contract runs until the 2024 tournament so the event is not at risk.

""There is no reason to panic,"" he told the Tribune de Geneve newspaper.

""That's the business of sport: sponsors leave, others arrive.""

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading minority and Woman-owned national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia.

As detailed below, the lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) contrary to Defendant Lehmann's representations in December 2022, the sharp increase in customer outflows Credit Suisse began experiencing in October 2022 remained ongoing; (2) accordingly, Credit Suisse had downplayed the impact of the Company's recent series of quarterly losses and risk and compliance failures on liquidity and its ability to retain client funds; (3) as a result, Credit Suisse had overstated the Company's financial position and/or prospects; and (4) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On February 9, 2023, Credit Suisse issued a press release announcing its 2022 financial results. The press release revealed that, contrary to Defendant Lehmann's prior statements, large customer outflows had continued through yearend 2022. Specifically, the press release reported customer outflows of 110.5 billion Swiss francs in the final three months of 2022, a figure which far exceeded market expectations.

On this news, Credit Suisse's ADS price fell $0.56 per ADS, or 15.64%, to close at $3.02 per ADS on February 9, 2023.

Then, on February 21, 2023, Reuters reported that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (""FINMA""), was reviewing Defendant Lehmann's previous comments regarding customer outflows.

On this news, Credit Suisse's ADS price fell another $0.10 per ADS, or 3.31%, to close at $2.92 per ADS on February 21, 2023.

As a result of Defendants' wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company's securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.

WASHINGTON, April 14 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's Board of Governors on Friday said it has approved UBS Group AG's acquisition of the U.S. subsidiaries of Credit Suisse, clearing another major hurdle for the completion of the Swiss-brokered rescue deal.

UBS has committed to give the U.S. central bank an implementation plan for combining its U.S. business and operations with those of Credit Suisse within three months of consummating the deal, the Fed's Board said in a statement. The plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution, the statement said.

The U.S. central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

UBS had requested the Fed's approval of the merger March 22, the Fed said.

After years of scandal and losses, 167-year-old Credit Suisse came to the brink of collapse before Zurich-based rival UBS rode to the rescue with a merger engineered and bankrolled by the Swiss authorities last month. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

The Swiss authorities and UBS Group AG have been racing to close the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG within as little as a month, in an effort to retain the lender's clients and employees, Reuters previously reported.

UBS secured a temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, people familiar with the process told Reuters.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

The Fed subjects firms with more than $700 billion in assets, or more than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activities, to heightened supervision, including annual company-run stress tests and increased liquidity standards.

UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

The Swiss authorities and UBS Group AG have been racing to close the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG within as little as a month, in an effort to retain the lender's clients and employees, Reuters previously reported.

UBS secured a temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, people familiar with the process told Reuters.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Under the Credit Suisse UBS merger deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

https://www.finews.com/news/english-news/56833-karin-keller-sutter-ubs-credit-suisse-deal,Is the UBS-Credit Suisse Deal on the Brink of Collapse?,"Emergency law was used to push through the Credit Suisse takeover by UBS, with subsequent approval by the Federal Assembly as merely a formality according to the Swiss Finance Minister. Legal experts see otherwise.

After the Swiss federal government came to the rescue of Credit Suisse with a forced takeover by UBS, Swiss Federal Councillor and Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said billions of government funds granted through emergency legislation were «fully committed.» By taking that route, approval through an extraordinary session of parliament was to have been a formality.

Legal experts disagree. Articles 28 and 34 of the Financial Budget Act stipulate that «urgent» credits require not only prior approval of the finance delegation but also that of parliament, as reported by the «Blick am Sonntag» (in German) over the weekend.

The word «approval» is crucial, says University of Fribourg constitutional law professor Andreas Stoeckli, «It means that the parliament's decision has legally binding force.»

Legal Obligations

Bernhard Ruetsche, professor of public law at the University of Lucerne, agrees. In the context of the genesis of federal law, from the wording «subsequent approval,» it can be concluded, «that urgent commitment credits decided by the Federal Council with the approval of the finance delegation lose their legal validity if not approved by the Federal Assembly.»

Still, according to Ruetsche, legal obligations entered into by the Federal Council before non-approval by parliament remain in place due to the protection of legitimate expectations and legal clarity. The question is whether or not such obligations exist.

Tricky Situation

A default guarantee exists for the liquidity support from the SNB, goes the argument of the Federal Department of Finance (FDF). The situation is different for the loss protection for UBS in the amount of nine billion, which has not yet been contractually set. Stoeckli says that «Written form is a prerequisite for the guarantee of a contract. The relevant article in the emergency decree is not an obligation, but merely an authorization.»

He also says not all the essential points of the guarantee are contained there. Whether or not the Federal Council's declarations of intent have legal consequences for the federal government must be clarified in detail, Stoeckli said. It's a tricky situation because the deal could fall through if the Federal Council does not sign the contract. «But it is doubtful whether the Federal Council will be allowed to sign the contract at all after the parliament's 'no' vote.»

UBS declined to comment on whether it would seek to claim damages if there is no contract. Meanwhile, the FDF maintains that «the rejection has no impact on the guarantees.»

One National Councilor said that if the Finance Department's interpretation does not pass legal muster, «this is a scandal in terms of national policy» and if true, «Keller-Sutter must resign.»",[],2023-04-17 06:22:50

UBS has committed to give the US central bank an implementation plan for combining its US business and operations with those of Credit Suisse within three months of consummating the deal, the Fed’s Board said in a statement. The plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution, the statement said.

The US central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion (CHF223 billion) of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

UBS had requested the Fed’s approval of the merger on March 22, the Fed said.

The Fed subjects firms with more than $700 billion in assets, or more than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activities, to heightened supervision, including annual company-run stress tests and increased liquidity standards.

International backing On Friday, Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said in Washington that “it was recognised at the international level that the solution found [by Switzerland] had helped to avoid an international financial crisis”. Keller-Sutter was in the US capital for meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. She also commented on the rejection of the deal by the Swiss parliament this week, which she said would have “no consequence” on the takeover being completed. Swiss National Bank President Thomas Jordan also said on Friday that his counterparts had welcomed the fast action of the Swiss government, which had prevented the Alpine Nation becoming “the first domino in a systemic crisis”. For the BNS boss, the goal now is to successfully complete the merger of the two banks: “only this will create the necessary stability”, he said. At that point, laws around “too big to fail” banks can be revised and updated to reflect lessons learned. End of insertion

ZURICH/BERN (Reuters) -Switzerland's tradition of dependable consensus politics has taken a battering after the government used an emergency law to push through a state-backed mega-merger of UBS and Credit Suisse, sidelining the country's parliament.

Switzerland's two parliamentary chambers voted to reject the government's 109 billion Swiss francs ($122.82 billion) in aid for the deal between the country's two biggest banks, delivering a slap in the face for government.

The defeat is symbolic as it cannot change the merger, but it is a blow for the government in an election year and makes it harder to build broad support among the population for the biggest corporate rescue in Swiss history.

The use of emergency laws, in which shareholders and parliamentarians have no say, will also damage the standing of Switzerland's financial industry abroad, analysts have said, especially as it faces rising competition from other financial centres like Singapore.

The Swiss political model is under pressure at the moment, said political scientist Michael Hermann, a director of pollsters Sotomo, adding that the foreign perception of Switzerland as business friendly and as a financial safe haven could be undermined.

""Legitimacy in Swiss politics has been weakened, People who worried about an over powerful government during COVID will see their fears confirmed,"" said Hermann.

""This is damaging for the trust in democracy – parliament says no, but the emergency credits still go through.""

A recent Sotomo poll showed two thirds of the population was against the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse, while a third of respondents were angry that emergency laws had been used to bypass parliament.

The affair has already boosted support for populist right wing groups like the anti-immigrant Swiss People's Party (SVP) and the libertarian Aufrecht Schweiz movement in local elections since the takeover. Both parties are looking to make gains in national elections in October.

PARLIAMENT 'CIRCUMVENTED'

The Credit Suisse/UBS merger marked the first time that parliament had withheld its support for emergency laws designed to deal quickly with crises.

The facility to act without parliamentary approval, introduced in 2000, was used during the COVID pandemic to enforce restrictions and again last year to provide a Swiss energy producer with a credit line.

In the lead-up to the UBS/Credit Suisse merger last month, Swiss emergency law allowed a sub-group of six members of parliament to approve a cabinet plan to give financial aid on behalf of the legislative body, angering the almost 250 lawmakers, who were left without a say.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter defended the use of the emergency powers, saying Switzerland was not an ""emergency dictatorship.""

""We don't do it for fun. We really didn't know what else to do,"" Keller-Sutter told parliament during a stormy emergency session this week. ""The emergency law is based on the federal constitution and I don't think it's correct to say it's illegal.""

Lawmakers were dismayed.

""It has not been a great moment for Swiss democracy. It is terrible parliament has been put in this position and basically circumvented,"" said Roger Nordmann, leader of the Social Democrat group in the Swiss lower house told Reuters.

The Swiss government said it would take into account the rejection by parliament, but stressed the success of the takeover of Switzerland's second biggest bank - intended to prevent a financial meltdown - was paramount.

Industry experts said the deal was unlikely to be changed by politicians, with UBS being given a free hand to determine how many jobs will go and what will be done with Credit Suisse's valuable domestic retail banking business.

Swiss media has reported that the takeover could result in the combined bank cutting its Swiss workforce by up to 30%, which could cost 11,000 jobs.

""Despite the anger, most policy-makers do not want to interfere in the merger, to create and bear the risk that the merger does not succeed,"" said Hans Gersbach, co-director of the KOF economic research institute at ETH Zurich.

""Politicians might have wanted to show their disapproval about what happened, but they don’t want the UBS takeover to fail.""

Ultimately, 209 billion Swiss francs are being provided as state and central bank guarantees and support in the plan drawn up by the seven-strong Swiss cabinet, which has members from four political parties.

The amount is equivalent to around a quarter of Switzerland's entire economic output, and includes emergency liquidity injections and a state pledge to absorb up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS, based on documents outlining the deal.

Peter Kunz, an expert in economic law at the University of Bern, said the lawmakers were ultimately powerless to change it.

""In Switzerland, we often pat ourselves on the back for having the oldest democracy in the world. Yet seven people decided on 250 billion francs of support, an unimaginably huge sum of money,"" he said.

""And the parliament has no say in the matter. The use of such emergency legislation, overturning antitrust rules, is a problem for Swiss democracy and rule of law. It calls Swiss democracy into question.""

Sources say senior officials are reportedly reaching out to around 1,500 clients who lost a total 95 billion yen ($717 million) when Swiss regulators wrote down the value of Credit Suisse’s CS, +1.05% contingent convertible bonds –– also known as CoCo bonds or Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds –– last month.

American depositary receipts of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group MUFG, +0.78% were up almost 1% in Monday premarket trading.

The bonds were purchased through MUFG’s brokerage venture with Morgan Stanley MS, +1.19% , Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.

Of those 1,500 client accounts, 1,300 were held by individual investors and the rest were owned by corporations, according to a spokeswoman from Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities on Monday.

A spokesperson for the bank told Bloomberg that it is looking into whether wealth managers operating within the venture properly explained the risks of AT1 bonds.

Those bonds were designed to be risky and could be written down if a bank needs capital in an emergency. But when the Switzerland’s government wiped out the debt at Credit Suisse as part of a planned deal for the Swiss bank to be taken over by UBS UBS, +1.29% , some bondholders lashed out against the move and sought legal advice.

The move rocked the bond market and put the health of some European banks into the spotlight, with similar bonds at Deutsche Bank dropping in value after the event.

“We are very sorry that we are causing our clients concern,” Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley told Bloomberg. “We will continue to offer thorough explanations to the customers who have been affected.”

Data provided to Financial News by Morningstar shows net outflows from around 300 EU and US domiciled Credit Suisse CSGN, -2.76% CS, +1.05% funds have reached $5.6 billion over the three weeks since the tie-up.

The latest outflows will pile pressure on the merged firm; investors had already pulled around $3 billion from Credit Suisse funds in the week surrounding the shotgun wedding.

The latest figures show an additional $2.5 billion of net outflows from Credit Suisse funds between March 23 and April 6.

“It is fair to say that there is still uncertainty around the deal and the potential impact that it may have on Credit Suisse Asset Management,” Johann Scholtz, an equity analyst at Morningstar told FN.

Heavy outflows from Credit Suisse funds began on March 14, the day the bank said it had discovered “material weaknesses” in its financial reporting controls.

Credit Suisse declined to comment.

The largest daily outflows remain those recorded on March 21 — two days after the landmark deal was announced — when $776 million was pulled from Credit Suisse’s European funds.

Despite the steady outflows in recent weeks, the Morningstar figures show Credit Suisse’s European funds posted net inflows of more than $240 million over April 5 and April 6 — an early indication that investor jitters are starting to subside.

The flows data does not include all the asset manager’s funds in Europe and the U,S,, and represents only those funds that report daily figures to Morningstar.

Laith Khalaf, head of investments at online platform AJ Bell, said the bulk of fund outflows in the days surrounding the tie-up with UBS UBSG, -2.88% UBS, +1.29% was likely driven by investors worried about the stability of Credit Suisse and those spooked by wider banking sector turmoil.

“Those assets should be ring-fenced in the event of an insolvency, but investors might have decided that a belt-and-braces approach was required given the febrile market conditions at the time,” he said.

The $3.25 billion tie-up between UBS and Credit Suisse — the biggest merger between two systematically integral banks since the 2008 global financial crisis — also combined the banks’ respective asset management units, creating Europe’s largest money manager with $1.5 trillion.

UBS announced on March 29 that former boss Sergio Ermotti would return to oversee the merger. Ermotti, who stepped down as UBS chief in 2020 after nine years in the role, took over from Ralph Hamers at the start of April.

Analysts told FN last month that Ermotti would likely face significant challenges bringing together the two management arms, citing differences in corporate cultures, overlapping product ranges and technology issues.

Scholtz said some outflows in recent weeks may have been driven by Credit Suisse’s wealth management clients moving to other firms to “lower their concentration risk” if they are already using similar wealth products and services offered by UBS.

Similarly, some institutional investors with allocation to Credit Suisse funds may want to diversify if they are also UBS Asset Management clients, he said.

The collapse of Credit Suisse Group AG on March 19 into the arms of UBS Group AG resulted in $17 billion of the riskiest junior debt being wiped out, effectively closing the market. But insurance companies are cautiously reopening the market for new subordinated debt, paving the way for banks to eventually follow.



The writedown to zero delivered a seismic shock to the bank capital market, despite there being clear provisions in the prospectus. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group’s Inc.’s private clients lost more than $700 million on Credit Suisse’s riskiest bonds, Bloomberg News reported, underlining the global impact. Average yields in Europe’s secondary market are still around 11%, too expensive for most banks even if investor demand could be found.

Greed will inevitably overcome fear, though it might take a pause in central banks’ interest-rate hiking cycle to focus fund managers’ minds on what’s an acceptable yield to compensate for the risk of owning bonds that regulators might make worthless in the event of a bank collapse.



Banks are generally much better capitalized over the past decade, so most have sufficient breathing room before needing to raise new equity-related debt. But the regulatory requirement to have sufficient debt cover at all levels of the capital stack hasn’t gone away. That very much includes securities with risk of being bailed in, as that’s the base that supports the whole bank regulatory structure. The AT1 market must move on eventually — and the regulators will be keen for it to do so as an extended hiatus renders the system dysfunctional.","['Marcus Ashworth', 'Follow The Authors']",2023-04-17 00:00:00

NEW YORK, April 17, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bernstein Liebhard LLP, a nationally acclaimed investor rights law firm, reminds investors of the deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in a securities class action lawsuit that has been filed on behalf of investors who purchased or acquired the securities of Credit Suisse Group AG (“Credit Suisse” or the “Company”) (NYSE: CS) between March 10, 2022 and March 20, 2023, inclusive (the “Class Period”). The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Credit Suisse, together with its subsidiaries, provides various financial services in Switzerland, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Americas, and Asia Pacific. The Company offers wealth management solutions, including investment advice and discretionary asset management services; risk management solutions, such as managed investment products; and wealth planning, succession planning, and trust services.

In October 2022, Credit Suisse began experiencing a sharp increase in customer outflows, or withdrawals of client funds, after a series of quarterly losses and risk and compliance failures significantly decreased the Company’s American Depositary Share (“ADS”) price.

On December 1, 2022, Credit Suisse’s Chairman, Defendant Axel P. Lehmann (“Lehmann”), stated in an interview with Financial Times that customer outflows had not only “completely flattened out,” but had, in fact, “partially reversed.”

The following day, in an interview with Bloomberg Television, Defendant Lehmann reiterated his previous statements, reassuring investors that as of November 11, 2022, customer outflows had “basically stopped”.

Following Defendant Lehmann’s statements, Credit Suisse’s ADS price rose $0.29 per ADS, or 9.36%, to close at $3.38 per ADS on December 2, 2022.

Plaintiff alleges that Defendants made materially false and misleading statements throughout the Class Period. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants failed to disclose that: (i) contrary to Defendant Lehmann’s representations in December 2022, the sharp increase in customer outflows Credit Suisse began experiencing in October 2022 remained ongoing; (ii) accordingly, Credit Suisse had downplayed the impact of the Company’s recent series of quarterly losses and risk and compliance failures on liquidity and its ability to retain client funds; and (iii) as a result, Credit Suisse had overstated the Company’s financial position and/or prospects.

On February 9, 2023, Credit Suisse issued a press release announcing its 2022 financial results. The press release revealed that, contrary to Defendant Lehmann’s prior statements, large customer outflows had continued through year-end 2022. Specifically, the press release reported customer outflows of 110.5 billion Swiss francs in the final three months of 2022, a figure which far exceeded market expectations.

On this news, Credit Suisse’s ADS price fell $0.56 per ADS, or 15.64%, to close at $3.02 per ADS on February 9, 2023.

Then, on February 21, 2023, Reuters reported that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (“FINMA”) was reviewing Defendant Lehmann’s previous comments regarding customer outflows.

On this news, Credit Suisse’s ADS price fell another $0.10 per ADS, or 3.31%, to close at $2.92 per ADS on February 21, 2023.

GENEVA -- Switzerland's lower house of parliament issued a searing — though symbolic — rebuke Wednesday of an emergency plan spearheaded by the executive branch to prop up embattled Credit Suisse and shepherd it into a takeover by Swiss banking rival UBS.

The National Council, through an unusual left-right alliance, voted twice over the last day to reject government guarantees authorized last month of 100 billion Swiss francs (about $110 billion) to help keep Credit Suisse afloat and 9 billion francs to help UBS mop up any losses it may incur in the deal.

The votes took place in a special parliamentary session that wrapped up Wednesday to scrutinize long-running troubles at Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old bank that was a pillar of Swiss finance, and the government plan to save it from a collapse that could have shaken the global financial system.

Switzerland's main right-wing party opposed tighter regulations on banks, while centrists favored tougher rules but would accept state help for banks in some cases. Left-leaning parties that have long decried “overly dangerous” banks were insistent on stricter limits on bonuses for top executives and requirements for more money to be kept on hand by the biggest lenders.

""The whole discussion centered on whether more regulation was needed — in particular to the leverage ratio — and severely regulate bonuses of the managers of the big, systemically important banks,"" Socialist lawmaker Roger Nordmann said.

Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter, who has been at the epicenter of a political firestorm around the 3 billion franc ($3.25 billion) Credit Suisse-UBS deal, told lawmakers that capital requirements would be increased — and “you can start from the premise that big banks will face more severe restrictions.”

But Nordmann, who had questioned the minister on that issue, said by phone that Keller-Sutter hadn't presented any clear measures and was too noncommittal.

“That's an invitation for all dishonest bankers to come to Switzerland, and what we need is honest people,” he said.

The votes were symbolic because a parliamentary commission has already signed on to the emergency rescue plan that Swiss authorities orchestrated last month as shares of Credit Suisse sank and customers rushed to pull out their money. The failure of two U.S. banks just days before had sparked concerns about the stability of the Swiss lender and the global financial system.

Both the Swiss central bank and the government splashed out more than 200 billion Swiss francs in guarantees to help underpin the fusion of the country's top two banks and keep Credit Suisse from failing.

Parliament's upper house had voted Tuesday to accept the takeover plan announced March 19 by Switzerland’s seven-member executive branch — known as the Federal Council, which is headed by the Swiss president — as well as the Swiss National Bank and the financial markets regulator, FINMA.

Lawmakers in the upper house backed a plan that would have included limits to bonuses for bankers, but it didn't go far enough for the lower house.

For now, stricter legislative rules on Switzerland's biggest banks — led by UBS — are in limbo ahead of crucial elections for parliament this fall.",['Abc News'],

BERN, April 12 (Reuters) - The lower house of Switzerland's parliament voted late on Tuesday to retrospectively reject the 109 billion Swiss francs of financial guarantees the government gave to Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) as part of a hastily cobbled-together rescue package.

At an extraordinary government session called to discuss Credit Suisse's demise, 102 parliamentarians voted against the measure. Earlier on Tuesday, Switzerland's upper house voted in favor of the government guarantees.

The votes are, however, largely symbolic as the state has committed the funds and lawmakers cannot overturn that decision.

BERN, April 12 (Reuters) - Switzerland's parliament rejected on Wednesday the government's 109 billion Swiss francs ($120.82 billion) aid for Credit Suisse's (CSGN.S) merger with UBS (UBSG.S), leaving the fallen bank's hastily arranged rescue without a largely symbolic parliamentary blessing.

While the upper house had approved the government's contribution to the rescue package, parliament's lower, and larger chamber, pushed back again on Wednesday.

It had already rejected the proposals in a late night session on Tuesday, forcing the upper house to find a solution when it met again on Wednesday.

Seeking a compromise, the upper house passed changes to the measure on Wednesday morning, but it was not enough to sway the lower house lawmakers.

They turned it down by 103 votes to 71 in favour, a similar level of opposition to the night before.

Speaking just before the lower house vote, Cedric Wermuth, the co-president of the Social Democrats said the party just could not support the funding.

While the government's commitment, made using emergency law, cannot be overturned, the vote marks a symbolic rebuke for the authorities, whose decision to largely bypass the nation's legislative has angered many politicians.

""This decision has no impact on the takeover of Credit Suisse decided on March 19,"" the Swiss Finance Ministry said after the vote.

The support package had already been given binding approval by the parliament's finance delegation, due to the urgency of the matter, it said.

""The funds have already been fully committed,"" it added.

Lawmakers who backed an approval of the deal, voiced concern about Switzerland's image.

""It doesn't really matter what we decide in detail, but it would really send a bad signal if these loans were rejected,"" said Eva Herzog, who is a member of the Council of States, the upper house, before the vote.

Following a day of heated debates held in the country's four national languages, that continued into early morning hours, the upper house passed changes aimed at winning over the sceptics.

They included a proposal for Switzerland's federal government to draft an amendment to the country's Banking Act. Its aim would be to reduce the risks posed by systemically relevant banks, such as Credit Suisse and UBS for Switzerland, by, for example, raising capital requirements and restricting bonuses.

Addressing parliament before the vote on Wednesday, finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter told lawmakers to consider what message their rejection of the rescue would send to the world.

""What signal do you want to give internationally, are the institutions reliable, do you value financial market stability in a place where you already have a financial centre with a certain importance?""

Lawmakers were recalled to the country's capital, Bern, for the rare extraordinary session to discuss the Swiss government's open chequebook response to a collapse that many in the country have blamed on Credit Suisse's top management.

Last month's shotgun marriage which saw the bank taken over by rival UBS for 3 billion Swiss francs and propped up with more than 250 billion Swiss francs in guarantees and support has drawn widespread criticism.

The government invoked Swiss emergency law to sign it off to the ire of the almost 250 lawmakers left without a say.

""The use of emergency law has reached a level in the last three years that is beginning to annoy me,"" Hansjoerg Knecht, a member of Parliament's upper house, said on Tuesday.

Frustration in Switzerland over use of state funds

Lawmakers have protested, but cannot overturn deal















BERN, April 11 (Reuters) - Switzerland's parliament on Tuesday failed to approve the 109 billion Swiss francs ($120.5 billion) of financial guarantees used to rescue Credit Suisse last month, in a first-round vote that was largely symbolic given the state had committed the funds.

The lower house retrospectively rejected the rescue near midnight, with heated debates continuing into the early hours of Wednesday morning as members discussed other measures related to Credit Suisse.

Earlier on Tuesday, Switzerland's upper house had approved the rescue, meaning the two chambers of the legislative body will vote again on Wednesday.

Lawmakers were recalled for a rare extraordinary session to discuss the rapid rescue of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and the Swiss government's open chequebook response to a collapse that many in the country have blamed on top management.

A shotgun marriage which saw Credit Suisse taken over by Zurich-based rival UBS (UBSG.S) for 3 billion Swiss francs and propped up with more than 250 billion Swiss francs in guarantees and support has been the subject of widespread criticism.

While earlier in the day, 29 of Switzerland's 46-member Council of States upper house approved the measure, it was later rejected with 102 of the 200-Member National Council voting against it.

The votes are, however, largely symbolic because the state committed the funds and lawmakers cannot overturn that decision.

In the lead-up to the merger last month, Swiss emergency law was used so that a sub-group of six members of parliament approved the financial commitment on behalf of the legislative body, to the ire of the almost 250 lawmakers left without a say.

""The use of emergency law has reached a level in the last three years that is beginning to annoy me,"" Hansjoerg Knecht, a member of Parliament's upper house, said.

Calling the situation where the legislative body can only approve the already committed credits ""unsatisfactory"", Knecht said if Credit Suisse was to require more cash, there should be no use of emergency law to bypass parliament.

'LOTS OF QUESTIONS'

Switzerland's finance minister had addressed the Council of States before the vote and acknowledged the ire being voiced.

""I heard anger, I heard frustration, sometimes I also heard a bit of helplessness,"" Karin Keller-Sutter said, adding that the merger between historic cross-town rivals Credit Suisse and UBS was not a forced marriage, but one of convenience.

She also there needed to be a discussion around the kind of financial centre Switzerland wanted to be and whether it wanted to continue playing in the top league globally.

""What kind of consequences does this have for the financial regulator? For politics? These discussions need to be had. What do we really want and if we want that, we won't get there without carrying certain risk in future as well,"" she said.

A poll of Swiss economists found that nearly half thought the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS was not the best solution, warning the saga had dented Switzerland's reputation.

Celine Widmer, a Swiss National Council member for the left-leaning Social Democrats told Reuters ahead of the vote that ""lots of questions"" needed to be answered.

Politicians also questioned why the Swiss financial regulator was unable to prevent Credit Suisse's failure.

""Does FINMA need stronger instruments or have they done a bad job?"" Eva Herzog asked during a speech to the upper house.

Herzog is one of the six members of parliament who approved the rescue deal on behalf of the legislative body.

As part of the unusual event, the third such session in more than 20 years, the Swiss parliament had a chance to challenge the rushed rescue package and to discuss whether conditions could be imposed on Credit Suisse.

Last week, Switzerland announced it was cutting bonus payments for Credit Suisse's top management.

Credit Suisse's rescue angered not only politicians but many in Switzerland. A survey by political research firm gfs.bern found a majority of Swiss did not support the deal.

There are also growing worries about jobs and in an open letter to parliament, the Swiss Bank Employees' Association said that Credit Suisse and UBS must freeze any cuts.

(Alessandro della Valle/Keystone via AP)

GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland’s lower house of parliament issued a searing — though symbolic — rebuke Wednesday of an emergency plan spearheaded by the executive branch to prop up embattled Credit Suisse and shepherd it into a takeover by Swiss banking rival UBS .

The National Council, through an unusual left-right alliance, voted twice over the last day to reject government guarantees authorized last month of 100 billion Swiss francs (about $110 billion) to help keep Credit Suisse afloat and 9 billion francs to help UBS mop up any losses it may incur in the deal.

The votes took place in a special parliamentary session that wrapped up Wednesday to scrutinize long-running troubles at Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old bank that was a pillar of Swiss finance, and the government plan to save it from a collapse that could have shaken the global financial system.

Switzerland’s main right-wing party opposed tighter regulations on banks, while centrists favored tougher rules but would accept state help for banks in some cases. Left-leaning parties that have long decried “overly dangerous” banks were insistent on stricter limits on bonuses for top executives and requirements for more money to be kept on hand by the biggest lenders.

“The whole discussion centered on whether more regulation was needed — in particular to the leverage ratio — and severely regulate bonuses of the managers of the big, systemically important banks,” Socialist lawmaker Roger Nordmann said.

Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter, who has been at the epicenter of a political firestorm around the 3 billion franc ($3.25 billion) Credit Suisse-UBS deal , told lawmakers that capital requirements would be increased — and “you can start from the premise that big banks will face more severe restrictions.”

But Nordmann, who had questioned the minister on that issue, said by phone that Keller-Sutter hadn’t presented any clear measures and was too noncommittal.

“That’s an invitation for all dishonest bankers to come to Switzerland, and what we need is honest people,” he said.

The votes were symbolic because a parliamentary commission has already signed on to the emergency rescue plan that Swiss authorities orchestrated last month as shares of Credit Suisse sank and customers rushed to pull out their money. The failure of two U.S. banks just days before had sparked concerns about the stability of the Swiss lender and the global financial system.

Both the Swiss central bank and the government splashed out more than 200 billion Swiss francs in guarantees to help underpin the fusion of the country’s top two banks and keep Credit Suisse from failing.

Parliament’s upper house had voted Tuesday to accept the takeover plan announced March 19 by Switzerland’s seven-member executive branch — known as the Federal Council, which is headed by the Swiss president — as well as the Swiss National Bank and the financial markets regulator, FINMA.

Lawmakers in the upper house backed a plan that would have included limits to bonuses for bankers, but it didn’t go far enough for the lower house.

https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-pays-back-some-emergency-liquidity-central-bank-data-suggests-2023-04-11/,"Credit Suisse pays back some emergency liquidity, central bank data suggests","













ZURICH, April 11 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) has already paid back some of the emergency liquidity offered by the Swiss National Bank (SNB), data suggested on Tuesday, signaling an ebbing of the liquidity crisis which triggered the lender's fall.

Sight deposits - cash held by commercial banks overnight with the SNB - fell by 31 billion Swiss francs ($34.3 billion)last week, data published by the central bank showed.

The drop was the second-biggest weekly decline on record, second only to when the SNB started mopping up market liquidity after it quit negative interest rates last September.

In recent weeks sight deposits have soared as Credit Suisse received emergency liquidity infusions to head off a bank run as nervous customers pulled out their cash.

The lender last month said it intended to borrow up to 50 billion francs from the SNB in a last-ditch attempt to save itself after confidence evaporated following a string of blunders.

Following a state-sponsored takeover by rival UBS (UBSG.S), another 200 billion francs in liquidity was also made available by the SNB.

As a result sight deposits rose from 515 billion in mid March to peak at 567 billion francs as the SNB deposited the cash with Credit Suisse, an upward trend which reversed last week as sight deposits fell to 532 billion francs.

Credit Suisse, the SNB and UBS declined to comment on the development.

Karsten Junius, an economist at J.Safra Sarasin, said the decline could be attributed to Credit Suisse paying back some of the emergency liquidity it took and no longer needing to draw on the central bank support.

""Confidence in the bank has been restored by the UBS merger, and from this data it would appear customer outflows have stopped,"" Junius said.

""A bank run has been stopped by the SNB coming in and offering massive liquidity and customers are reassured by UBS being there too. Credit lines from other banks would also appear to have been re-established.""

The SNB may also have been active in forex markets, selling some of its foreign currencies to prop up the franc, an activity which would have seen sight deposits decline as the SNB received francs from commercial banks in return.

But this was likely to be minor, Junius said, saying the SNB only sold foreign currencies worth 27 billion in the last three months of 2022.

""It's extremely unlikely the SNB sold more than 30 billion of forex just last week,"" Junius said. ""Confidence has been restored – the rescue seems to have done the trick. It seems to have been a successful operation.""

GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland’s parliament opened a special session Tuesday to scrutinize the state-imposed takeover of Swiss bank Credit Suisse by rival UBS — and consider strengthening the legal arsenal to better gird against financial blowups .

The debate could run up to three days, with lawmakers voicing — and needing to iron out — disagreements over the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.25 billion) fusion of Switzerland’s top two banks , a thunderclap for a country that prides itself on finesse and acumen in finance.

Swiss authorities stepped in as shares of Credit Suisse plunged last month and depositors pulled their money after the failure of two U.S. banks sparked concerns about the stability of global financial system and the long-troubled lender. Credit Suisse is among 30 “globally systemically important banks,” and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

“The situation on the financial markets has calmed down, but it is not fully stabilized, and our country — Switzerland — has emerged shaken by this painful episode ,” Swiss President Alain Berset said at the session.

He said lawmakers would need to ensure that the legal framework was “as solid as possible to prevent this kind of crisis from happening again.” The executive branch also would look into “too big to fail” rules for key banks passed after the 2008 global financial crisis that may need changing, Berset added.

Lawmakers also are considering accountability for Credit Suisse and concerns about thousands of expected job cuts and looking at state-backed guarantees of over $100 billion aimed at holding the bank together until the merger is completed and buttressing UBS against possible losses .

They also are debating what it will mean for Switzerland to have one giant bank .

Johanna Gapany, a centrist lawmaker and rapporteur for the upper chamber’s finance commission, said the parliamentary panel had made three main proposals: change competition rules in light of the emergence of megabank UBS , examine how Credit Suisse executives might be held accountable and block the executive branch from unilaterally releasing more emergency funds for the rescue plan.

The proposals showed a “clear intention to not only prevent this situation from happening again, but to make sure that the solution protects the interests of citizens as much as possible — thus by taking the least risk with the guarantees that have been provided,” Gapany said.

ADVERTISEMENT

Despite the talk, few concrete results were expected from the session, which is primarily to flesh out ideas — and possibly some vitriol — from lawmakers who all face reelection this fall.

Yvan Lengwiler, an economics professor at the University of Basel, suggested that the debate would play into a longtime “tug-of-war” between lawmakers who have lobbied in favor of Swiss banks over the years and others who have long sought to stiffen regulation.

“It seems that the pendulum, after this debacle we’ve seen, has clearly shifted towards strengthening,” he said. “Two years from now … the political situation might be very different, and it could be quite difficult to get this through parliament.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Jakob Stark, an upper-house lawmaker from the populist, right-wing Swiss People’s Party, said the rescue of Credit Suisse was “was probably right and ultimately unavoidable” but that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority — known as FINMA — must become ”more decisive.”

“It should, for instance, get the authority to impose fines, but then it should also really impose the fines, and particularly on the big institutions,” Stark said of the regulator. “My feeling is that it was too considerate toward Credit Suisse, perhaps because of a legal basis that wasn’t sufficiently clear.”

The Swiss attorney general’s office has already opened a probe into events surrounding Credit Suisse ahead of the takeover, and the executive branch last week ordered tens of millions in cuts to the bonuses of top Credit Suisse executives.

Lawmakers largely were expected to line up behind the rescue plan — even if reluctantly for some — and were not yet expected to authorize a parliamentary investigation of the epochal rescue of Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old pillar of Swiss banking.

ADVERTISEMENT

Lengwiler, who specializes in financial market regulation, noted that the combined bank will have a balance sheet that will be twice as large as Switzerland’s annual economy.

That’s nothing new: Both Credit Suisse and UBS had bigger balance sheets than the Swiss economy before the 2008 financial crisis. But this combined bank will be unprecedented in size and heft, presenting new challenges for government officials.

“What’s new here is that it’s the only kid on the block now,” Lengwiler said. “UBS is really the only game in town and … has become extremely dominant, and that is a problem for Switzerland.”

“It’s maybe too large for the country,” he added.

https://www.ips-journal.eu/topics/economy-and-ecology/the-failure-of-credit-suisse-6635/,The failure of Credit Suisse,"In the wake of the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse (CS), the narrative that the two banks were special cases – so one could therefore return to business as usual – quickly gained ground. On closer inspection, however, this is far from being valid, at least for CS.

True, the bank has a long history of mismanagement: involvement with the Bulgarian mafia from 2004 to 2007, dubious dealings involving a British subsidiary in Mozambique in 2011 and losses at the hedge funds Archegos and Greensill in 2021. And it is probably not wrong to report a ‘general rip-off mentality’ among its managers.

Under supervision

Recent problems should not, however, be reduced to past mistakes – or excessive management remuneration. The bank was not operating in a vacuum: it was under the constant supervision and monitoring of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB). In the event of chronic concerns, it was up to these institutions to urge remedial action.

Yet, in its financial-stability report last September, referring also to UBS, the SNB declared:

Despite all the mismanagement, the CS annual report published last month showed the bank still had 45 bn Swiss francs in equity at the end of 2022.

The capital position of both banks has improved further since the last Financial Stability Report. The capital ratios of Credit Suisse and UBS exceed the requirements under the Swiss ‘too big to fail’ regulations and are above average by international comparison. The report also presented very positively the outcomes of stress tests conducted by the SNB: ‘the results of the stress scenario analysis indicate that, thanks to their capital buffers, the two globally active Swiss banks are well placed to cope with severely adverse developments in economic and financial conditions.’

And despite all the mismanagement, the CS annual report published last month showed the bank still had 45 bn Swiss francs in equity at the end of 2022. Its auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, confirmed in that report that everything was in order. Since CS was sold to UBS shortly afterwards for only 3 bn Swiss francs, the question arises as to how such a massive loss in value – in less than three months – might be explained.

The problem lies with the authorities

What were the real causes of the bank’s collapse? There is no doubt it was triggered by massive withdrawals by depositors who feared losing their money in the face of so much negative news. But this was also addressed by the SNB in its stability report. In the event of ‘liquidity shocks’, it said it would provide additional liquidity, in its capacity as ‘lender of last resort’, against sufficient collateral.

This corresponds to the textbook procedure for a banking crisis, based on distinguishing solvency and liquidity problems. A bank that is insolvent, being over-indebted, must be closed or restructured immediately. A solvent bank, on the other hand, which becomes illiquid due to a withdrawal of deposits triggered by psychological factors, presents a scenario for the central bank to step in as a lender of last resort. As long as the bank is sufficiently capitalised, the central bank should be able to keep it alive with liquidity assistance.

The fundamental problem, therefore, is that the Swiss authorities were not able to rescue CS, despite their statements to the contrary.

If the accounts are correct, CS was a solvent bank with above-average capital adequacy, at least until the end of 2022. As late as 15 March 2023, the SNB and FINMA explicitly affirmed that CS met the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks. If necessary, the SNB would provide liquidity.

The fundamental problem, therefore, is that the Swiss authorities were not able to rescue CS, despite their statements to the contrary, resulting in a huge loss of capital for shareholders and subordinated debt holders. For Switzerland, this raises the question of how to reform its authorities, which were incapable of recognising the bank’s problems and ensuring its survival, so that they may adequately supervise the new, extra-large UBS and effectively stabilise it in the event of a run.

A threat to global markets?

Beyond Switzerland, the collapse of CS shows that even an above-average capital base is no guarantee of a bank’s stability in a crisis – and that stress tests, however important, should not be overestimated. If the Swiss authorities were unable to deal with a serious liquidity problem, moreover, couldn’t something similar happen in other countries?

So there is still no reason to sound the all-clear on global financial markets. The abrupt rise in central-bank policy rates since last year is a major challenge for the banking system. During the years of low interest rates, many institutions were generous in granting long-term loans, especially for housing, which are now yielding low returns. At the same time, they have been refinancing themselves with very short-term deposits.

As long as depositors remain calm, this is not a problem. But if confidence in a bank wanes, the only way for it to attract new funds is to pay the currently very high short-term interest rates for them. A liquidity problem can then quickly become a solvency issue. This creates a conflict of objectives for central banks. Still unchecked ‘core’ inflation (excluding energy and food) argues for maintenance of a restrictive monetary policy, but this increases tensions in the financial system.

Customers can certainly monitor their pizza bakers, but when it comes to banks, depositors are no more able to monitor the safety of the service than are the passengers of an airline.

This trade-off cannot be resolved, but central banks can mitigate it by working with governments to make clear that solvent institutions can count on full liquidity support. In particular, the scope of government deposit insurance could be increased, at least temporarily, to reduce the risk of destabilising withdrawals in the first place.

Given the complexity of global financial institutions, the more fundamental question arises as to how outsiders entrusting their money to a bank should be able to judge its quality and so impose what the literature calls ‘market discipline’. The World Bank defines this thus: ‘market discipline refers to the process by which market participants, such as depositors and shareholders, monitor banks’ risks and take action to limit excessive risk-taking.’

Customers can certainly monitor their pizza bakers, but when it comes to banks, depositors are no more able to monitor the safety of the service than are the passengers of an airline. The design of institutional arrangements that provide absolutely safe assets for large depositors is therefore an open question.

The option of holding deposits directly with the central bank – a central-bank digital currency – would be very welcome. But so far, the European Central Bank’s plans for a digital euro envisage an upper limit of only € 3,000, to avoid the bypassing (‘disintermediation’) of the banking system.

https://www.dw.com/en/swiss-parliament-symbolically-rejects-credit-suisse-rescue/a-65295389,Swiss parliament symbolically rejects Credit Suisse rescue – DW – 04,"The government's deal for UBS to buyout troubled Credit Suisse has been rejected by lawmakers. The vote is merely symbolic, however, as the deal went through under an emergency law.

The Swiss lower house of parliament voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday against the 100 billion Swiss francs (roughly $110 billion or €100 billion) rescue package that saw banking giant UBS taking over its rival Credit Suisse.

The rebuke is, however, only symbolic, with the money already having been signed off by the Swiss government via an emergency law.

""This decision has no impact on the takeover of Credit Suisse decided on March 19,"" the Swiss Finance Ministry said after the vote.

""On March 19, 2023, the Finance Delegation of the Swiss Parliament had already given its binding approval to the commitment credits on behalf of Parliament due to the urgency of the matter,"" it said.

Rejection sends a 'bad signal'

Wednesday's vote came after the upper house offered amendments to sweeten the deal following previous failed votes.

It saw parties from the right and the left wings of the parliament come together in a rare voting bloc, with the final tally at 103-71.

The government's decision to push through the rescue package has angered many in a country that is used to frequent referendums on a variety of policy issues.

Despite the mere symbolism of Wednesday's vote, the attempt by the upper house to seek a compromise makes clear how much the government had hoped to secure the legislature's retrospective approval.

""It doesn't really matter what we decide in detail, but it would really send a bad signal if these loans were rejected,"" Eva Herzog, a member of the Council of States, the upper house, said before the vote.

Why did the Swiss government orchestrate the Credit Suisse buyout?

The Swiss government negotiated the UBS buyout of Credit Suisse in order to prevent the 167-year-old banking institution from collapsing and possibly triggering further crashes across the global banking system.

UBS agreed to pay 3 billion Swiss francs to take on its troubled rival but on the condition of billions more in guarantees from the Swiss central bank.

The government may have prevented further banking troubles with its rescue deal, but Wednesday's vote represents disapproval of the move ahead of legislative elections set to take place this October.

SBPV managing director Natalia Ferrara has written to lawmakers to demand they consider staff affected by the collapse of Credit Suisse and halt any job losses until the end of 2023.

""We ... call on you to support our demand for a freeze on layoffs by the end of 2023 in parliament,"" Ferrara wrote in the letter published by newspaper Blick on Monday.

""Politicians must not shirk responsibility,"" she added.

The Swiss parliament is due to meet in extraordinary session on Tuesday to discuss the state-sponsored rescue of Credit Suisse which took place last month.

UBS agreed to buy Zurich rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.31 billion) in a deal engineered by the government, the central bank and market regulator to avoid a meltdown in the country's financial system.

""For the past three weeks, many of the approximately 17,000 employees at Credit Suisse and the 22,000 UBS employees have been looking at their future with uncertainty,"" said Ferrara, referring to the staff numbers in Switzerland.

Credit Suisse employs 45,000 people globally, while UBS has 74,000 in total.

""In the public debate about the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, there is a lot of talk about numbers, money, regulation, 'too big to fail' or bonuses,"" Ferrara wrote.

""But the affected employees of the two banks remain only a side note.

""That needs to change.""

UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti last week warned there would be ""change and hard decisions"" ahead following the takeover.

The giant bank created could reduce its workforce by 20%-30%, it has been reported by Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger, with 11,000 jobs being cut in Switzerland.

UBS has said it is too early to speculate on job cuts.

Ferrara said it was not the fault of the bank employees that the rescue was required, adding it would take months for UBS's plans to be worked out.

""Now it is time for the affected employees of the two banks to be given protection and respect,"" Ferrara wrote.

""It must not be the case that parliament debates money and technical aspects of the CS rescue for days during the extraordinary session and the people affected are forgotten."" ($1 = 0.9069 Swiss francs)",[],2023-04-11 00:00:00
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ubs-mulls-keeping-credit-suisse-154135669.html,UBS Mulls Keeping Credit Suisse Private Wealth Unit Targeting India's Wealthy Diaspora,"UBS Group AG (NYSE: UBS) is reportedly looking to retain Credit Suisse Group AG's (NYSE: CS) private banking unit in India, making way for a potential return to the market.

In recent weeks, Iqbal Khan, global head of wealth management at UBS, met with counterparts at Credit Suisse, including the lender's local wealth head Puneet Matta in Singapore, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter.

The move would give the Swiss lender a stronger foothold among the growing ranks of Indian billionaires while underscoring a return for Khan, who steered the private wealth business during his time at Credit Suisse before joining UBS in 2019.

Credit Suisse has around 40 wealth management employees in India and around 7,000 people. According to the bank's website, India is the second-largest footprint for Credit Suisse outside of Switzerland.

The considerations aren't final, the people said. UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment on the report to Bloomberg.

By 2014, UBS had opted to exit India's private-wealth market.

In recent months, UBS has already hired several Credit Suisse private bankers in Singapore to target India's wealthy client portfolio, including Gautam Anand, a managing director.

The $3.2 billion central-bank-brokered deal will shut off most of Credit Suisse's investment banking.

UBS Group also announced elimination of about 20 to 30% of jobs worldwide amid the takeover.

https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/ubs-can-score-quick-win-with-swiss-sale-2023-04-12/,UBS can score a quick win with Swiss sale,"













LONDON, April 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Credit Suisse’s (CSGN.S) Swiss business is theoretically the jewel in the bank’s tarnished crown. But for UBS (UBSG.S) Chair Colm Kelleher, getting rid of his rival’s local unit may nonetheless be the least-bad option.

A key appeal of UBS’s state-backed emergency rescue of its struggling peer is the chance to axe expenses. Meshing Credit Suisse’s local bank – which serves retail, corporate and wealthy clients in Switzerland – with UBS’s equivalent division could generate $1.5 billion of annual savings, according to RBC analysts. Those could have a net present value of $9.5 billion, after factoring in tax and restructuring costs, according to a Breakingviews calculation.

Yet the savings could easily disappoint. Swiss clients of both UBS and Credit Suisse may decide to spread their risk by moving some business elsewhere, rather than sticking entirely with the newly created behemoth. RBC analysts reckon these so-called dis-synergies could lead to a $1.4 billion loss of revenue in Switzerland, or roughly one-third of the Credit Suisse unit’s 2022 top line.

UBS also risks inflaming opposition to the deal, which will create a giant with 29% of total Swiss deposits and may lead to job losses and branch closures in the country. Politicians, who debated the takeover in an emergency session on Tuesday, can’t block it. But after the 2008 crisis, many governments punished banks by imposing taxes and pay restrictions. Swiss solvency rules already include add-ons linked to market share, meaning UBS may in future have to fund the combined domestic business with more capital than if the two divisions were separate.

Hiving off the Credit Suisse local unit could save Kelleher and his Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti a lot of grief. It may also generate a handsome payday, which could help speed up the rest of the merger integration. The legal entity that houses much of Credit Suisse’s domestic business last year made about a 9% return on $14 billion of shareholder’s equity, according to Breakingviews calculations. That justifies a valuation of perhaps $11 billion, assuming a conservative 12% cost of equity. By contrast, UBS is paying just $3.6 billion for all of Credit Suisse, based on the buyer’s most recent share price.

The tricky part would be how to structure a deal. Kelleher could in theory just hand the Credit Suisse local division to shareholders, but that could prove destabilising if they all cash out immediately. Another option is to raise funds by listing a chunk of the shares, and sell the rest over time. It helps that most of Credit Suisse’s domestic business is already in a carved-out unit with its own capital and funding requirements.

True, a sale or listing would add one more complication to an already tricky deal. But it has to be simpler than a lengthy and politically fraught integration.

CONTEXT NEWS

Switzerland’s parliament on April 11 failed to approve the 109 billion Swiss francs ($120.5 billion) of financial guarantees used to rescue Credit Suisse in a deal with UBS last month, in a first-round vote that was largely symbolic.

The lower house retrospectively rejected the rescue at close to midnight, with heated debates continuing into the early hours of April 12. Earlier on April 11, Switzerland’s upper house had approved the rescue, meaning the two chambers of the legislative body will vote again.

The votes are, however, largely symbolic because the state committed the funds and lawmakers cannot overturn that decision.

UBS will rescue Credit Suisse in a deal worth about 3 billion Swiss francs, Swiss authorities and the two banks said on March 19.

Yet if any of the 1,700 who entered Zurich’s Hallenstadion on April 4th for the firm’s final annual general meeting were relieved, they did not show it. Tickets to the historic event were cheap: the terms of the rescue deal, which was agreed without a shareholder vote, valued Credit Suisse’s shares at a mere SFr0.76 ($0.84).

Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the <audio> element.

Opening eulogies were delivered by Axel Lehmann, the firm’s chairman, and Ulrich Körner, its chief executive. Votes to award bosses extra pay and absolve them of blame for actions taken during the past financial year were scrapped, along with the bank’s dividend. Five members of the board did not seek re-election. The remaining seven have the unenviable task of guiding the bank through its twilight months before the deal closes later this year. Although Glass Lewis, a proxy adviser, and Norges Bank, a big shareholder, opposed Mr Lehmann’s re-election, he was spared the boot in the shareholder vote.

The arena transformed into a court when shareholders took their turn to speak. Some counselled Mr Lehmann on the many failures of his bank’s recent history. Others were inconsolable. One joked that he had not brought his gun to the meeting. Another wondered if the firm’s bosses might have been crucified for their actions in the Middle Ages. A man graced the podium with a fistful of empty walnut shells. Younger attendees wandered the rows with bags of chocolate, wearing branded t -shirts destined for the ghoulish market in financial-disaster memorabilia.

Unsurprisingly, no representative from Saudi National Bank, Credit Suisse’s largest shareholder, took to the lectern. The chaos of recent months has slashed the value of its SFr1.4bn investment by four-fifths and sunk the career of its chairman, whose inelegant comments about the bank on March 15th contributed to the ensuing loss of confidence.

Instead, a sea of largely Swiss shareholders shook their heads in unison. Non-institutional Swiss owners represent 87% of Credit Suisse’s total, even if they hold a fifth of registered shares. Many are furious at the death of the 167-year-old institution. One poll found more than three-quarters of Swiss people, angry at the level of state support, want the deal undone. Discomfort might grow as ubs begins an integration process likely to claim thousands of jobs. Legal wrangles will not help: on April 2nd Switzerland’s federal prosecutor announced a probe into the activity of those involved in the deal; the next day, lawyers representing holders of Credit Suisse’s Additional-Tier 1 bonds announced possible litigation to recover their losses.

Bosses at ubs , which was due to hold its own meeting as we published this on April 5th, will have taken note of the mood. If nothing else, they will ponder the deterrent effect of the occasional public drubbing for managers. For Credit Suisse, holding its first in-person meeting in four years, it came too late. ■

A group of about 30 investors in Singapore, which includes individual investors and family offices, are seeking to sue the Swiss government over Credit Suisse's AT1 bond wipeout, according to a «Straits Times» report.

The group is currently speaking to law firms WilmerHale and Engelin Teh Practice.

Accredited investors and family offices in Singapore as well as other parts of Asia are likely to account for a sizeable part of losses with some $750 million of Credit Suisse’s AT1 bonds denominated in Singapore dollars.

EFTA Agreement

According to the Swiss government, the 16 billion francs ($18 billion) devaluation was justified as an emergency law was passed to authorize the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (Finma) to take such action.

But Credit Suisse’s bondholders in Singapore argue that the move had breached their rights protected under the Singapore-European Free Trade Association (EFTA) free trade agreement signed in 2003 which involves the city-state and a bloc of four countries, including Switzerland.

Under this agreement, Singapore investors have some unique protections that require «fair and equitable» treatment of foreign investors, according to WilmerHale partner Jonathan Lim, since AT1 debt typically ranks higher than shares on the capital structure.",[],2023-04-17 09:01:35

Weight-loss drug Wegovy has had a successful relaunch after dealing with supply issues, while diabetes drug Ozempic has seen accelerating growth instead of moderation following Wegovy's relaunch, analyst Dominic Lunn said in a note to clients. ""Rx trends for both Ozempic and Wegovy YTD have been a major surprise and have significantly outperformed our expectations,"" he wrote. NVO YTD mountain U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk Both drugs have catapulted into the spotlight thanks to the success they have shown in weight loss and the endorsement by celebrities and social media influencers. Only Wegovy, however, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for weight loss. Ozempic is authorized to treat diabetes, although it is being used off-label for weight loss. Both medications are semaglutide, but Wegovy is a higher dose. The run on Wegovy prompted a shortage last year, causing some patients to switch to Ozempic. Now that Wegovy is back in supply, Credit Suisse had expected a potential slowdown in growth for Ozempic. Instead, while there has been a rise in new patients taking Wegovy, Ozempic is continuing to see growth, Dunn said. ""In our view, these latest trends visibly take 2023 estimates beyond Novo's current growth guidance and consensus expectations, although we understand buy-side expectations are already significantly ahead of published sell-side forecasts,"" he said. Recent total prescription trends have Ozempic growing 100% year over year, he said. Semaglutide is part of a class of drugs called glucagon-like peptide 1, or GLP-1, which only has 22% penetration in diabetes in the U.S., Dunn said. ""Novo sees growth being driven by penetration in diabetes rather than off-label obesity use, which is backed up by the fact the Ozempic growth has accelerated despite re-supply of Wegovy for Obesity,"" he said. Meanwhile, Credit Suisse has increased its Wegovy sales forecasts by more than 100% thanks to the drug's rapid growth since its relaunch. While Eli Lilly 's Mounjaro has shown better results than Wegovy when it comes to weight loss, Mounjaro is still only approved for diabetes.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse















ZURICH, April 8 (Reuters) - UBS's (UBSG.S) multi-billion state-sponsored takeover of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) should proceed smoothly without political obstructions, Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said in an interview published on Saturday.

The Swiss parliament is due to hold an extraordinary session next week to discuss the emergency merger engineered by the Swiss authorities after Credit Suisse came close to collapse.

Nearly 260 billion Swiss francs ($287 billion) of liquidity support and state guarantees have been offered to back the takeover and avoid a financial meltdown the bank's uncontrolled failure could have triggered.

""There is a merger agreement between UBS and CS, for its part the cabinet has made a commitment to the national bank to provide CS with liquidity in order to ensure stability,"" Keller-Sutter told newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft.

""The guarantee agreement with UBS is still being negotiated. In many committee meetings, I got the impression that politicians definitely don't want to jeopardise the takeover,"" she added.

""I don't see any stumbling blocks at the moment.""

Completing the merger was the highest priority, the minister said, who defended the government's intervention last month, which critics have said came too late and promised too much taxpayer support for a bank that paid out billions in bonuses to executives.

""The primary goal of the Federal Council was to ensure the stability of the Swiss economy and the Swiss financial center and to prevent an international financial crisis,"" she said.

""Under the circumstances, it was and is the best possible choice, which also places the least burden on the state and the taxpayer,"" Keller-Sutter said.

The new combined bank will have $1.6 trillion in assets - double the size of the entire Swiss economy - and more than 120,000 staff and Keller-Sutter said the structure of UBS would have to be considered in the future.

""UBS will have to hold more equity after the takeover. This will rather force them to shrink,"" Keller-Sutter said.

Switzerland's Competition Commission can also make recommendations, the minister added.

The risks to the taxpayer were also acceptable - even though the government could assume up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS by the takeover.

Keller-Sutter criticised the culture at Credit Suisse, which she said had set the wrong incentives and had not learned from previous scandals and prosecutions.

The minister also defended the writedown of AT1 bonds to zero, a controversial part of the rescue.

""These are high-risk bonds with high yields, sometimes over 9%,"" Keller-Sutter said. ""The prospectus for these bonds makes it clear that if a company claims indirect government aid, they can be written off.""

The special parliamentary session next week was important, she added, and a welcome opportunity to get to the truth of the Credit Suisse debacle.

""At the moment, parliament can 'only' advise on the commitment credit, but it also has the opportunity to comment on the case and play an active role in the process.""

Switzerland has long been a preferred place for the world's wealthy to stash their cash. But, one of the country's biggest and oldest banks, Credit Suisse, collapsed over the weekend, forcing the Swiss government to broker a deal that saw rival UBS buy the bank for $3.2 billion.

https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2023/04/credit-suisse-switzerland-job-cuts,Credit Suisse's Swiss bankers think Oswald might save them,"When Credit Suisse and UBS complete their merger in around four years time, over 30,000 of their combined employees will have disappeared, 11,000 of them in Switzerland. Faced with this fate, Credit Suisse's Swiss insiders are hoping that a familiar figure will rescue them.

The fervent rumour in Zurich is that Oswald Grübel, the veteran German banker who was once CEO of UBS (2009-2011) and who spent nearly three decades at Credit Suisse, where he was at one point co-chief executive, has a plan. Grübel's plan, which may be entirely spurious but which is being discussed by hopeful Credit Suisse MDs, is thought to involve Christoph Blocher, a Swiss billionaire and member of parliament.

""There are rumours that they're putting together a bid to buy Credit Suisse's Swiss business from UBS,"" says one Credit Suisse insider, referring to Grübel and Blocher. ""Credit Suisse's Swiss universal bank could be sold for a lot more than UBS paid for it.""

After UBS acquired Credit Suisse, Grübel, who is in his 70s, but is a known workaholic with a passion for Aston Martins, told the FT, it was ""shocking to lose a 167-year-old bank in 72 hours.” In late December, Grübel declared that Credit Suisse was on safe ground after buying shares in the bank in October.

Blocher, meanwhile, has made his opposition to the UBS/Credit Suisse merger clear, stating that it would be ""a bad thing for the Swiss workplace, especially for bank customers.""

Credit Suisse insiders say the merger with UBS was the worst possible outcome for Swiss staff. ""Julius Baer would have been our preferred partner,"" says one. ""Credit Suisse could have brought their institutional and corporate clients to Julius Baer, plus a much more sophisticated markets business. It would have been a far more complementary merger.""

https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/business/swiss-prosecutor-probe-credit-suisse/index.html,Swiss prosecutor probes Credit Suisse takeover,"Switzerland’s Federal Prosecutor has opened an investigation into the state-backed takeover of Credit Suisse (AMJL) by UBS Group, the office of the attorney general said Sunday.

The prosecutor, based in the Swiss capital Bern, is looking into potential breaches of the country’s criminal law by government officials, regulators and executives at the two banks, which agreed on an emergency merger last month to avoid a meltdown in the country’s financial system.

There were “numerous aspects of events around Credit Suisse” that warranted investigation and which needed to be analyzed to “identify any criminal offenses that could fall within the competence of the [prosecutor],” it said in a statement.

“The Office of the Attorney General wants to proactively fulfill its mandate and responsibility to contribute to a clean Swiss financial center and has set up a monitoring system so that it can take action immediately on any issues that fall within its area of responsibility,” it added.

It gave no indication of any specific aspects of the merger agreement it might look into or how long the investigation might last.

Both UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment.

Out of the ordinary

“It’s astonishing that the prosecutor would comment,” said Mark Pieth, professor emeritus of the University of Basel, where he has taught criminal law and criminology. But the rescue “is so out of the ordinary that they had to say something.”

Pieth said the prosecutor could be probing breaches of secrecy provisions by officials, or the trading on inside information, adding that the wiping out of some bondholders as planned under the deal is also problematic.

In the deal announced March 19 and orchestrated by the Swiss government, the central bank and market regulator, UBS would acquire rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion). The bank is trying to close the deal by as soon as the end of April, sources have told Reuters.

The Swiss public and politicians have voiced concerns about the level of state support, with nearly 260 billion Swiss francs in liquidity and guarantees offered by the government and Swiss National Bank.

A poll of Swiss economists found that nearly half think the takeover of Credit Suisse was not the best solution. They warned that the situation had dented Switzerland’s reputation as a banking center.

The takeover, which was also designed to help secure financial stability globally during a period of turmoil, has sparked concern among critics about the size of the merged bank, with $1.6 trillion in assets and more than 120,000 staff worldwide.

Up to 30% of staff could lose their jobs due to the takeover, according to an unnamed senior UBS manager quoted in Swiss media.",[],2023-04-02 00:00:00

https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/05/business/credit-suisse-bonus-cuts/index.html,Switzerland cuts bonus payouts for top Credit Suisse management,"CNN —

BERLIN -— Switzerland has instructed Credit Suisse to cancel or reduce all outstanding bonus payments for the top three levels of management and examine whether those already paid can be recovered, the Federal Council said on Wednesday.

Under Swiss banking law, the Federal Council can impose bonus-related measures on a systemically important bank if it received state aid from federal funds, according to a statement.

The highly unusual government move comes after a public backlash against bonus payments at the bank, which was forced into a merger with rival UBS and had to be rescued with close to 260 billion Swiss francs ($280 billion) of state funding and guarantees.

The decision “will affect around 1,000 employees, who will be deprived of approximately 50-60 million Swiss francs with these measures,” the council said.

Bonus payments up to the end of 2022 will be canceled for the Executive Board, and then halved for management one level below the board and reduced by 25% for those two levels below.

The bank’s top executives had already announced they were not taking a bonus for 2022 in the company’s annual report published in April.

The 2022 bonus pool for the Swiss bank’s close to 50,000 employees had already gone down to 635 million Swiss francs from 2.76 billion, because of the drop in the bank’s share price.

The Federal Council added that Credit Suisse must also report to authorities on whether it is possible to recover paid-out bonuses, and also decided to cancel or reduce bonuses for the top three levels of management, accrued until the merger with UBS is complete.

At Credit Suisse’s final annual general meeting held on Tuesday, shareholders took to the stage to voice their opposition to the pay Credit Suisse executives and board of directors received in the lead up to its demise.

The bank’s shareholders approved pay for the board of directors for the time until the merger is complete, but voted against approving compensation for the bank’s executives.",[],2023-04-05 00:00:00

(Ennio Leanza/Keystone via AP)

LONDON (AP) — Credit Suisse shares plunged Monday after Swiss authorities cut a deal with its bigger rival UBS to acquire the troubled bank at a marked-down price. But European bank stocks and the wider market gained as investors watch whether moves to shore up banks will stem further upheaval in the global financial system .

Shares of Credit Suisse , whose woes stem from questions over its internal controls, closed nearly 56% lower a day after UBS said it would buy its fellow Swiss bank for a lowball price of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion). The shares traded at about the level they are valued at in the deal.

Swiss regulators orchestrated the purchase in a bid to stop more turmoil after the collapse of two U.S. banks . In an indication of the frantic, behind-the-scenes deal-making to resolve the issue before markets opened, the acquisition was announced late Sunday.

There is still uncertainty over how the deal will play out for the combined lender and what comes next for the wider banking system. Analysts say some previous forced bank mergers didn’t work out well for shareholders in the long run.

It could be that no more banks get into trouble, but it’s also possible that “we just go from one weak institution falling over to the next,” said Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser at Capital Economics.

There no other obvious candidates that could be singled out like Credit Suisse, but it’s “hard to predict where the problems will emerge,” she said.

UBS shares initially dropped on the Swiss stock exchange but closed up 1.3%. The deal whipsawed other European bank stocks , which tumbled before some clawed back their losses. Germany’s Deutsche Bank, France’s BNP Paribas and Italy’s UniCredit ended higher, while London-based Barclays sank 2.3%.

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after a central bank plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) last week failed to reassure investors and customers.

Many of Credit Suisse’s problems were unique and unlike the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S., including high interest rates. Those U.S. failures have raised questions about other potentially weak global financial institutions, sweeping up the already beleaguered Swiss bank.

Credit Suisse has faced an array of troubles in recent years, including bad bets on hedge funds , repeated shakeups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

Analysts and financial leaders say safeguards are stronger since the 2008 global financial crisis and that banks worldwide have plenty of available cash and support from central banks. But concerns about risks to the deal, losses for some investors and Credit Suisse’s falling market value could renew fears about the health of banks .

ADVERTISEMENT

Tobias Straumann, an economic history professor at University of Zurich, said the merger was the right move because the U.S. bank collapses and the danger to Credit Suisse was “an international banking crisis in the making.”

“Markets are very nervous, and I think an additional accident in Switzerland would have fueled a lot of problems,” he said.

Credit Suisse is among 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities were worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

UBS is bigger but Credit Suisse wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. It has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich through its wealth management business, and is a major mergers and acquisitions adviser. However, Credit Suisse weathered the 2008 financial crisis without assistance, unlike UBS.

ADVERTISEMENT

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in higher-risk Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out, leaving investors with hefty losses. Lawyers were already circling, eyeing possible legal action to get compensation for bondholders amid concern about the market for those bonds and other banks that hold them.

The combination of the two Swiss banks, each with histories dating to the mid-19th century, strikes at the country’s reputation as a global financial center — putting it on the cusp of having a single big national bank that would be too big to fail.

Some customers were caught off guard by the turmoil, at odds with Switzerland’s reputation as as stable banking haven.

Sahil Dua, an Indian software engineer living in Zurich, holds a UBS account but opened one at Credit Suisse last Tuesday, the same day the lender flagged “material weaknesses” in internal financial controls that ultimately helped spark its downward spiral.

“My impression as a customer,” Dua said, is “that at least these two banks were going to be fine, whatever happens.”

Dua said he wanted the credit card that came with the Credit Suisse account and that he considered switching over his primary bank account and bringing his savings from UBS. Not anymore.

ADVERTISEMENT

He has a Credit Suisse account “with a balance of zero, and I’m glad that it’s still zero because I didn’t add any money yet to it.” In the future, he plans to spread out his money in more than one bank.

“I will look into diversification more seriously now,” Dua said.

As the market tries to figure out what comes next after the merger, Straumann, the professor, said he wouldn’t be surprised to see problems for regional banks in Europe after further interest rate increases , much like what happened with midsized banks in U.S.

“The banking system of Europe has not fully recovered from the crisis” in 2008, he said. “It’s better, of course, than it used to be, but it’s vulnerable.”

https://www.economicsobservatory.com/why-did-credit-suisse-fail-and-what-does-it-mean-for-banking-regulation,Why did Credit Suisse fail and what does it mean for banking regulation?,"Jitters in the US banking system spilled over into Europe with the buy-out of one of Switzerland’s leading banks by its traditional rival, UBS. The causes of Credit Suisse’s failure are different from those of Silicon Valley Bank, but the impact on future regulation is likely to be greater.

The failure of Credit Suisse was a serious test of the reforms of banking regulation made after the global financial crisis of 2007-09. It was the first failure of a large, interconnected bank that was considered ‘too big to fail’.

The bank’s collapse was also a test of the Swiss authorities’ ability to manage such an event. Credit Suisse’s merger with UBS raises several questions about the robustness of the regulatory reforms and the structure of the Swiss banking sector going forward.

At its peak valuation in 2007, Credit Suisse was worth 100 billion Swiss francs (SFr). On 19 March, UBS agreed to buy it for just SFr3 billion. This is a remarkable fall from grace for an institution that dates back to the 1850s, and is seen as one of the foundations on which Switzerland’s economy was built.

Bank failures often arise from some miscalculation of risk. For example, there might be a huge exposure to an overvalued property market or, as in the case of Silicon Valley Bank, a massive exposure to US government bonds that lost value as interest rates rose rapidly.

Credit Suisse had no such exposure. Instead, this was a bank that has been weakened by a series of scandals over the last two decades.

What were the scandals?

Many banks attract regulatory censure from time to time. But in recent years, Credit Suisse and its employees have been investigated, fined, made settlements and even been imprisoned for various money laundering, corruption, tax evasion and even corporate espionage scandals.

Credit Suisse’s scandals are truly global in nature. They have ranged from money laundering for Japanese gangs and Bulgarian drugs traffickers, to kickbacks in Mozambique, tax evasion in the United States, spying on former employees in Switzerland, dealing with African dictators and jobs-for-business deals with Chinese officials in Hong Kong.

In early 2021, Credit Suisse found itself exposed to the collapses of US hedge fund Archegos Capital and UK finance firm Greensill Capital. Facing massive legal and reimbursement costs, Credit Suisse brought in former Lloyds Banking Group CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio to sort out its culture. But he resigned in January 2022 after twice breaching Covid-19 rules.

As the scandals piled up, investor confidence that Credit Suisse could reform itself evaporated. Indeed, Marlene Amstad, the chair of FINMA (the Swiss financial regulator), noted that Credit Suisse ‘had a cultural problem that translated into a lack of accountability’. As a result, Credit Suisse’s share price has been sliding since the global financial crisis (see Figure 1).

What pushed Credit Suisse over the brink?

The scandals made Credit Suisse look increasingly risky. In October 2022, a journalist tweeted that a major investment bank was ‘on the brink’, leading investors to assume that the bank in question was Credit Suisse. Deposit withdrawals of over SFr100 billion and a decline in share price followed.

Then on 14 March, Credit Suisse announced that it had found ‘material weaknesses’ in its financial reporting for 2021 and 2022. Another scandal looked to be on the cards.

When the chair of Saudi National Bank, Credit Suisse’s largest shareholder, subsequently ruled out further investment, deposits flowed out and the share price collapsed.

What happened next?

On 15 March, the Swiss National Bank provided Credit Suisse with SFr50 billion as a ‘liquidity backstop’ that Credit Suisse could draw down (against collateral) if needed.

The hope was to reassure investors that their money was safe. But this did not succeed. As speculation grew, it became clear that an announcement would be made about Credit Suisse’s future by the end of the weekend (19 March).

In the case of a failing bank, four broad options are available.

The first is to declare insolvency and allow the bank to be wound up through regular company law. This is not an option for large, interconnected banks, as it takes too long and generates too much uncertainty.

To deal quickly with a failing bank, the second option is resolution. Broadly speaking, the regulator steps in, bails-in various creditors and restructures the bank overnight or over a weekend. This is a complicated process because the regulator also needs to ensure continuity in retail banking and other key services to avoid panic in the wider financial system.

As part of reforms after the global financial crisis, regulators and large banks such as Credit Suisse are supposed to have plans in place before a crisis is reached so that they can be resolved smoothly. But the plans for resolving Credit Suisse were still incomplete despite years of preparation.

Further, FINMA chief executive Urban Angehrn stated that implementing them would have had a ‘disastrous impact’ on Switzerland’s financial industry, adding that ‘many other Swiss banks would probably have faced a run on deposits’.

This is an unnerving failure of the post-global financial crisis reforms, and one that should make regulators look again at the current framework.

A third option is to nationalise the bank. In this case the state takes over the bank, including its financial obligations.

Ironically, it seems that this option was ruled out in part because UBS was rescued with public money during the global financial crisis. Although this was ultimately profitable for the Swiss authorities, public outrage at the time seems to have reduced the political appetite for this option with Credit Suisse.

The fourth option – a merger with UBS – was therefore selected.

FINMA chair Amstad has said that several options were considered, noting, for example, that resolution documents were ready to be signed on Sunday 19 March. But this does not mean that they were under serious consideration.

The Financial Times reported that at the same meeting that Credit Suisse was informed about the SFr50 billion liquidity backstop, it was also told that it would have to merge with UBS. This suggests that the Swiss authorities had committed to the buy-out as early as 15 March.

With a hard deadline on the evening of Sunday 19 March, UBS could negotiate a favourable deal. Credit Suisse shareholders were given SFr3 billion in UBS stock. This looks cheap – based on its final share price, Credit Suisse was valued at about SFr7.4 billion. A year ago, its value stood at around SFr20 billion.

UBS also extracted financial guarantees from the government. As part of the deal, UBS has access to a further SFr100 billion from the Swiss National Bank. The Swiss government has also guaranteed losses of up to SFr9 billion (after UBS absorbs the first SFr5 billion). So even though the Swiss finance minister has asserted that this was a ‘commercial solution’, taxpayers’ money is still at risk.

A last key point of the deal was that the Swiss authorities wiped out 17 billion of Credit Suisse’s so-called ‘alternative tier 1’ (AT1) bonds, strengthening the capital position of UBS. This bail-in has proved controversial and we will return to it below.

Conclusions from the events can be drawn both for Switzerland as a financial centre and for financial regulation generally.

What does this mean for Switzerland?

Following the buy-out, UBS accounts for about 200% of Swiss GDP. To put this in context, it is comparable to the amount of bank liabilities guaranteed by the Irish government at the start of the global financial crisis (also around 200% of GDP). That ultimately forced the Irish state into a bail-out.

What could Switzerland do if UBS fails in the future?

Given its size, the Swiss state could find it difficult to cover all of UBS’s potential losses if it were to fail. Further, there would be no bank in Switzerland big enough to buy it out. This leaves resolution. But since the Swiss authorities believe that resolving Credit Suisse could have brought down the Swiss economy, presumably resolving UBS would have the same implications. After all, FINMA believes that the UBS resolution plans are as about as incomplete as those of Credit Suisse.

Both UBS and Credit Suisse are considered ‘global systemically important’ banks. This means that they are required to hold additional capital against losses. The Swiss authorities say that they will increase the amount of capital that UBS is required to hold to reflect its greater size. But this offers little comfort when we consider that Credit Suisse’s capital buffers were insufficient to prevent its failure.

Overall, the main concern is that by facilitating this merger, the Swiss authorities have created an institution that is not just ‘too big to fail’, but ‘too big to save’.

What does the collapse of Credit Suisse mean for financial regulation?

First, the reforms, put in place following the global financial crisis, to supervise large, interconnected banks have not operated as planned. These reforms are intended to ensure that Credit Suisse could be resolved. But the Swiss authorities believed that the plans to do so were incomplete and would have made the situation worse. Perhaps this is an idiosyncratic Swiss issue, but perhaps it is not – in which case, we should worry.

The Swiss authorities have noted that the reforms requiring larger capital buffers enabled Credit Suisse to withstand the run in October 2022. But the extra time it gained did not enable the authorities to prepare a less chaotic end for Credit Suisse. The benefits of larger buffers in this case are thus disputable.

Second, funding costs for banks may increase due to the bail-in of the Credit Suisse AT1 bonds. They were designed to provide additional loss-absorbing capacity by being written down to zero in stress events. But it appears that investors had not expected a write-down to occur before shareholders were completely wiped out.

Immediately after the announcement, investors dramatically increased the yield they required to hold AT1 bonds, prompting regulators in the euro area and the UK to state that they would not bail in bondholders before shareholders.

More recently, many AT1 yields have declined. Whether there will be a longer-term effect on bank funding costs in Switzerland, or more broadly, remains to be seen.

All in all, the collapse of Credit Suisse was not a pretty sight and will have far-reaching effects for both Switzerland and global financial regulation.

By Hannah Lang, Chris Prentice and Ann Saphir

April 14 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's Board of Governors on Friday said it has approved UBS Group AG's acquisition of the U.S. subsidiaries of Credit Suisse, clearing another major hurdle for the completion of the Swiss-brokered rescue deal.

UBS has committed to give the U.S. central bank an implementation plan for combining its U.S. business and operations with those of Credit Suisse within three months of consummating the deal, the Fed's Board said in a statement. The plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution, the statement said.

The U.S. central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

After years of scandal and losses, 167-year-old Credit Suisse came to the brink of collapse before Zurich-based rival UBS rode to the rescue with a merger engineered and bankrolled by the Swiss authorities last month. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

The Swiss authorities and UBS Group AG have been racing to close the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG within as little as a month, in an effort to retain the lender's clients and employees, Reuters previously reported.

UBS secured a temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, people familiar with the process told Reuters.

Story continues

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

The Fed subjects firms with more than $700 billion in assets, or more than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activities, to heightened supervision, including annual company-run stress tests and increased liquidity standards.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann on Tuesday told shareholders he was ""truly sorry"" for the collapse that led to the bank's controversial takeover by UBS . ""It is a sad day for you and for us too. I can understand the bitterness, the anger and the shock of all those who are disappointed, overwhelmed and affected by the developments,"" Lehmann said at the bank's annual meeting, the first time its leaders have addressed the public since the rescue. ""I apologize that we were no longer able to stem the loss of trust that had accumulated over the years, and for disappointing you."" A police presence was established early Tuesday at the venue, as protesters and shareholders began arriving in droves, hoping for answers and accountability following the demise of the 167-year-old Swiss institution. A number of shareholders took to the stage over the course of the morning to lambast the bank's leadership and demand further explanation of the process and reasoning behind the deal. Swiss authorities brokered an emergency rescue of the stricken bank by its larger domestic rival for just 3 billion Swiss francs, over the course of a weekend in late March. It followed a collapse in Credit Suisse's deposits and share price amid fears of a global banking crisis, but the deal remains mired in legal and logistical challenges. Neither UBS nor Credit Suisse shareholders were allowed a vote on the deal.

""Until the end, we fought hard to find a solution, but ultimately there were only two options: deal or bankruptcy,"" Lehmann, who became chairman in January 2022, told shareholders. ""The merger had to go through."" At 2 p.m. London time, Lehmann was re-elected as chairman until the completion of the merger, winning 55.67% of shareholder votes. The remaining board members were narrowly re-elected, with the exception of five that did not stand again. In a statement Sunday, the office of the attorney general confirmed that Switzerland's Federal Prosecutor is investigating potential breaches of Swiss federal law by government officials, regulators and top executives at Credit Suisse and UBS. Both banks declined to comment on Monday. 'We ran out of time' Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Koerner took over in 2021, when the bank was reeling from a series of high-profile scandals, risk management failures and heavy losses. In October 2022, Credit Suisse launched a massive strategic overhaul, aimed at fixing its risk and compliance culture and addressing perennial underperformance in the investment bank. Koerner told shareholders on Tuesday that he returned to Credit Suisse in 2021 hoping to ""tackle the problems that existed and build a new Credit Suisse."" ""In short, I wanted to create an organization that our shareholders, our clients and all our employees could be proud of. Unfortunately, we didn't succeed in the end. We ran out of time. This fills me with sorrow,"" he said. ""What has happened over the past few weeks will continue to affect me personally and many others for a long time to come.""

Commentators have highlighted the importance of the deal's success for Swiss authorities against a febrile political backdrop. The lack of input from shareholders, bondholders and Swiss taxpayers in UBS' acquisition of its embattled rival has sparked widespread anger. Speaking outside the annual meeting, Vincent Kaufmann, CEO of Ethos Foundation which represents pension funds comprising between 3% and 5% of Credit Suisse shareholders, told CNBC that they had ""lost a lot of money"" and ""need to know what management is doing."" Potential courses of action include ""trying to retrieve some of the viable pay that was granted for former management, who may have failed in their duties to protect shareholders' interests,"" he said. ""We're still looking for possibilities — it's quite difficult with the Swiss company law to prove the damage. Mismanagement of a company is not per se something we can concretely act against former members of the management or current members of the management, but still we need to be sure that they gave the whole truth to investors and to the market, so there is still open question,"" Kaufmann told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche. Holders of Credit Suisse's AT1 bond instruments, which were subject to a $17 billion wipeout as part of the UBS takeover, last week instructed a global law firm to pursue discussion and possible litigation with Swiss authorities.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Credit Suisse and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) engaged in a months-long debate over the severity of reporting deficiencies that led the Swiss bank to delay its annual report last month.

Credit Suisse said in March it had postponed the annual filing after a ""late call"" with the regulator which raised questions about earlier financial statements.

Correspondence published in the SEC's online database on Tuesday show that agency staff first raised questions with Credit Suisse officials in July 2022.

Credit Suisse and the SEC declined to comment.

At issue were changes Credit Suisse made to how it booked a series of cash flows, including share-based compensation and foreign exchange hedges, and if control deficiencies needed to be disclosed to its audit committee or escalated to investors.

""Management believes it is prudent to briefly delay the publication of its accounts in order to understand more thoroughly the comments received,"" Credit Suisse said at the time of the delay on March 9.

The last-minute delay concerned analysts and sent Credit Suisse shares to near an all-time low. The back-and-forth between the bank and the U.S. regulator extended into another week as turmoil gripped the banking sector.

As recently as March 10, the SEC asked the bank to explain how it decided that an ""entity-level material weakness did not exist"" for its 2021 and 2022 financial years.

Material weaknesses are considered the most serious of such control failures. In previous letters to the SEC in August and November, Credit Suisse's former chief financial officer David Mathers and his successor Dixit Joshi described the failings as ""deficiencies"", which are considered to be less serious.

In the March 10 letter to Joshi, SEC staff acknowledged discussions with the bank on March 8-10. Joshi responded on March 12, saying in a letter that the firm noted the concerns and had reassessed its position.

Story continues

""We will report that we have, and have had, a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting..."" he said in the letter posted on the SEC online database.

Credit Suisse notified shareholders of the weaknesses in its annual report on March 14, the day before it was granted a liquidity lifeline by the Swiss National Bank.

This proved insufficient and on March 19, the bank's takeover by Swiss rival UBS was announced.

The SEC's chief accountant in March 2022 warned public companies away from a bias toward deeming accounting errors immaterial for investors.

Material weaknesses are unusual among large, sophisticated companies, said Miguel Angel Minutti-Meza, accounting department chair at the University of Miami.

""Once you get to the top bracket, it is very rare to see these issues,"" he said. ""Investors will wonder: how could you not fix these?""

The chairman of Credit Suisse’s largest shareholder, Saudi National Bank, has resigned less than two weeks after comments he made about the Swiss lender accelerated a plunge in its share price.

The bank was rescued four days later after a crisis of confidence among investors and customers took it to the brink of insolvency.

Ammar Al Khudairy had resigned “due to personal reasons” and would be replaced by CEO Saeed Mohammad Al Ghamdi, Saudi National Bank said in a statement Monday.

During an interview with Bloomberg TV on March 15, Al Khudairy ruled out increasing the bank’s stake in Credit Suisse. Such a move would’ve helped shore up confidence in the beleaguered bank, which was facing renewed pressure on its share price amid turmoil in the sector sparked by the collapse of America’s Silicon Valley Bank.

“The answer is absolutely not, for many reasons outside the simplest reason, which is regulatory and statutory,” Al Khudairy said. That was in response to a question on whether Saudi National Bank was open to further equity injections into Credit Suisse if there was a call for additional funds.

Following the comments, the Swiss lender’s stock plunged to the lowest level on record and the cost of insuring its debt surged, all but wiping out the value of Saudi National Bank’s investment.

Less than 24 hours later Credit Suisse borrowed $54 billion from Switzerland’s central bank. But the emergency lifeline was insufficient to stop clients withdrawing deposits at a rate of more than $10 billion a day, ultimately leading to the bank’s historic rescue by larger rival UBS through a government-brokered deal.

Saudi National Bank, which is 37%-owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, acquired a 9.9% stake in Credit Suisse in October for $1.5 billion, making it an anchor investor in the bank’s turnaround plan. By March 17, not even five months later, the Swiss lender had lost around 60% of its market value, erasing the lion’s share of Saudi National Bank’s investment.

Had the bank increased its shareholding in Credit Suisse beyond the 9.9% level, it would have been subjected to additional regulatory obligations.

“If we go above 10%, all new rules kick in whether it be by our regulator or the Swiss regulator or the European regulator,” Al Khudairy said in the Bloomberg TV interview.

“We’re not inclined to get into a new regulatory regime. I can cite five or six other reasons, but one reason is there is a glass ceiling and we’re not going to entertain going beyond it,” he added.",['Hanna Ziady'],2023-03-27 00:00:00

Globally connected Credit Suisse has been taken over by rival UBS at the urging of Swiss authorities to avoid a collapse that could have sent shock waves through the global economy. Analsyts see it as a positive step forward to calm the banking system. (March 20)

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — In a bid to ease turmoil in the world financial system, Swiss authorities engineered a plan for the UBS bank to acquire its troubled smaller rival Credit Suisse at a marked-down price.

It’s another urgent attempt to fight fears that have put the financial world on edge 15 years after the failure of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers pitched the global economy into a crisis.

Here are key things to know — and some things that aren’t yet known — about the takeover and the wider market anxiety fueled by bank failures in the U.S.

WHY IS UBS TAKING OVER CREDIT SUISSE?

Swiss authorities pushed UBS to take over its rival after the price of Credit Suisse shares plunged and depositors fled, raising fears that it could fail.

Credit Suisse isn’t just any bank. Unlike midsize Silicon Valley Bank, which went under earlier this month in the U.S., it is one of 30 banks classified as globally significant because it could pose a risk of bigger trouble if it collapses, as happened with Lehman.

ADVERTISEMENT

Credit Suisse’s troubles pre-dated Silicon Valley’s failure, including a $5.5 billion loss on its dealings with private investment firm Archegos and a spying scandal.

Then fears about banks fed by the U.S. failures made investors take a closer, less friendly look at banks. When Credit Suisse’s biggest investor, Saudi National Bank, refused to put up more money, investors and depositors headed for the exits.

WILL THE TAKEOVER RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM?

Confidence in banks is shaky right now . That said, economists, bank regulators and stock-market analysts generally say that banks are in better shape than in 2008, with thicker financial buffers against losses and a slew of new regulations.

And this time, policymakers have been quicker to respond. The U.S. Federal Reserve offered credit to banks that suffered uninsured losses on bond holdings due to rising interest rates.

On Sunday, just ahead of the opening of markets in Asia, other central banks joined the Fed in expanding unlimited dollar credit to any bank that needs it. That was a swift preemptive move used in earlier emergencies such as the pandemic market meltdown of 2020.

Swiss officials balked at letting Credit Suisse just fail, unlike the U.S. government in 2008, when it let Lehman go under, spreading losses and fear across the financial system. Financial institutions had been in trouble since 2007, but it wasn’t until two weeks after Lehman that the U.S. Congress came to the system’s aid with a $700 billion emergency economic stabilization act.

Questions have been raised about the technicalities of the Credit Suisse rescue and the decision to insure all depositors at Silicon Valley. But officials are showing that they learned one lesson from Lehman, “namely to act decisively and swiftly, and if needed to run roughshod over any discussion of moral hazard and legal obstacles, both of which can be discussed once the dust settles,” said Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at ADM Investor Services International.

ADVERTISEMENT

As a result, “some semblance of calm has been restored. This crisis is far from over, but at least some of the immediate risks of an exponential ballooning of contagion effects have been mitigated.”

SO WE CAN SOUND THE ALL CLEAR?

Not yet. UBS shares initially plunged Monday on fears that the bank has simply inherited trouble by buying Credit Suisse. The share later turned positive. And the way the takeover was done, by wiping out some of the Credit Suisse’s bondholders, rattled markets in those bonds. So new problems could arise.

“Containing crises is a bit like a game of whack-a-mole — with new fires starting as existing ones are extinguished,” said Neal Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics. “A key issue over the next week will be whether problems arise in other institutions or parts of the financial system.”

Among the lingering worries: Did other U.S. banks ignore the risk that interest rates might swiftly rise, as Silicon Valley did? Could there be trouble in other parts of the financial sector that don’t take insured deposits, such as investment banks, hedge funds and mortgage brokers?

ADVERTISEMENT

Said Shearing: “A reasonable base case is that we avoid a system-wide crisis on the scale of 2007-08, but further problems emerge at individual institutions.”

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR SWISS BANKS?

In the global financial crisis, it was UBS that needed government help, while Credit Suisse did not. Now UBS faces the task of integrating Credit Suisse and sorting out its problems.

Switzerland, which had five big banks 30 years ago, is now left with one very large bank that’s “too big to fail.”

“That means the government is even more challenged to support any problems in the financial system,” said Tobias Straumann, an economic history professor at the University of Zurich.

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY?

Analysts say pressure from markets and regulators may now make banks less likely to risk new lending, which could restrict credit for new purchases or investment in new businesses.

ADVERTISEMENT

If credit is seen to tighten because of fears over banks, central banks such as the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England might choose to slow down their recent rapid interest rate increases aimed at fighting inflation — or to stop the increases at a lower level than they otherwise would have.

Tighter credit, whether from nervous banks or from central bankers raising rates, tends to counteract inflation.

That was behind European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde’s statement last week after the bank raised rates by a half-percentage point. She said further rate decisions would be taken meeting to meeting based on the latest data.

Lagarde said Monday that the current financial tensions “might have an impact on demand and might actually do some of the work that might otherwise be done by monetary policy.”

With the impeccable timing of one of the country's famed watches, Swiss officials brokered a last-minute emergency takeover of the troubled bank Credit Suisse by fellow banking giant UBS.

In a press conference on Sunday, Swiss president Alain Berset said the recent banking industry turmoil had destabilized Credit Suisse and that this deal was vital to stabilizing the bank and the global banking sector.

Under the deal, UBS Group AG will buy Credit Suisse for more than $3 billion in an all stock deal. UBS will also get an extra $100 billion from the Swiss central bank as part of the deal.

Swiss Assist

The marriage between UBS and struggling rival Credit Suisse marks the latest eruption in the ongoing banking troubles sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

Panicked investors and jittery depositors pulled billions out of the long-troubled Credit Suisse in recent days, leading to worries the bank could become insolvent if emergency measures were not taken. The Swiss central bank threw a $54 billion life to Credit Suisse, but it wasn't enough to stabilize the institution.

It's yet another stunning event in more than a week of turmoil and alarm in the banking sector, especially worrisome because Credit Suisse is what's known as a ""global systemically important bank."" That essentially means if Credit Suisse fails, it could have ripple effects throughout the global economy.

A History of Trouble

The Credit Suisse crisis boiled over last week, when the bank announced ""material weaknesses"" in its financial reporting.

But the bank's troubles started long before that, with a series of financial and political scandals that hit the bank's reputation and bottom line. In the last two years alone, the bank's stock has fallen by more than 80%.

Credit Suisse was created 166 years ago to help finance Switzerland's rail network. It became an international name in the banking sector and one of the most significant banks in the world

But the bank's reputation has taken several huge hits in recent years, including being linked to a money laundering operation involving a cocaine trafficking ring in Bulgaria, and hiring detectives to spy on an executive who left to work at a rival bank.",['Stacey Vanek Smith'],2023-03-19 00:00:00

Lawmakers in Switzerland's Parliament have symbolically rejected a deal brokered by the government last month, in which investment bank UBS took over troubled rival Credit Suisse, thanks largely to guarantees from the country's central bank.

The deal, reached on March 19,saw UBS assume control of the 167-year-old institution for $122 billion, thanks to a weekend of frantic activity after the bank got into trouble.

Fearing Credit Suisse's full meltdown and wider financial chaos, the Swiss government ensured the deal was in place.

The deal, which involved a$111-billion liquidity lifeline from the Swiss National Bank and an$11-billion guarantee from the Swiss government against any losses UBS may incur because of the takeover, was debated by lawmakers on Wednesday.

Alain Berset, president of Switzerland's federal council, urged them to support it, saying: ""Time was running out and the situation was deteriorating from hour to hour.""

He said the bank would surely have failed on either March 20 or March 21 if the government had not acted, causing ""an international financial crisis with devastating effects for our country"".

But lawmakers in the lower house of Switzerland's Parliament overwhelmingly rejected the intervention, by 103 votes to 71, with 8 abstaining.

Their opposition changed nothing, however, because the Swiss government intervened under an emergency law and did not need parliamentary approval.

After the symbolic vote, Switzerland's finance ministry said: ""This decision has no impact on the takeover of Credit Suisse decided on March 19.""

German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle, or DW, said the Swiss government added that ""the finance delegation of the Swiss Parliament"" gave its ""binding approval"" to the deal ""on behalf of Parliament, due to the urgency of the matter"".

DW said the government's action without first seeking approval from lawmakers seems, however, to have angered many ordinary people because Swiss voters are used to being consulted on important issues through frequent referendums.

And, despite the vote's lack of teeth, Eva Herzog, a lawmaker in the Swiss Parliament's upper house, told The Associated Press news agency that a rejection of the government's actions would ""really send a bad signal"".",[],2023-04-14 00:00:00

GENEVA (AP) — Credit Suisse shares surged Thursday after the Swiss central bank agreed to loan the bank up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) to bolster confidence in the country’s second-biggest lender following the collapse of two U.S. banks .

Credit Suisse announced the agreement before the Swiss stock market opened, sending shares up as much as 33% before they settled around a 17% gain, to 2 francs ($2.15), in late afternoon trading. That was a massive turnaround from a day earlier, when news that the bank’s biggest shareholder would not inject more money into Credit Suisse sent its shares tumbling 30%. The plunge in price dragged down other European banks and deepened concerns about the international financial system.

European banking stocks also rose modestly Thursday.

The Swiss National Bank said Wednesday that it was prepared to back Credit Suisse because it meets the higher financial requirements imposed on “systemically important banks,” adding that the problems at some U.S. banks don’t “pose a direct risk of contagion” to Switzerland.

Regulators are trying to reassure depositors that their money is safe. They “don’t want anybody to be the person who sits in a darkened room or darkened cinema and shouts fire, because that’s what prompts a rush for the exits,” said Russ Mould, investment director at the online investment platform AJ Bell.

Credit Suisse, which was beset by problems long before the U.S. bank failures, said the loans from the central bank would give it time to complete a reorganization designed to create a “simpler and more focused bank.”

“These measures demonstrate decisive action to strengthen Credit Suisse as we continue our strategic transformation,” Chief Executive Ulrich Koerner said in a statement.

Despite the banking turmoil, the European Central Bank approved a large, half-percentage point increase in interest rates to try to curb stubbornly high inflation, saying Europe’s banking sector is “resilient,” with strong finances.

European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos said at a news conference that European banks’ exposure to Credit Suisse is “quite limited.”

Higher rates fight inflation but in recent days have fueled concern that banks may have caused hidden losses on their balance sheets.

Central banks in the U.S. and Europe have moved quickly to restore confidence after last week’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the second-biggest bank failure in U.S. history.

American authorities moved quickly to guarantee all of the deposits of the California-based bank and the smaller Signature Bank of New York. The U.S. Federal Reserve also announced additional funding to ensure other banks could meet the needs of depositors.

In a similar move, the British government and Bank of England facilitated the sale of Silicon Valley Bank’s U.K. arm to HSBC, one of Europe’s biggest banks, ensuring that customers would have access to their money.

The rapid response is different from what happened at the start of the global financial crisis 15 years ago, when U.S. authorities allowed the investment banking giant Lehman Brothers to collapse.

The loans to Credit Suisse “should prevent a Lehman moment, much to the relief of markets and investors,” said Victoria Scholar, the head of investment at the online investment service known as Interactive Investor. “This is a bank that’s been around since 1865 and has been instrumental in supporting growth of the Swiss economy.”

ECB President Christine Lagarde said the banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis.

After that crisis, Europe strengthened its banking safeguards by transferring supervision of the biggest banks to the central bank.

“Crises are never exactly the same,” she said, “but the architecture of our banking system, the framework within which they operate, the supervision that is applied to the banking system, have been all considerably improved.”

Banks are under pressure after interest rates rose rapidly following a prolonged period of historically low rates.

To boost the return on their investments, banks needed to take more risks and some “did this more prudently than others,” said Sascha Steffen, professor of finance at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management.

As a result, some banks now face a shortage of “liquidity,” meaning they cannot sell assets quickly enough to meet the demands of depositors.

Credit Suisse shares dropped to a record low Wednesday after the Saudi National Bank said it would not put more money into the Swiss lender to avoid regulations that kick in if an investor’s stake rises above 10%.

Credit Suisse also reported that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned new doubts about the bank’s ability to weather the storm.

Its stock has suffered a long, sustained decline: Now trading for a little over 2 francs ($2.15), the stock was valued at more than 80 francs ($86.71) in 2007.

The Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds , repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving Zurich rival UBS.

Outside a Credit Suisse branch on Thursday, accountant David Glaus said the Swiss government is unlikely to let such a large bank fail, if for no other reason than to protect Switzerland’s banking industry.

“It remains a Swiss bank. In the background, there are people who will support and protect it because I don’t think it’s in our best interests for it to go bankrupt,” he said.

But he thinks the country has a fallback position to keep up appearances in case of the worst.

“We still have chocolate and cheese, anyway, to uphold our image,” he said.

A wave of defaults doesn’t mean a tsunami, it says","In a matter of nine days, bank runs and global financial distress saw regional U.S. banks like Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank go under, while European regulators helped to broker a deal for UBS to buy rival giant Credit Suisse, which had just collapsed.

While central bankers and policymakers alike try to assess what type of economic fallout could come from the March bank runs, the commercial real estate industry is already bracing for pain. Even before these bank failures, commercial office space defaults were rising as owners got squeezed by high vacancy rates, falling property values, and higher interest rates. That’ll only intensify if these bank woes see lenders further tighten lending standards for commercial real estate (CRE) loans.

Earlier this week, analysts at Morgan Stanley took a bearish tone, writing their forecast of “a peak-to-trough CRE price decline of as much as 40%” would be worse than the dip seen during the Great Financial Crisis. However, a report published on Thursday by analysts at UBS, a Zurich-based multinational investment bank, struck a less pessimistic tone, writing that commercial real estate “headlines are worse than reality,” and troubles aren’t likely to create a “repeat of the 2008 liquidity crisis.”

“Rising interest rates, a slowing economy, and increasing vacancy rates in office buildings have weighed on the sector in the last couple of years. Now, an expected credit crunch on the back of rising cost of funding for banks may further compound its troubles. However, in our view, while the risks in CRE have certainly increased, it does not pose a wider systemic risk,” wrote UBS Americas chief investment officer Solita Marcelli and UBS equity strategist Jonathan Woloshin.

Here’s how Marcelli and Woloshin see the CRE landscape.

Commercial real estate defaults are coming

In 2023 and 2024, approximately $1.2 trillion of the outstanding $5.4 trillion in commercial real estate debt (excluding multifamily) will “mature” and need to be refinanced at, presumably, higher interest rates. Those elevated debt payments, wrote Marcelli and Woloshin, will “only add to existing challenges around servicing debt—especially in areas like office and certain segments of retail where cash flows have become challenged due to post-pandemic behavior.”

Simply put: Owners of commercial office space are seeing a hit to their property values and revenues (i.e., rising vacancy rates as remote work proves sticky) just as their debt payments rise (i.e., maturing loans). The recent bank failures will only make this messier.

“A growing share of CRE loans from banks have become serviced by regional and local banks in recent years—with around 70% now coming from this population. Given the recent collapses of both SVB and SBNY—both of which happened to have a large share of CRE as a percentage of their total loan book—the market has grown concerned that regulations around these banks will tighten and lending will become increasingly restrictive, thus reducing lending access,” wrote Marcelli and Woloshin at UBS.

The result? The UBS analysts say CRE “default rates will likely” continue to rise.

‘A liquidity crisis similar to 2008 remains unlikely’

But an uptick in CRE defaults doesn’t mean doomsday for banks, write the UBS analysts.

For starters, the UBS team points out that the most troubled sector of commercial real estate (i.e., office space) only accounts for 15% of the total value of U.S. commercial real estate.

“About $1.3 billion of office mortgage loans are currently slated to mature over the next three years. It’s possible that some of these loans will need to be restructured, but the scope of the issue pales in comparison to the more than $2 trillion of bank equity capital. Office exposure for banks represents less than 5% of total loans and just 1.9% on average for large banks,” wrote Marcelli and Woloshin. The “stress” that does come “could take several years to unfold as leases come due over an extended period of time.”

Unlike, say, ground retail leases, office space leases are often in terms that extend near or beyond 10 years. Those long leases are why office space owners didn‘t buckle as occupancy rates plummeted during the pandemic. That long time horizon is another reason why UBS doesn’t foresee CRE spurring a 2008-style banking crash.

“We don’t believe a repeat of the 2008 liquidity crisis is likely,” wrote Marcelli and Woloshin. “In our view, the health of the overall banking system and market liquidity conditions are substantially better than they were during the GFC.”

If a recession hits, things could get murkier

As the Federal Reserve nears the end of its rate hiking cycle, employment and economic activity at large haven’t been significantly impacted. While most economists are weary of uttering the words “soft landing,” there’s also no consensus on whether the much talked about recession will actually happen.

But if a sharp recession does come, commercial real estate in the United States and Europe would be in for even more trouble.

“A more severe economic downturn (hard landing) over 2023–24 could pull forward [commercial real estate] credit issues that would have otherwise been avoided or stretched over a longer period thereby pressuring banks’ earnings growth and profitability…While we view potential losses as manageable, we would expect a meaningful deterioration in CRE to pressure banks’ shares due to both earnings/profitability risk,” wrote Marcelli and Woloshin.",['Lance Lambert'],2023-04-07 00:00:00
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swiss-lawmakers-pick-apart-credit-084338369.html,Swiss lawmakers pick apart Credit Suisse woes ahead of deal,"GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland’s parliament opened a special session Tuesday to scrutinize the state-imposed takeover of Swiss bank Credit Suisse by rival UBS — and consider strengthening the legal arsenal to better gird against financial blowups.

The debate could run up to three days, with lawmakers voicing — and needing to iron out — disagreements over the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.25 billion) fusion of Switzerland's top two banks, a thunderclap for a country that prides itself on finesse and acumen in finance.

Swiss authorities stepped in as shares of Credit Suisse plunged last month and depositors pulled their money after the failure of two U.S. banks sparked concerns about the stability of global financial system and the long-troubled lender. Credit Suisse is among 30 “globally systemically important banks,” and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

“The situation on the financial markets has calmed down, but it is not fully stabilized, and our country — Switzerland — has emerged shaken by this painful episode,” Swiss President Alain Berset said at the session.

He said lawmakers would need to ensure that the legal framework was “as solid as possible to prevent this kind of crisis from happening again.” The executive branch also would look into “too big to fail” rules for key banks passed after the 2008 global financial crisis that may need changing, Berset added.

Lawmakers also are considering accountability for Credit Suisse and concerns about thousands of expected job cuts and looking at state-backed guarantees of over $100 billion aimed at holding the bank together until the merger is completed and buttressing UBS against possible losses.

They also are debating what it will mean for Switzerland to have one giant bank.

Johanna Gapany, a centrist lawmaker and rapporteur for the upper chamber's finance commission, said the parliamentary panel had made three main proposals: change competition rules in light of the emergence of megabank UBS, examine how Credit Suisse executives might be held accountable and block the executive branch from unilaterally releasing more emergency funds for the rescue plan.

Story continues

The proposals showed a ""clear intention to not only prevent this situation from happening again, but to make sure that the solution protects the interests of citizens as much as possible — thus by taking the least risk with the guarantees that have been provided,” Gapany said.

Despite the talk, few concrete results were expected from the session, which is primarily to flesh out ideas — and possibly some vitriol — from lawmakers who all face reelection this fall.

Yvan Lengwiler, an economics professor at the University of Basel, suggested that the debate would play into a longtime “tug-of-war” between lawmakers who have lobbied in favor of Swiss banks over the years and others who have long sought to stiffen regulation.

“It seems that the pendulum, after this debacle we’ve seen, has clearly shifted towards strengthening,” he said. “Two years from now … the political situation might be very different, and it could be quite difficult to get this through parliament.”

Jakob Stark, an upper-house lawmaker from the populist, right-wing Swiss People's Party, said the rescue of Credit Suisse was “was probably right and ultimately unavoidable” but that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority — known as FINMA — must become ”more decisive.""

“It should, for instance, get the authority to impose fines, but then it should also really impose the fines, and particularly on the big institutions,” Stark said of the regulator. ""My feeling is that it was too considerate toward Credit Suisse, perhaps because of a legal basis that wasn’t sufficiently clear.”

The Swiss attorney general’s office has already opened a probe into events surrounding Credit Suisse ahead of the takeover, and the executive branch last week ordered tens of millions in cuts to the bonuses of top Credit Suisse executives.

Lawmakers largely were expected to line up behind the rescue plan — even if reluctantly for some — and were not yet expected to authorize a parliamentary investigation of the epochal rescue of Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old pillar of Swiss banking.

Lengwiler, who specializes in financial market regulation, noted that the combined bank will have a balance sheet that will be twice as large as Switzerland’s annual economy.

That’s nothing new: Both Credit Suisse and UBS had bigger balance sheets than the Swiss economy before the 2008 financial crisis. But this combined bank will be unprecedented in size and heft, presenting new challenges for government officials.

“What’s new here is that it’s the only kid on the block now,” Lengwiler said. “UBS is really the only game in town and … has become extremely dominant, and that is a problem for Switzerland.”

“It’s maybe too large for the country,” he added.

CREDIT SUISSE'S ALLEGED MISCONDUCT

On March 10, 2022, Credit Suisse filed with the SEC its 2021 annual report on a Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 2021 annual report failed to identify any material weaknesses with Credit Suisse's internal controls.

On December 1, 2022, Credit Suisse's Chairman, Axel P. Lehmann (""Lehmann"") stated in an interview with Financial Times that customer outflows had not only ""completely flattened out,"" but had, in fact, ""partially reversed."" The following day, in an interview with Bloomberg Television, Lehmann reiterated his previous statements, reassuring investors that as of November 11, 2022, customer outflows had ""basically stopped."" Following Lehmann's statements, Credit Suisse's American Depository Share (""ADS"") price rose $0.29 per ADS, or 9.36%, to close at $3.38 per ADS on December 2, 2022.

Then on February 9, 2023, Credit Suisse issued a press release announcing its 2022 financial results. The press release revealed that, contrary to Lehmann's prior statements, large customer outflows had continued through year-end 2022. Specifically, the press release reported customer outflows of 110.5 billion Swiss francs in the final three months of 2022, a figure which far exceeded market expectations. Following this news, Credit Suisse's ADS price fell $0.56 per ADS, or 15.64%, to close at $3.02 per ADS on February 9, 2023.

On February 21, 2023, Reuters reported that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority was reviewing Lehmann's previous comments regarding customer outflows. Following this news, Credit Suisse's ADS price fell another $0.10 per ADS, or 3.31%, to close at $2.92 per ADS on February 21, 2023.

Then on Tuesday, March 14, 2023, Credit Suisse issued its annual 2022 report and revealed that it had identified ""certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting"" for the years 2021 and 2022. Additionally, on Wednesday, March 15, 2023, the chairman of Credit Suisse's largest shareholder, Saudi National Bank, which holds 9.88% of Credit Suisse, announced that it won't provide further financial support to Credit Suisse and that it would not buy more shares on regulatory grounds.

Following this news, the price of Credit Suisse ADSs fell 13.94% to close at $2.16 per ADS on March 15, 2023.

Finally, on March 20, 2023, Credit Suisse issued an announcement on Form 6-K of its merger agreement with Union Bank of Switzerland and that Union Bank of Switzerland would be the surviving entity upon closing of the merger transaction.

Following this news, the price of Credit Suisse ADSs fell 52.99% to close at $0.9450 per ADS on March 20, 2023.

Shares of Credit Suisse jumped Thursday after saying it would borrow up to $54 billion from Switzerland's central bank, an emergency step intended to prop up investor confidence in the troubled European bank.

Credit Suisse shares had plunged on Wednesday, prompting stock markets to fall in the U.S. and around the world, amid rising concerns about the stability of the global banking system after U.S. regulators were forced to rescue Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank on Sunday.

Credit Suisse's troubles, however, were distinct from the two collapsed U.S. lenders. The European bank had already been reeling after a succession of scandals and poor decisions that several CEOs have failed to address over several years.

The lender also recently acknowledged there had been potential problems with the way it reported its financial position as recently as last year, and its shares then plunged on Wednesday after the chairman of its biggest shareholder, Saudi National Bank, said it would not increase its nearly 10% investment.

But Credit Suisse found a reprieve for now after saying late on Wednesday it would borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs, or about $54 billion, from the Swiss National Bank after the central bank had earlier said it was willing to provide support if required.

Shares of the Swiss lender rose more than 20% in European trading.

Caution persists about global banks

Credit Suisse's woes come as the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank have raised concerns about the financial health of the U.S. banking system despite assurances from President Biden and administration officials.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will testify before the Senate Finance Committee later on Thursday and is set to say the U.S. banking system is ""sound"" and to assure depositors their money is safe, according to prepared remarks.

Credit Suisses's plunge on Wednesday had sparked fears that the concerns about the U.S. financial system were spreading to other parts of the world.

Hours after the Swiss central bank said it was ready to provide financial support to Credit Suisse, the beleaguered megabank took it up on the offer, hoping to reassure investors that it had the necessary cash to stay afloat.

Credit Suisse said it would borrow up to 50 billion Swiss Francs ($53.7 billion) from the Swiss National Bank. Investors sent shares in the country’s second biggest lender crashing by as much as 30% Wednesday.

The bank called the loan a “decisive action to pre-emptively strengthen its liquidity.”

“This additional liquidity would support Credit Suisse’s core businesses and clients as Credit Suisse takes the necessary steps to create a simpler and more focused bank built around client needs,” the bank said in a statement.

In addition to the loan from the central bank, Credit Suisse also said it repurchased billions of dollars of its own debt to manage its liabilities and interest payment expenses. The offer covers $2.5 billion of US dollar bonds and €500 million ($529 million) of euro bonds.

The venerable but troubled bank, founded in 1856, is one of the biggest financial institutions in the world and categorized as a “global systemically important bank,” along with just 30 others, including JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and the Bank of China.

Asian stocks fell sharply to start the day Thursday but bounced way off their lows after Credit Suisse’s action, cheered by the bank’s determination to restore confidence in its operations.

Earlier Wednesday, in a joint statement with the Swiss financial market regulator FINMA, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) said Credit Suisse (CS) met the “strict capital and liquidity requirements” imposed on banks of importance to the wider financial system.

“If necessary, the SNB will provide CS with liquidity,” they said.

Already on edge after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in the United States last week, investors dumped shares in the embattled Swiss bank earlier in the day, sending them plummeting to a new record low after its biggest backer appeared to rule out providing any more funding.

In their statement, the Swiss authorities said that the problems of “certain banks in the USA do not pose a direct risk of contagion for the Swiss financial markets.”

“There are no indications of a direct risk of contagion for Swiss institutions due to the current turmoil in the US banking market,” the statement continued.

Saudi backers ‘not inclined’ to increase funding

The chairman of the Saudi National Bank — Credit Suisse’s biggest shareholder, following a capital increase last fall — said earlier Wednesday it would not increase its stake in Credit Suisse.

“The answer is absolutely not, for many reasons,” Ammar Al Khudairy told Bloomberg, on the sidelines of a conference in Saudi Arabia. “I’ll cite the simplest reason, which is regulatory and statutory. We now own 9.8% of the bank — if we go above 10% all kinds of new rules kick in, whether be it by our regulator or the European regulator or the Swiss regulator,” he said. “We’re not inclined to get into a new regulatory regime.”

Once a big player on Wall Street, Credit Suisse has been hit by a series of missteps and compliance failures over the past few years that have damaged its reputation with clients and investors, and cost several top executives their jobs.

Customers withdrew 123 billion Swiss francs ($133 billion) from Credit Suisse last year — mostly in the fourth quarter — and the bank reported an annual net loss of nearly 7.3 billion Swiss francs ($7.9 billion), its biggest since the global financial crisis in 2008.

In October, the lender embarked on a “radical” restructuring plan that entails cutting 9,000 full-time jobs, spinning off its investment bank and focusing on wealth management.

Al Khudairy said he was pleased with the restructuring, adding that he didn’t think the Swiss lender would need extra money. Others are not so sure.

Johann Scholtz, a European banking analyst at Morningstar, said Credit Suisse might no longer have enough capital to absorb losses in 2023 because its funding costs were becoming prohibitive.

“To stem client outflows and ease the concern of providers of wholesale funding, we believe Credit Suisse needs another rights [share] issue,” he commented Wednesday. “We believe the alternative would be a break-up … with the healthy businesses — the Swiss bank, asset management and wealth management and possibly some parts of the investment banking business — being sold off or separately listed.”

‘Not just a Swiss problem’

The bank’s shares were last down 24% in Zurich on Wednesday, and the cost of buying insurance against the risk of a Credit Suisse default hit a new record high, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The crash spilled over into other European banking shares, with French and German banks such as BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank falling between 8% and 12%. Italian and UK banks also slumped.

Two supervisory sources told Reuters that the ECB had contacted banks to quiz them about their exposures to Credit Suisse. The ECB declined to comment.

While the problems at Credit Suisse were widely known, with assets of about 530 billion Swiss francs ($573 billion) it presents a much bigger potential headache.

“[Credit Suisse] is much more globally interconnected, with multiple subsidiaries outside Switzerland including in the US,” wrote Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics. “Credit Suisse is not just a Swiss problem but a global one.”

The blows keep coming for Switzerland’s second biggest bank. On Tuesday, it acknowledged “material weakness” in its financial reporting and scrapped bonuses for top executives.

Credit Suisse said in its annual report that it had found “the group’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective” because it failed to adequately identify potential risks to financial statements.

The bank is urgently developing a “remediation plan” to strengthen its controls.

Speaking to Bloomberg TV on Tuesday, Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Körner said the bank saw “material good inflows” of money on Monday, even as markets were spooked by the collapse of SVB and Signature Bank in the United States.

Overall, outflows from the bank had “significantly moderated” after customers withdrew 111 billion francs ($122 billion) in the three months to December, Körner added. In its annual report, the bank said outflows had not yet reversed by the end of last year.

Banking giant UBS is buying its smaller rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion, in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in global banking.

GENEVA (AP) — Banking giant UBS is buying troubled rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion, in a deal orchestrated by regulators in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in the global banking system.

Swiss authorities pushed for UBS to take over its smaller rival after a plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and the bank’s customers. Shares of Credit Suisse and other banks plunged this week after the failure of two banks in the U.S. sparked concerns about other potentially shaky institutions in the global financial system.

Credit Suisse is among the 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

The deal was “one of great breadth for the stability of international finance,” said Swiss President Alain Berset as he announced it Sunday night. “An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.”

Switzerland’s executive branch, a seven-member governing body that includes Berset, passed an emergency ordinance allowing the merger to go through without shareholder approval.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann called the sale “a clear turning point.”

“It is a historic, sad and very challenging day for Credit Suisse, for Switzerland and for the global financial markets,” Lehmann said, adding that the focus is now on the future and in particular on the 50,000 Credit Suisse employees, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland.

Following news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated financial moves to stabilize banks in the coming week. This includes daily access to a lending facility for banks looking to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice which widely used during the 2008 financial crisis. Three months after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September of 2008, such swap lines had been tapped for $580 billion. Added swap lines were also rolled out during market turmoil in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in March of 2020.

“Today is one of the most significant days in European banking since 2008, with far-reaching repercussions for the industry,” said Max Georgiou, an analyst at Third Bridge. “These events could alter the course of not only European banking but also the wealth management industry more generally.”

Colm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed the “enormous opportunities” that emerge from the takeover, and highlighted his bank’s “conservative risk culture” — a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse’s reputation for more swashbuckling, aggressive gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said the council “regrets that the bank, which was once a model institution in Switzerland and part of our strong location, was able to get into this situation at all.”

The combination of the two biggest and best-known Swiss banks, each with storied histories dating to the mid-19th century, amounts to a thunderclap for Switzerland’s reputation as a global financial center — leaving it on the cusp of having a single national champion in banking.

The deal follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further panic. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse’s share price began plummeting this week.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde lauded the “swift action” by Swiss officials, saying they were “instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.”

She said the banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.

UBS officials said they plan to sell off parts of Credit Suisse or reduce the bank’s size in the coming months and years.

The Swiss government is providing more than 100 billion francs in aid and financial backstops to make the deal go through.

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out. European bank regulators use a special type of bond designed to provide a capital cushion to banks in times of distress. But these bonds are designed to be wiped out if a bank’s capital falls below a certain level, which was triggered as part of this government-brokered deal.

Berset said the Federal Council had already been discussing a long-troubled situation at Credit Suisse since the beginning of the year and held urgent meetings in the last four days amid spiraling concerns about its financial health that caused major swoons in its stock price and raised the specter of the 2007-08 financial crisis.

Investors and banking industry analysts were still digesting the deal, but at least one analyst was sour on the news because it could damage Switzerland’s global banking image.

“A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,” said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas LLC, in an email.

Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

The Credit Suisse parent bank is not part of European Union supervision, but it has entities in several European countries that are. Lagarde reiterated what she said last week after the central bank raised interest rates — that the European banking sector is resilient, with strong financial reserves and plenty of ready cash.

Many of Credit Suisse’s problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve . As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.

The deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn’t invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.

On Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.

Its current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.

While smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.

The Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds , repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

""We are happy to have found a solution, which I'm convinced will bring lasting stability and security for clients, staff, financial markets and to Switzerland.""

""The accelerating loss of confidence and the escalation over the last few days have made it clear that Credit Suisse can no longer exist in its current form,"" Lehmann said.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann told a press conference Sunday that the ""latest developments that emanated from the banks in the U.S. hit us at the most unfavorable moment.""

The announcement of a loan of up to 50 billion Swiss francs from the Swiss National Bank failed to soothe investor concerns and eventually necessitated the 167-year-old institution's ""emergency rescue"" by UBS.

After years of heavy losses and costly scandals , Credit Suisse's most recent share price plunge began with the collapse of U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and was compounded when top investor the Saudi National Bank said it could not provide any more financial assistance.

Despite bold proclamations from Swiss authorities and central banks about a return to stability, the deal does not appear to have laid to rest concerns about systemic risks to global markets.

In equal parts ""shotgun wedding"" and arranged marriage, UBS agreed to buy stricken domestic rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion) on Sunday.

The cut-price deal is expected to close this year and creates a banking behemoth with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets. The deal also includes support from the Swiss government, financial regulator FINMA, and the Swiss National Bank (SNB), which will offer a liquidity line of up to 100 billion Swiss francs, backed by a federal default guarantee. The government will offer a loss guarantee of up to 9 billion Swiss francs, with UBS assuming the first 5 billion of potential losses.

Shares of both UBS and Credit Suisse plunged on Monday morning, however.

Clarity at last?

Goldman Sachs said in a note late Sunday that the deal and associated liquidity and loss guarantees provided ""clarity"" and dampened tail risks. The U.S. bank has shifted back to an overweight allocation on European banks as a result.

""Of course, we are mindful that the situation among U.S. regional banks remains fluid. But as we discussed on Friday, we take comfort from the limited contagion from U.S. regional banks to larger money center banks, a trend we expect will persist,"" the Wall Street giant's credit strategists said.

Goldman also reiterated its favorable view on U.S. ""money center"" banks, a view echoed by Smead Capital Management's CEO Cole Smead, who said interest rate rises from central banks help lenders ""that don't do stupid things in their assets.""

""Poor stock markets have caused investment banks to be the laggards, but commercial banks look good next to them,"" he said via email, naming JPMorgan and Bank of America as stocks he particularly likes.

Smead also said investors could expect higher returns on assets from the new UBS-Credit Suisse entity, along with more consolidation in the European banking sector.

But bigger questions remain over the potential market impact of the deal. James Sym, head of equities at London-based investment manager River and Mercantile, told CNBC that the market was in ""seek and destroy mode.""

""This solves what I think is probably an idiosyncratic problem at Credit Suisse, but I'm not sure it's a firebreak big enough to stop the rot for the market,"" he said Monday. Although he added that the rest of the European banking system is ""much more robust"" than it was.""

Since the Global Financial Crisis, the continent's banks have built much larger capital buffers in order to withstand systemic risks.

Sym suggested that if European bank shares fall significantly as a result of the deal, he might ""start to nibble"" at some stocks, potentially even UBS.

""In the short term, the market is not going to like this deal for UBS, it's not core to the strategy, but I think over the medium term it does potentially give them an edge to compete globally with the Americans and really puts them in an unassailable position domestically.""

Risks remain

While the deal could bring an end to doubts about the viability of Credit Suisse as a business, some analysts still believe the devil will be in the detail as the finer points are hashed out over the coming weeks and months.

""One issue is that the reported price of $3.25bn (CHF0.5 per share) equates to ~4% of book value, and about 10% of Credit Suisse's market value at the start of the year,"" said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics.

""This suggests that a substantial part of Credit Suisse's $570bn assets may be either impaired or perceived as being at risk of becoming impaired. This could set in train renewed jitters about the health of banks.""

Shearing added that there may yet be risks to the deal ""for legal or financial reasons, or if confidence in UBS is dented and it gets cold feet about the deal.""

""Only time will tell how this shotgun wedding is received,"" he added.

The AT1 bond issue

As part of the deal, Swiss regulator FINMA announced the wipeout of 16 billion Swiss francs' worth of Credit Suisse's Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds, which some investors fear signals further spillover risk for global credit.

This was a major focal point for analysts assessing the potential ramifications on Monday morning.

""AT1 bonds were introduced in Europe after the global financial crisis to serve as shock absorbers when banks start to fail,"" explained Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer at Syz Bank.

""They are designed to impose permanent losses on bondholders or be converted into equity if a bank's capital ratios fall below a predetermined level, effectively propping up its balance sheet and allowing it to stay in business. According to the Swiss bail-in regime, AT1 debt is above equity in the loss absorption waterfall.""",['Elliot Smith'],2023-03-20 00:00:00

Credit Suisse , the collapsed Swiss bank taken over by UBS Group in a hastily arranged bailout earlier this month, may bring with it a fresh set of regulatory and legal problems for its new owner. For years, the bank has provided a safe haven for wealthy American clients to hide assets from the IRS — even after it was caught and prosecuted for doing the same thing more than a decade ago, according two former Credit Suisse bankers who spoke in exclusive interviews with CNBC and are working with the U.S. government as whistleblowers. related investing news Investors are jumping back into bank ETFs ahead of earnings season The bank notoriously pleaded guilty in 2014 to criminal charges for ""knowingly and willfully"" helping thousands of U.S. clients conceal their offshore assets and income from the IRS. It admitted at the time that it used sham entities, destroyed account records, and hand delivered cash to American clients to avert IRS detection — agreeing to crack down on U.S. tax dodgers going forward as part of its plea deal. Credit Suisse also agreed at the time to a host of reforms, including disclosing its cross-border activities and cooperating with authorities when they request information, among other things. The now troubled bank appears to have violated that agreement, according to a new report by the Senate Finance Committee that details ongoing and rampant abuse since then. The report, released Wednesday, details the findings of the panel's two-year investigation and takes on more urgency given the looming banking crisis. The Swiss National Bank, the country's central bank, injected more than $100 billion of liquidity into Credit Suisse to keep it afloat earlier this month, while the Swiss government agreed to provide UBS with some $9 billion to backstop losses resulting from the takeover.

Senate investigators say the new revelations raise questions about just how much American money remains hidden inside the vaults of a bank whose collapse rattled the foundations of the global banking system. The Senate report, which was prepared by the panel's Democratic staff, accuses the bank of violating the terms of its 2014 plea agreement, which could trigger a host of repercussions if the Justice Department presses the case. It is unclear how much potential liability UBS is exposed to as a result of the report, but a lawyer for the whistleblowers argues the bank should pay as much as $1.3 billion. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said his committee had received new information just this week from Credit Suisse about additional American undisclosed accounts that the bank held after 2014. ""It is still going on as of just the last couple of days — even more money has been found to have been concealed and there are very substantial issues here,"" Wyden said. ""Clearly, it's time to prosecute and ensure that there are penalties that send a strong message."" ""Credit Suisse employees aided and abetted a major criminal tax evasion scheme,"" a finance committee aide said, asking not to be named because the report had not been released yet. ""To date, no Credit Suisse employees involved in the scheme have faced any consequences from the United States government for their participation.""

Hiding fortunes

Senate investigators say they discovered that Credit Suisse enabled as many as 25 American families to hide fortunes totaling more than $700 million in the bank in the years after Credit Suisse's plea agreement. ""They thought they could get away with it, and they largely did,"" the aide said. ""It's not a question of whether Swiss banks continue to do this, it's a question of which Swiss banks still do this."" In a statement to CNBC, a Credit Suisse spokeswoman said it does not tolerate tax evasion. ""In its core, the report describes legacy issues, some from a decade ago, and we have implemented extensive enhancements since then to root out individuals who seek to conceal assets from tax authorities,"" the spokeswoman said, asking not to be identified because she was not authorized to speak on the record. She said the bank's new leadership team has been cooperating with the committee. Credit Suisse has ""supported the work of Senator Wyden, including in respect of suggested policy solutions to help strengthen the financial industry's ability to detect undisclosed US persons."" She said the bank's policy requires it to close undeclared accounts when they're identified and discipline employees who don't follow its policy.

The two former Credit Suisse employees, who worked as whistleblowers with the U.S. government and Senate investigators, told CNBC some of the bad behavior continued long after Credit Suisse's 2014 plea agreement. CNBC agreed to mask their identities on camera and to maintain their anonymity because they say they fear retaliation from the bank. They were interviewed in the weeks before Credit Suisse collapsed earlier this month. Although the bank did disclose and close many American accounts after its 2014 plea agreement, some bankers worked with high net worth clients to keep certain Americans at the bank, by changing the nationalities listed on their accounts and ignoring evidence that the account holders were Americans. In other cases, they helped American clients move money to other banks, without reporting those transfers to U.S. authorities, the whistleblowers say.

The report and interviews offer a rare look at the inner workings of the secretive Swiss banking, a world rarely penetrated by outsiders. And they show how compliance systems inside Credit Suisse broke down in the years before its collapse this month and rescue by the Swiss government and rival bank UBS. Bankers are under constant pressure, the whistleblowers said, to keep and bring in deposits at the bank. ""You're under tremendous pressure to bring in these net new assets, which ultimately translate into revenue,"" the first whistleblower said in describing a culture where bankers were expected to keep the assets of wealthy clients inside the bank, even if they had to cheat to do it. ""And that's the reason for the fraud. You don't want to lose assets. So, what you do is you try to maintain them in any way, shape, or form."" Senior executives would call out individual bankers at quarterly meetings where they would read out the asset numbers for each banker. If a banker's number declined, the second whistleblower said, ""you'd get exposed in front of your colleagues."" And as a result, he said, ""there may come moments where people simply omit saying things."" ""'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' is maybe a good explanation to what happened,"" he said. ""They would have clients that are Americans, but they would switch their passports around to show and flag as if they are not."" Credit Suisse bankers, for instance, repeatedly flew to Miami to meet with American clients and yet failed to flag them as U.S. citizens, Senate investigators said. Secrecy drives the entire Swiss banking industry, the first whistleblower said – to a point that the sector may not be able to survive without it. ""Swiss banks are much more expensive, and there's a reason for that,"" he said. ""If you could choose anywhere in the world you want to be, why would you pay more? Why would you be in a place which underperforms in terms of your return on assets?"" If a client isn't hiding assets in Switzerland, the first whistleblower said, ""there's no other reason to be there.""

Emails obtained by the Senate Finance committee show just how far the bankers went to keep identities secret and to ensure wealthy Americans were able to switch nationalities — at least for the bank's internal record-keeping. In one email, one of Credit Suisse's banker writes to another bank employee, ""please don't write or document these topics."" One American client, an heir to a $200 million fortune deposited at Credit Suisse, emailed to say they renounced their U.S. citizenship. ""I tried to reach you, congratulation!!!!!"" their private banker emailed back. ""This is a big step for you and I know it was not easy."" The heir to the fortune replied, ""Thanks … hopefully this should also make Credit Suisse now more relaxed."" The heir closed the message with a smiley face.

The Family

""The committee's investigation uncovered major violations of Credit Suisse's plea agreement, including an ongoing and potentially criminal tax conspiracy involving nearly $100 million dollars and undeclared offshore accounts belonging to a family of dual U.S./Latin American citizens,"" a committee aide told CNBC. The aide said Credit Suisse closed accounts held by that family worth nearly $100 million in 2013 and moved funds to other banks in Switzerland and elsewhere, but did not inform U.S. authorities about the transfer of assets until 2021 – which was months after whistleblowers informed U.S. authorities of the existence of the accounts. In the Senate report the clients are not named, but simply referred to as ""The Family."" While it's legal for Americans to hold funds in foreign bank accounts, they must file forms with the IRS disclosing the assets and pay taxes on any relevant gains. Americans must file a disclosure document called a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, which is referred to in the industry as an ""FBAR."" The committee said the family held assets at Credit Suisse dating as far back as 1979, and they found evidence Credit Suisse bankers visited members in the family in Miami as early as 2000, holding meetings at the Mandarin Oriental hotel and enjoying meals at The Capital Grille restaurant in Miami's fashionable Brickell neighborhood overlooking Biscayne Bay. But aides say they didn't find any evidence the family ever filed required paperwork with the U.S. government or paid taxes on their assets. Instead, the assets were held under one family member's dual Latin American passport.

Legal jeopardy

As a result, the aide said, ""They're potentially in legal jeopardy, to put it mildly."" Committee aides say the family's assets were overseen by a high-level Credit Suisse executive in its Latin American division, and that official participated in the meetings in Miami. That's notable, aides said, because that same official was the supervisor of several other Credit Suisse bankers who were previously indicted in connection with the 2014 American offshore accounts. Committee aides complained that Credit Suisse declined to provide the names of any of the employees involved or the Swiss banks that received the funds – but said they were able to determine that information through other sources. The Miami case ""is not small potatoes,"" a Senate aide said. If proven, it ""would be one of the largest FBAR violations in United States history."" Former Justice Department prosecutor Jeffrey Neiman, who is representing the whistleblowers, said he believes fraud is still ongoing and the DOJ should claw back hundreds of millions of dollars in fines that the bank agreed to pay in 2014, but ultimately didn't have to pay. The bank agreed to pay $2.6 billion, but a federal judge only imposed a penalty of $1.3 billion at the time. ""I think Credit Suisse is aware of Americans who are still hiding money today. And I think the bank is doing whatever it can to contain whatever this damage is,"" Neiman said.

$1.3 billion

""At a minimum, the U.S. government needs to collect that $1.3 billion for the American taxpayers. This bank needs to be made an example of,"" he said. ""We hear tough talk out of the Justice Department about holding repeat corporate offenders accountable. Let's see if those words have actual meaning."" The whistleblowers stand to gain financially if there are further payments to the U.S. government. Under the law, whistleblowers stand to collect between 15% and 30% of any money recovered by the U.S. government as a direct result of information they provide. The Senate Finance Committee doesn't think U.S. prosecutors have gone far enough in holding Credit Suisse accountable, the aide said. The report is part of a campaign to up the pressure on the DOJ to crack down on the Swiss bank, and the recent takeover of the bank puts it squarely in the spotlight. ""DOJ must correct its lax oversight of Credit Suisse and hold Credit Suisse accountable for any violations of its plea agreement,"" he said. The aide cited recent indications of a white-collar crackdown. ""DOJ said we will go after anybody at banks who commits tax evasion,"" the aide said. ""Then do it. We're going to drop you twelve names in this report. Go after them."" The Justice Department declined to comment when contacted for this story.

About the Lawsuits

Credit Suisse and certain of its executives are charged with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws.

On February 9, 2023, the Company announced its 2022 financial results, disclosing that, contrary to its prior statements, it had continued to experience large customer outflows through yearend 2022, specifically, outflows of 110.5 billion Swiss francs in the final three months of 2022, a figure which far exceeded market expectations. On this news, shares of Credit Suisse fell $0.56 per ADS, or 15.64%, to close at $3.02 per ADS on February 9, 2023. Then, on March 15, 2023, news media sources revealed that the Company's ""biggest backer,"" Saudi National Bank, would not buy any more of the Company's shares on regulatory grounds. On this news, shares of Credit Suisse fell 13.94% to close at $2.16 per ADS.

The case is Calhoun v. Credit Suisse Group AG, et al., No. 23-cv-01297.

A subsequently-filed case, Turner v. Credit Suisse Group AG, et al., No. 23-cv-01476, expanded the class period.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/16/investing/why-credit-suisse-is-struggling/index.html,Credit Suisse: Why it’s struggling and why that’s a big deal,"New York CNN —

Credit Suisse, the 167-year-old bank and the second-largest lender in Switzerland, is in deep trouble.

The bank said it would borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($53.7 billion) from the Swiss National Bank, taking advantage of a lifeline late Wednesday after its stock crashed as much as 30%. It also said it would buy back some of its own debt.

Its struggles set off anxiety in Europe and across global markets, and what happens at Credit Suisse could impact the broader financial system.

Why does Credit Suisse matter?

Credit Suisse is one of the biggest financial institutions in the world.

It is categorized by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the financial system, as a “global systemically important bank,” along with just 30 others, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and the Bank of China.

“Credit Suisse is in principle a much bigger concern for the global economy than the regional US banks which were in the firing line last week,” Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics said in a note to clients Wednesday. “Credit Suisse is much more globally interconnected … not just a Swiss problem but a global one.”

Why is Credit Suisse struggling now?

Central banks around the world have been raising interest rates to try to slow down inflation and cool the global economy.

But that process has left some banks vulnerable.

Fears about weaker lenders exploded last week when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in the biggest US banking failure since the 2008 financial crisis. That engulfed other banks facing big problems, including Credit Suisse, which has been a slow-moving car wreck for decades.

“The problems at Credit Suisse are very different to those that brought down SVB a few days ago,” economists at Capital Economics said in an email to clients Thursday. “But they serve as a reminder that as interest rates rise, vulnerabilities are lurking in the financial system.”

The trigger for Wednesday’s rout in Credit Suisse shares wasn’t rising rates. It came from comments by the bank’s biggest backer — the Saudi National Bank — that it wasn’t prepared to put up more money after buying a near-10% stake for $1.5 billion last year.

What was going on Credit Suisse before this meltdown?

Credit Suisse has been struggling for years.

It was widely seen as the weakest link among Europe’s large banks, according to Kenningham.

The company has been plagued by a series of missteps and compliance failures in recent years that cost it billions and led to several overhauls of top management. And over the past decade, the Swiss bank has been hit with fines and penalties related to tax evasion, misplaced bets and other issues.

In 2014, Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to federal charges that it illegally allowed some U.S. clients to evade their taxes. The bank paid a total of $2.6 billion to the federal government and New York financial regulators as part of the settlement.

The bank’s reputation was damaged by an accounting scandal at Luckin Coffee. Credit Suisse acted as an underwriter when the company went public on the Nasdaq in 2019. The Chinese firm was pulled off the US exchange after it fraudulently inflated sales.

In 2020, Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam resigned after two high-profile spying scandals involving top bank officials.

A year later, the collapse of the US hedge fund Archegos Capital cost Credit Suisse $5.5 billion and damaged the bank. An independent external investigation later found that Credit Suisse allowed Archegos Capital to take “voracious” and “potentially catastrophic” risks that culminated in the US hedge fund’s spectacular collapse.

In 2022, the bank was hit by social media speculation that it was on the brink of collapse, leading customers to withdraw billions of dollars. That has made profitability a near impossibility for the bank, which has been hemorrhaging money for years.

And last month, Credit Suisse’s stock plunged to record lows after it posted its biggest annual loss since the financial crisis in 2008 and a report surfaced that regulators were reviewing comments the lender’s chairman made about the health of its finances.

What’s next for Credit Suisse?

The lifeline from the Swiss National Bank could buy time for Credit Suisse to restore confidence and push on with restructuring plans that include carving out investment banking into an independent US-based business and focusing on Switzerland as well as on managing money for wealthy clients.

But Credit Suisse may not be out of the woods yet.

JPMorgan’s banking analysts said the liquidity support offered by the Swiss central bank would not be sufficient, given “ongoing market confidence issues” with Credit Suisse’s investment banking plans and the erosion of the bank’s franchise.

“In our view, status quo is no longer an option as counterparty concerns are starting to emerge as reflected by credit/equity markets weakness,” they wrote in a research note Thursday, adding that a takeover — most likely by bigger Swiss rival UBS — was the most likely endgame.

However, the downward spiral of Credit Suisse's share price and mounting asset outflows were underway long before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this month. Swiss regulator FINMA has come under fire for allowing the situation to deteriorate as the bank spent years mired in losses and scandal. Mark Yallop, chairman of the U.K.'s Financial Markets Standards Board and former U.K. CEO at UBS, told CNBC on Tuesday that he agreed with the broad assessment that Credit Suisse's downfall was ""idiosyncratic."" ""It's unfortunate that the problems with some of the smaller U.S. banks in the last two or three weeks happened at the same time as this issue with Credit Suisse but the two are completely different and very largely unrelated,"" he said. ""The issues at Credit Suisse are to do with a long history of revolving doors at the top of the firm in management terms, a changing plan, and on top of a series of operational risk and control and compliance problems."" The final straw that sent the share price to an all-time low ahead of a 50 billion loan from the SNB last Thursday, which ultimately failed to restore market confidence in the bank, was the announcement from top investor the Saudi National Bank that it could not provide any more funding to Credit Suisse.

""One never knows with a bank collapse when the moment of crisis will come, but at that point, that was the moment when investors finally threw in the towel and said enough is enough, and the actions that we saw over the weekend became pretty much inevitable,"" Yallop added. What's more, swift action from Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department has largely been credited with successfully stemming any potential contagion to the U.S. financial system, which begs the question of how much of the blame for Credit Suisse's demise can really be apportioned to the SVB collapse. By contrast, the Swiss banking and regulatory system has come under fire. Steven Glass, managing director and analyst at Pella Funds Management, told CNBC last week that the plunge in Credit Suisse's share price had been a long time coming, and that the loss of confidence of clients was actually crystalized by the bank's exposure to the Greensill Capital collapse in 2021. ""The problem with Greensill, it was actually a huge issue, because that fund was marketed to a whole lot of [Credit Suisse's] high-net-worth individual clients as a very safe fund, as a way to get yield in a low-yield world, and when that blew up, a whole lot of their franchise lost money and they basically lost trust in Credit Suisse,"" Glass told CNBC's ""Capital Connection.""

FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images

UBS sought to reassure investors at its annual general meeting on Wednesday against a fraught political backdrop following its takeover of fallen rival Credit Suisse last month. The 1,128 shareholders gathered in Basel were looking for clarity on the board's integration plan after the ""shotgun wedding"" between Switzerland's two biggest banks, which remains mired in controversy, legal peril and public skepticism. UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher told the audience that March 19, the date of the emergency rescue of Credit Suisse from the brink of collapse, was a ""historic day and a day we hoped would never come."" But he said the merger also presents ""a new beginning and huge opportunities ahead for the combined bank and the Swiss financial sector as a whole."" He emphasized UBS' continued focus on its wealth management and Swiss business and confirmed that the bank would reduce the capital allocated to its investment arm to below 25% of risk-weighted assets. ""Whilst we did not initiate these discussions, we believe that this transaction is financially attractive to UBS shareholders,"" Kelleher said, while acknowledging there is a ""huge amount of risk"" associated with the integration.

watch now

The Credit Suisse integration is expected to take around three to four years, excluding Credit Suisse's non-core investment bank portfolio. Kelleher said the bank expects to remain well capitalized and ""significantly above"" its capital targets by the time the deal closes. New UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti began his second tenure on Wednesday after his shock reappointment last week, with the board having decided that he was the right man to lead the mammoth task of integrating the bank's fallen compatriot's business. Ermotti's return was seen by many commentators as an attempt to restore calm, as the country's long-established reputation for financial stability teeters on the brink. UBS reported a full-year profit of $7.6 billion in 2022, and its shares remain up more than 10% since the turn of the year. Concerns remain over the scale of the new entity, which will have more than $5 trillion in total invested assets, and whether it creates too much concentrated risk for the Swiss and global economy.

watch now

Reports have suggested that UBS' plans may include job cuts of around 20-30% of the combined entity's global workforce, but the bank's Vice Chairman said Wednesday that it was too early to offer any concrete estimates. Credit Suisse held the final independent AGM in its 167-year history in Zurich on Tuesday, after Swiss authorities brokered an ""emergency rescue"" in late March, when the bank's share price tumbled and depositors fled en masse. The board was angrily confronted on Tuesday by shareholders demanding answers and accountability over the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.3 billion) deal, which was rushed through over the course of a weekend and denied both UBS and Credit Suisse shareholders a vote. Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann said he was ""truly sorry"" to shareholders, clients and employees, and suggested the bank's turnaround plan after years of losses, scandals and compliance failures had been on track until turmoil in the U.S. banking sector sparked a flight of confidence.

https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2023/04/deutsche-bank-hiring-from-credit-suisse,Deutsche Bank is spending millions hiring from Credit Suisse,"When Deutsche Bank announced its first quarter results in February, it was ambiguous about its plans for jobs. On one hand, CEO Christian Sewing said the bank couldn't guarantee that it wouldn't be reducing headcount. On the other, Sewing said it wanted to grow. Two months later, there's less ambivalence: Deutsche Bank is still hiring, and it's doing so from Credit Suisse.

Deutsche has spent millions hiring from its Swiss rival. The German bank is known for paying comparatively high salaries of around $500k to managing directors. It's recruited at least 10 senior people from Credit Suisse in the past six months.

Nor is stopping now. Alessandro Pelleriti, the Credit Suisse credit trader who resigned in February, has just joined Deutsche Bank. So too has William Mansfield, Credit Suisse's recently promoted head of EMEA M&A. So too has Lim Zi-Kuan, Credit Suisse's head of M&A for South East Asia, who joined Deutsche Bank as head of M&A for Asia after resigning earlier this month.

Deutsche Bank's latest flotilla of post-UBS Credit Suisse hires comes after all the other people it hired from CS as the bank began sinking below the surface. They include: Karen Miles, Credit Suisse's ex- EMEA head of high yield trading; Diego Discepoli, the ex-head of Credit Suisse's global credit products business in EMEA; Jonathan Moore, the incredibly popular person once in charge of global credit at Credit Suisse; and Vivek Nahar, once of Credit Suisse's top producers and the former head of high yield sales.

While Deutsche is likely to have picked up some of these people cheaply (Nahar was inexplicably let go by CS, for example), it will also have bought others out of their cash bonuses, which are repayable plus income tax when people leave. Markets professionals at Credit Suisse didn't receive much in the way of bonuses for last year, but bankers were better rewarded as the bank sought to retain them for the deceased CS First Boston project.

Deutsche is unlikely to be done with its CS hiring. People like John Estrada, Credit Suisse's global head of FX, could also be on its shopping list. Russell LaScala, Deutsche's London-based head of FX retired this month and although his seat has been filled internally, DB may feel that it's worth availing itself of more cheap talent from its struggling soon to be ex-rival.

UBS took over Credit Suisse on Sunday in a £2.65bn deal forced through by Swiss authorities amid fears that a failure to protect depositors would kickstart a global banking crisis.

In a letter to staff seen by the Guardian, the Credit Suisse group chief executive, Ulrich Körner, said it had “been an emotional and challenging week for all of us. He thanked employees for their “unwavering commitment and for the support you have given our clients and each other during this difficult time”.

Korner said the deal with UBS had been the “only viable option” and it “brings both stability and certainty to our clients and to the market”.

Switzerland’s government said earlier this week that Credit Suisse was ordered to temporarily suspend bonus payments awarded in the years up to 2022.

In the letter, Körner acknowledged concerns about the ban among its 45,000-strong workforce and said discussions concerning the matter with Swiss authorities were “ongoing”. There are more than 5,000 Credit Suisse and about 6,000 UBS staff based in London. “We do not yet have an answer, but we know how important this is for many of you,” he said.

Korner said that a deal of the scale of the UBS merger would typically take six months to agree, but the emergency transaction had taken just four days, leaving many practicalities unresolved.

He said: “Until the transaction legally closes later this year, we remain two independent banks and must continue to work that way. Please stay focused on our clients and continue to provide them with the outstanding service they expect from us.”

Körner, who become chief executive in July 2022 after former boss Thomas Gottstein was ousted, said he remains “fully committed” to the bank. “I will be at your side as we work to make the transaction a success,” he said.

The UBS deal was agreed after it became clear the $54bn loan to Credit Suisse from the Swiss central bank had failed to halt a sharp slide in its share price.

The finance ministry has confirmed that two legal actions have been filed against the state-backed rescue of Credit Suisse, which wiped out CHF16 billion ($17.9 billion) of risky bonds.

This content was published on April 16, 2023 minutes

swissinfo.ch/dos

The SonntagsZeitung newspaper writes that various other investors are also examining how to appeal the controversial decision to wipe out the value of AT1 (Additional Tier One Capital) bonds during the emergency takeover by UBS last month.

+ All the latest updates on the Credit Suisse crisisExternal link

Law professor Thomas Werlen, who represents international legal firm Quinn Emanuel in Switzerland, told the paper that complaints may appeal to the terms of international investment protection treaties, which foresee reparations in the case of state expropriation.

Switzerland has signed over 100 such agreements with countries around the world.

Swiss financial regulator FINMA has maintained that it was contractually stipulated that the AT1 bonds would be written off in the case of a “viability” or emergency event – “in particular if extraordinary government support is granted”.

FINMA says that this “viability event” took place on Sunday, March 19, the day of the historic UBS deal.

CHF8 billion risk

But the SonntagsZeitung says questions remain about whether – and when exactly – Credit Suisse was actually insolvent, rather than illiquid, and thus entitled to wipe out the bonds.

The newspaper adds that the result of legal cases – should the Swiss state be found to have wrongly expropriated the bondholders – could be a bill of CHF8 billion, i.e. the market value of the AT1 bonds on March 17.

The write-down of the bonds, while Credit Suisse shareholders received payouts at the stock’s takeover value, was a reversal of normal investor hierarchies and was subsequently questioned by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank.

There is no cost or obligation to you.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading minority and Woman-owned national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia.

As detailed below, the lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) contrary to Defendant Lehmann's representations in December 2022, the sharp increase in customer outflows Credit Suisse began experiencing in October 2022 remained ongoing; (2) accordingly, Credit Suisse had downplayed the impact of the Company's recent series of quarterly losses and risk and compliance failures on liquidity and its ability to retain client funds; (3) as a result, Credit Suisse had overstated the Company's financial position and/or prospects; and (4) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On February 9, 2023, Credit Suisse issued a press release announcing its 2022 financial results. The press release revealed that, contrary to Defendant Lehmann's prior statements, large customer outflows had continued through yearend 2022. Specifically, the press release reported customer outflows of 110.5 billion Swiss francs in the final three months of 2022, a figure which far exceeded market expectations.

On this news, Credit Suisse's ADS price fell $0.56 per ADS, or 15.64%, to close at $3.02 per ADS on February 9, 2023.

Then, on February 21, 2023, Reuters reported that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (""FINMA""), was reviewing Defendant Lehmann's previous comments regarding customer outflows.

On this news, Credit Suisse's ADS price fell another $0.10 per ADS, or 3.31%, to close at $2.92 per ADS on February 21, 2023.

As a result of Defendants' wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company's securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/04/credit-suisse-chair-truly-sorry-over-downfall-of-167-year-old-bank-ubs,Furious Credit Suisse investors say bank’s board should be ‘put behind bars’,"Furious Credit Suisse investors at its final ever annual meeting blocked executive pay plans and called for board members to be “put behind bars”, as the Swiss lender’s chair said he was “truly sorry” over the bank’s demise.

Shareholders used most of the nearly five-hour annual general meeting in Zurich – the last in the 167-year-old bank’s history – to voice fury over poor management, hitting out at excessive pay for “incompetent and greedy” bankers who they said took too many risks and endangered Switzerland’s economic prosperity.

Board members were also criticised for being too quick to agree to its takeover by UBS last month and striking a bad deal for investors, although bosses said the only alternative was bankruptcy. “This is a dishonourable day for Switzerland,” one investor said. “I believe we have basically lost trust in the Swiss financial sector.”

Another lamented the collapse of its shares, which he said were now worth no more than a “sack of walnuts”, and offered some shells as a gift to the chair, Axel Lehmann. Another said it meant livelihoods of pensioners who relied on Credit Suisse stock had “gone up in smoke”, and warned that people “might even think of killing themselves because they no longer have any money left”.

He said the board needed to be held responsible for the many scandals that plagued the bank, including tax evasion and fraud. “These people should be taken to court, should be put behind bars, and should no longer be allowed to practise their profession,” the shareholder said.

Investors still narrowly approved the re-election of a slimmed-down board, as well as any pay they are due for helping UBS absorb its Swiss rival. That includes Lehmann, who gained approval for re-election from nearly 55.7% of shareholders.

However, executives were not so lucky. In a final rebellion, 48.4% of shareholders rejected a proposal to collectively pay executives up to 34m Swiss francs – £30m – over the next year, including for any work involving the merger. Only 48.2% approved the plan.

It was not immediately clear whether that would mean remaining executives having to work for free. “The board will assess this result and will determine potential further measures,” Credit Suisse said in a statement.

The investor anger came despite apologies from Lehmann, who insisted bosses had had legitimate plans to turn the bank around but had been “thwarted” by market panic over the wider health of the global banking sector, after the collapse of the US tech lender Silicon Valley Bank days earlier.

He said the bank had “fought hard to find a solution” but had ultimately been left with two options: either strike a deal with UBS or declare bankruptcy.

“We wanted to put all our energy and our efforts into turning the situation around,” Lehmann said. “It pains me that we didn’t have the time to do so in that fateful week in March our plans were thwarted. And for that I am truly sorry.”

He added: “I apologise that we were no longer able to stem the loss of trust that had accumulated over the years and for disappointing you.”

Credit Suisse was sold to UBS through a Swiss government-orchestrated emergency takeover on 19 March as panic over the health of the financial system swelled after the collapse of SVB that month.

The Swiss lender had long been struggling to keep customers and turn profits after a prolonged series of scandals, compliance problems and bad financial bets. However, confidence was almost wiped out in mid-March after its largest shareholder, the Saudi National Bank, ruled out providing further funding because of regulations that in effect capped its investment.

The Swiss authorities stepped in, originally offering a 50bn Swiss franc (£45bn) line of credit, and eventually ushering in a takeover by Credit Suisse’s larger domestic rival UBS four days later.

Credit Suisse’s chief executive, Ulrich Körner, told shareholders he understood their disappointment. “After 167 years, Credit Suisse is giving up its independence.”

However, Lehmann said the only other option would have been bankruptcy. “This would have led to the worst scenario: namely a total loss for shareholders, unpredictable risks for clients, severe consequences for the economy and the global financial markets,” he said.",['Kalyeena Makortoff'],2023-04-04 00:00:00

With UBS having absorbed a discounted Credit Suisse, Swiss regulators have an even bigger bank to supervise (Peace-loving/shutterstock.com)

In the wake of the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse (CS), the narrative that the two banks were special cases—so one could therefore return to business as usual—quickly gained ground. On closer inspection, however, this is far from being valid, at least for CS.

True, the bank has a long history of mismanagement: involvement with the Bulgarian mafia from 2004 to 2007, dubious dealings involving a British subsidiary in Mozambique in 2011 and losses at the hedge funds Archegos and Greensill in 2021. And it is probably not wrong to report a ‘general rip-off mentality’ among its managers.

Recent problems should not however be reduced to past mistakes—or excessive management remuneration. The bank was not operating in a vacuum: it was under the constant supervision and monitoring of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB). In the event of chronic concerns, it was up to these institutions to urge remedial action.

‘Well placed to cope’

Yet in its financial-stability report last September, referring also to UBS, the SNB declared:

The capital position of both banks has improved further since the last Financial Stability Report. The capital ratios of Credit Suisse and UBS exceed the requirements under the Swiss ‘too big to fail’ (TBTF) regulations and are above average by international comparison.

The report also presented very positively the outcomes of stress test conducted by the SNB: ‘The results of the stress scenario analysis indicate that, thanks to their capital buffers, the two globally active Swiss banks are well placed to cope with severely adverse developments in economic and financial conditions.’

And despite all the mismanagement, the CS annual report published last month showed the bank still had 45 billion Swiss francs in equity at the end of 2022. Its auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, confirmed in that report that everything was in order. Since CS was sold to UBS shortly afterwards for only CHF3 billion, the question arises as to how such a massive loss in value—in less than three months—might be explained.

Real causes

What were the real causes of the bank’s collapse? There is no doubt it was triggered by massive withdrawals by depositors who feared losing their money in the face of so much negative news. But this was also addressed by the SNB in its stability report. In the event of ‘liquidity shocks’, it said it would provide additional liquidity, in its capacity as ‘lender of last resort’, against sufficient collateral.

This corresponds to the textbook procedure for a banking crisis, based on distinguishing solvency and liquidity problems. A bank that is insolvent, being over-indebted, must be closed or restructured immediately. A solvent bank, on the other hand, which becomes illiquid due to a withdrawal of deposits triggered by psychological factors, presents a scenario for the central bank to step in as lender of last resort. As long as the bank is sufficiently capitalised, the central bank should be able to keep it alive with liquidity assistance.

If the accounts are correct, CS was a solvent bank with above-average capital adequacy, at least until the end of 2022. As late as March 15th 2023, the SNB and FINMA explicitly affirmed that CS met the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks. If necessary, the SNB would provide liquidity.

The fundamental problem, therefore, is that the Swiss authorities were not able to rescue CS, despite their statements to the contrary, resulting in a huge loss of capital for shareholders and subordinated debt holders. For Switzerland, this raises the question of how to reform its authorities, which were incapable of recognising the bank’s problems and ensuring its survival, so that they may adequately supervise the new, extra-large UBS and effectively stabilise it in the event of a run.

No all-clear

Beyond Switzerland, the collapse of CS shows that even an above-average capital base is no guarantee of a bank’s stability in a crisis—and that stress tests, however important, should not be overestimated. If the Swiss authorities were unable to deal with a serious liquidity problem, moreover, couldn’t something similar happen in other countries?

So there is still no reason to sound the all-clear on global financial markets. The abrupt rise in central-bank policy rates since last year is a major challenge for the banking system. During the years of low interest rates, many institutions were generous in granting long-term loans, especially for housing, which are now yielding low returns. At the same time, they have been refinancing themselves with very short-term deposits.

As long as depositors remain calm, this is not a problem. But if confidence in a bank wanes, the only way for it to attract new funds is to pay the currently very high short-term interest rates for them. A liquidity problem can then quickly become a solvency issue.

This creates a conflict of objectives for central banks. Still unchecked ‘core’ inflation (excluding energy and food) argues for maintenance of a restrictive monetary policy but this increases tensions in the financial system.

This trade-off cannot be resolved but central banks can mitigate it by working with governments to make clear that solvent institutions can count on full liquidity support. In particular, the scope of government deposit insurance could be increased, at least temporarily, to reduce the risk of destabilising withdrawals in the first place.

Fundamental question

Given the complexity of global financial institutions, the more fundamental question arises as to how outsiders entrusting their money to a bank should be able to judge its quality and so impose what the literature calls ‘market discipline’. The World Bank defines this thus: ‘Market discipline refers to the process by which market participants, such as depositors and shareholders, monitor banks’ risks and take action to limit excessive risk-taking.’

Customers can certainly monitor their pizza bakers but when it comes to banks depositors are no more able to monitor the safety of the service than are the passengers of an airline. The design of institutional arrangements that provide absolutely safe assets for large depositors is therefore an open question.

The option of holding deposits directly with the central bank—a central-bank digital currency—would be very welcome. But so far, the European Central Bank’s plans for a digital euro envisage an upper limit of only €3,000, to avoid the bypassing (‘disintermediation’) of the banking system.

GENEVA (AP) — Fury at top Credit Suisse managers. Lament over damage to Switzerland’s image as a stable, reliable banking center. Relief that authorities stepped in to help protect deposits , but worry about keeping cash invested in a bank that failed to manage its own money adequately.

On Swiss streets, emotions were running the gamut among Credit Suisse customers after the government this weekend orchestrated a takeover of the country’s second-largest bank by rival UBS — a bid to prevent further upheaval in the global financial system that began with the collapse of two U.S. banks .

How the merger, with a fire-sale price of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion), will play out and its impact on worldwide finance are largely unknown. That has left those stuck in the middle — customers and bank workers — uncertain about what comes next in the deal to create one Swiss megabank.

“My money is already invested in two or three banking establishments,” customer Elisabeth Pictet said after exiting the biggest Credit Suisse branch in central Geneva. “I am not a millionaire, but it is true that in the long run maybe I will even more favor local, regional banking establishments.”

Pictet — whose husband hails from a legendary banking family in Switzerland — said she’s not gotten any communication from the bank about how to proceed but praised the government for a “wise decision” that reassured many Swiss residents like her. She said Tuesday that she’s had no trouble withdrawing cash.

“I feel a lot of anger at Credit Suisse managers because in the end, their employees will lose their jobs — many employees who did their work professionally,” said Pictet, 59, who is transitioning into retirement from a health care job. “Now, we’ll only have a single big bank — UBS — and that is not good: It’s good to have competition, and we won’t have that anymore.”

Asked if Credit Suisse had told customers how to manage their assets since the deal emerged Sunday, a bank spokeswoman said that “until the transaction has closed, business continues as usual for Credit Suisse and its clients.”

That likely won’t be the case for Credit Suisse’s 50,000 workers, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland, as the two banks combine . The Swiss bank employee’s association is demanding that job losses be held to a minimum, that no layoffs happen until year’s end, and the government provide an unspecified jobs guarantee.

“It is impermissible that the companies are secured by tax dollars but the employees come away with nothing,” the group said in a prepared statement. “The billions in guarantees from the federal government must be linked to conditions favorable to the employees.”

The impact of the merger is extensive. Many of Switzerland’s 8.5 million people have accounts in either UBS or Credit Suisse.

“I myself am grateful as a customer that this worked out,” said Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter at a news conference Sunday to announce the hastily arranged deal.

She said she has accounts at both banks.

“I think what we have done now is really to protect those people who have money at Credit Suisse,” Keller-Sutter said, with small- and medium-size companies able to keep paying their workers, carry out transactions and access their savings.

Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas LLC, agreed that Credit Suisse depositors need not worry about their money now — though he noted reports of snap withdrawals worth billions of dollars last week amid confusion about the bank’s future.

The Swiss central bank and government have since guaranteed loans to the combined bank worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

“Basically, the Swiss National Bank has stepped in and said, ‘Your deposits are safe,’” said Marenzi, whose firm focuses on capital markets.

Bank runs are a risk for even the biggest and safest banks , but “with Credit Suisse, things look very, very safe indeed at this stage in terms of deposits. So I wouldn’t be in a rush to move money out of there,” he said.

It’s a different story for those who entrusted their money to Credit Suisse for wealth management or investment advice.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Those customers are scratching their heads and saying, ‘Well, if you can’t manage your own money, why would you be able to manage mine?’ And that’s a fair question,” Marenzi said.

Swiss regulators and officials, reportedly under intense pressure from other Western governments and ultra-rich investors, forged the Credit Suisse takeover by UBS in a bid to stop more banking-sector turmoil.

Credit Suisse’s problems — ranging from big losses on hedge fund bets to a spying scandal and failing to prevent money laundering by a Bulgarian cocaine ring — predated the recent collapse of U.S. banks but drew fears about its vulnerability.

For some in Geneva, there was sentimentality about the looming disappearance of a storied Swiss bank whose origins date to the budding railroad industry in the mid-19th century.

Credit Suisse customer Mokhtar Zada, 78, a retired former financial-sector worker originally from Afghanistan, said the demise of Credit Suisse wouldn’t affect him because he too has an account at UBS and could just transfer money to it if necessary.

ADVERTISEMENT

“But what a waste,” said Zada, clutching a Credit Suisse savings booklet that he first received in 1965 and had shown as a sort of souvenir to bank employees. “It’s really too bad that a bank with 170-odd years of history is going to vanish just like that.”

The US Fed said that the UBS Group had sought its approval to the deal on March 22.

As part of the deal, UBS will provide the Fed with “an implementation plan” for combining the US businesses of the two firms. The plan will be updated quarterly and will include UBS’ obligations to comply with more stringent “enhanced prudential standards”, the Fed said on Friday.

In a statement, the US Fed said the plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution. As per rules, the US central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

Last month, after the sudden collapse of US-based Silicon Valley Bank, investors lost confidence in Credit Suisse, which is Switzerland’s largest bank. In a matter of few days, Swiss authorities announced that UBS would buy Credit Suisse to contain further banking turmoil after the global lender had come to the brink of collapse. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets. Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

Besides the US, UBS secured temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, according to a report in Reuters.

Earlier this month, UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said that the unexpected takeover of rival Credit Suisse a significant milestone for Switzerland and for the global financial industry, which carries a “huge amount of risk”.

Addressing the annual shareholder meeting on April 5, Kelleher said that the takeover will take at least three to four years to take shape, excluding Credit Suisse’s non-core investment bank portfolio, which will have more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Describing the transaction as ""the first merger of two globally systematically important banks,"" Kelleher said the takeover ""means a new beginning and huge opportunities ahead for the combined bank and for the Swiss financial center as a whole.""

“Having a clear vision and a sound strategy is important….This transaction is the first merger of two global systemically important banks. This is not in any way an easy deal to do and brings with it execution risk,” Kelleher said.

A day before, Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann, while addressing the last AGM of the flagship bank, apologised to the shareholders for failing to contain the crisis, which led to its closure. In an emotional speech at Credit Suisse's last annual general meeting, chairman Axel Lehmann spoke of being caught off guard, pain, bitterness, accumulated scandals, and the grief that remains.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swiss-parliament-holds-emergency-session-082141792.html,Credit Suisse rescue receives initial snub from Swiss parliament,"By Noele Illien and John Revill

BERN (Reuters) -Switzerland's parliament on Tuesday failed to approve the 109 billion Swiss francs ($120.5 billion) of financial guarantees used to rescue Credit Suisse last month, in a first-round vote that was largely symbolic given the state had committed the funds.

The lower house retrospectively rejected the rescue near midnight, with heated debates continuing into the early hours of Wednesday morning as members discussed other measures related to Credit Suisse.

Earlier on Tuesday, Switzerland's upper house had approved the rescue, meaning the two chambers of the legislative body will vote again on Wednesday.

Lawmakers were recalled for a rare extraordinary session to discuss the rapid rescue of Credit Suisse and the Swiss government's open chequebook response to a collapse that many in the country have blamed on top management.

A shotgun marriage which saw Credit Suisse taken over by Zurich-based rival UBS for 3 billion Swiss francs and propped up with more than 250 billion Swiss francs in guarantees and support has been the subject of widespread criticism.

While earlier in the day, 29 of Switzerland's 46-member Council of States upper house approved the measure, it was later rejected with 102 of the 200-Member National Council voting against it.

The votes are, however, largely symbolic because the state committed the funds and lawmakers cannot overturn that decision.

In the lead-up to the merger last month, Swiss emergency law was used so that a sub-group of six members of parliament approved the financial commitment on behalf of the legislative body, to the ire of the almost 250 lawmakers left without a say.

""The use of emergency law has reached a level in the last three years that is beginning to annoy me,"" Hansjoerg Knecht, a member of Parliament's upper house, said.

Calling the situation where the legislative body can only approve the already committed credits ""unsatisfactory"", Knecht said if Credit Suisse was to require more cash, there should be no use of emergency law to bypass parliament.

Story continues

'LOTS OF QUESTIONS'

Switzerland's finance minister had addressed the Council of States before the vote and acknowledged the ire being voiced.

""I heard anger, I heard frustration, sometimes I also heard a bit of helplessness,"" Karin Keller-Sutter said, adding that the merger between historic cross-town rivals Credit Suisse and UBS was not a forced marriage, but one of convenience.

She also there needed to be a discussion around the kind of financial centre Switzerland wanted to be and whether it wanted to continue playing in the top league globally.

""What kind of consequences does this have for the financial regulator? For politics? These discussions need to be had. What do we really want and if we want that, we won't get there without carrying certain risk in future as well,"" she said.

A poll of Swiss economists found that nearly half thought the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS was not the best solution, warning the saga had dented Switzerland's reputation.

Celine Widmer, a Swiss National Council member for the left-leaning Social Democrats told Reuters ahead of the vote that ""lots of questions"" needed to be answered.

Politicians also questioned why the Swiss financial regulator was unable to prevent Credit Suisse's failure.

""Does FINMA need stronger instruments or have they done a bad job?"" Eva Herzog asked during a speech to the upper house.

Herzog is one of the six members of parliament who approved the rescue deal on behalf of the legislative body.

As part of the unusual event, the third such session in more than 20 years, the Swiss parliament had a chance to challenge the rushed rescue package and to discuss whether conditions could be imposed on Credit Suisse.

Last week, Switzerland announced it was cutting bonus payments for Credit Suisse's top management.

Credit Suisse's rescue angered not only politicians but many in Switzerland. A survey by political research firm gfs.bern found a majority of Swiss did not support the deal.

There are also growing worries about jobs and in an open letter to parliament, the Swiss Bank Employees' Association said that Credit Suisse and UBS must freeze any cuts.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse















ZURICH, March 26 (Reuters) - Swiss financial regulator FINMA said it was considering whether to take disciplinary action against Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) managers after Switzerland's second largest bank had to be rescued last week by UBS (UBSG.S).

FINMA President Marlene Amstad told Swiss newspaper NZZ am Sonntag it was ""still open"" whether new proceedings would be started, but the regulator's main focus was on ""the transitional phase of integration"" and ""preserving financial stability"".

UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.26 billion) in stock a week ago and to assume up to 5 billion francs in losses in a merger engineered by Swiss authorities during a period of market turmoil in global banking.

Credit Suisse on Sunday declined to comment on the FINMA President's comments when asked by Reuters for a response.

Asked whether FINMA is looking into holding current Credit Suisse managers accountable for the collapse of Switzerland's second-largest bank, Amstad said it is ""exploring the options"".

""CS had a cultural problem that translated into a lack of responsibilities,"" Amstad was quoted as saying by NZZ, adding: ""Numerous mistakes were made over several years"".

FINMA had conducted six public ""enforcement proceedings"" against Credit Suisse in recent years, Amstad said.

""We have intervened and used our strongest instruments,"" she said of its previous moves.

Amstad also defended Switzerland's decision to write down 16 billion Swiss francs of Credit Suisse Additional Tier 1 (AT1) debt, to zero as part of the forced rescue merger.

""The AT1 instruments contractually provide that they will be fully written off in the event of a trigger event, in particular the granting of extraordinary government support,"" Amstad said.

""The bonds were created precisely for such situations.""

In a separate interview with Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung, FINMA's CEO Urban Angehrn defended its role in dealing with Credit Suisse prior to the takeover.

""We intervened consistently in these cases, used our instruments, and they had an effect,"" he said. ""We do not run the bank, that responsibility lies with the board of directors and the management of the bank.""

Angehrn also said there are open discussions about widening FINMA's competencies, such as its ability to issue fines, which despite having ""sharp instruments"" it currently does not have.

""We do not have a ""senior managers regime"", which could help with the issue of manager responsibility, and FINMA is limited in communicating cases.""

The historic deal comes as major financial institutions continue to grapple with the fallout from the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this month, and work to stave off a broader crisis.

""This takeover was made possible with the support of the Swiss federal government, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA and the Swiss National Bank,"" the Swiss National Bank said in a statement. ""With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation.""

UBS will buy Credit Suisse for more than $3 billion, Credit Suisse said in a news release detailing the purchase, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. All of the bank's current shareholders will receive one share of UBS for around 22 1/2 shares of Credit Suisse, according to the release.

In a statement, Axel P. Lehmann, the chairman of Credit Suisse's board of directors, said ""the announced merger represents the best available outcome,"" citing ""recent extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances.""

""This has been an extremely challenging time for Credit Suisse and while the team has worked tirelessly to address many significant legacy issues and execute on its new strategy, we are forced to reach a solution today that provides a durable outcome,"" Lehmann's added.

At a news conference held Sunday afternoon to discuss the emergency purchase, Karin Keller-Sutter, president of FINMA, said ""Switzerland has to take responsibilities beyond its own borders,"" and added that the deal was reached in an effort to avoid ""irreparable economic turmoil in Switzerland and throughout the world."" Keller-Sutter said the purchase ""laid the foundations for greater stability both in Switzerland and internationally.""

Fears about the stability of the global banking system spread across the U.S. and Europe in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank's failures, which happened less than two weeks ago ago and within days of each other. Their closures prompted rare moves by the federal government as well as some of the largest U.S. banks to shore up finances at institutions that became threatened in the turmoil.

Credit Suisse received almost $54 billion last week from the Swiss national bank as part of those negotiations, while a consortium of 11 massive U.S. banks, including Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, agreed to provide $30 billion in funding for First Republic Bank. Those four banks each agreed to contribute $5 billion, while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley each agreed to give $2.5 billion and BNY Mellon, PNC Bank, State Street, Truist and U.S. Bank each agreed to give $1 billion.

The pledges of emergency funding on Thursday briefly interrupted what had been ongoing downturns in both banks' stocks, which resumed the following day. On Friday, Credit Suisse's share price slipped 7% and ended the day at $2.01.

For Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second-largest commercial bank, shares dropped 30% on the SIX stock exchange after its largest shareholder said it would not put any more money into the institution. The bank had faced problems before the U.S. banks' failures gave rise to fear and a lack of confidence among big investors, and it announced its plans to borrow up to 50 billion francs from the national bank on Thursday.

""This additional liquidity would support Credit Suisse's core businesses and clients as Credit Suisse takes the necessary steps to create a simpler and more focused bank built around client needs,"" said Credit Suisse in a statement at the time.

The steep drop-off in its share prices one day earlier marked a record-low for Credit Suisse, after the Saudi National Bank told news outlets that it would not inject additional funds into the institution as it sought to avoid regulations that would become applicable with a stake in the Swiss lender above 10%. That upheaval caused an automatic freeze in trading of shares of Credit Suisse on the Swiss market and significantly impacted shares of other large European banks, with some share prices falling by double-digits.

Despite the Swiss national bank's move to shore up finances at Credit Suisse, analysts at Capital Economics said concerns remained about the health of the institution, especially since it has not been profitable in two years.

Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in an investor note on Friday that, while Credit Suisse has a plan to restore business over the course of three years, ""it is uncertain whether markets will give it that long.""",['Emily Mae Czachor'],

Summary Companies UBS to pay 3 bln Swiss francs ($3.23 bln) for Credit Suisse

Yellen, Powell welcome deal to support financial stability

UBS to assume up to $5.4 bln in losses; deal to close this year

CS writes down $17 bln of bonds to zero, angering holders

S&P lowers First Republic Bank’s credit rating















March 19 (Reuters) - Some of the world's largest central banks came together on Sunday to stop a banking crisis from spreading as Swiss authorities persuaded UBS Group AG (UBSG.S) to buy rival Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S) in a historic deal.

UBS will pay 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.23 billion) for 167-year-old Credit Suisse and assume up to $5.4 billion in losses in a deal backed by a massive Swiss guarantee and expected to close by the end of 2023.

Soon after the announcement late on Sunday, the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and other major central banks came out with statements to reassure markets that have been walloped by a banking crisis that started with the collapse of two regional U.S. banks earlier this month.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures were each up 0.4%, both giving back some earlier gains. New Zealand dipped at the open and Australian shares (.AXJO) opened with a 0.5% loss. The safe-haven dollar lost ground against Sterling and the euro but was up versus the yen.

Pressure on UBS helped seal Sunday's deal.

""It's a historic day in Switzerland, and a day frankly, we hoped, would not come,"" UBS Chair Colm Kelleher told analysts on a conference call. ""I would like to make it clear that while we did not initiate discussions, we believe that this transaction is financially attractive for UBS shareholders,"" Kelleher said.

UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said there were still many details to be worked through.

""I know that there must be still questions that we have not been able to answer,"" he said. ""And I understand that and I even want to apologize for it.""

In a global response not seen since the height of the pandemic, the Fed said it had joined with central banks in Canada, England, Japan, the EU and Switzerland in a coordinated action to enhance market liquidity. The ECB vowed to support euro zone banks with loans if needed, adding the Swiss rescue of Credit Suisse was ""instrumental"" for restoring calm.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen welcomed the announcement by the Swiss authorities. The Bank of England also praised the Swiss.

“The greater risk environment for financials leads to husbanding of capital and risk-taking, less and more conservative investing and lending, and inevitably, lower growth,"" said Lloyd Blankfein, former chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N).

""While some banks have been hung up by poorly managed, concentrated risk, the overall banking system is extremely well capitalized and substantially more tightly regulated than in prior challenging times.”

The Swiss banking marriage follows efforts in Europe and the United States to support the sector since the collapse of U.S. lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.

Some investors welcomed the weekend steps but took a cautious stance.

""Provided markets don’t sniff out other lingering problems, I’d think this should be pretty positive,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments.

Problems remain in the U.S. banking sector, where bank stocks remained under pressure despite a move by several large banks to deposit $30 billion into First Republic Bank (FRC.N), an institution rocked by the failures of Silicon Valley and Signature Bank.

On Sunday, First Republic saw its credit ratings downgraded deeper into junk status by S&P Global, which said the deposit infusion may not solve its liquidity problems.

U.S. bank deposits have stabilized, with outflows slowing or stopping and in some cases reversing, a U.S. official said on Sunday, adding the problems of Credit Suisse are unrelated to recent deposit runs on U.S. banks and that U.S. banks have limited exposure to Credit Suisse.

The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC), meanwhile, is planning to relaunch the sale process for Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB.O), with the regulator seeking a potential breakup of the lender, according to people familiar with the matter.

'DECISIVE INTERVENTION'

The intervention comes after two sources told Reuters earlier on Sunday that major banks in Europe were looking to the Fed and ECB to step in with stronger signals of support to stem contagion.

The euro , the pound and the Australian dollar all rose by around 0.4% against the greenback, indicating a degree of risk appetite in markets.

""Bank stocks should rally on the news, but it is premature to signal all-clear,"" said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer for Angeles Investments in California.

UBS Chair Colm Kelleher said during a press conference that it will wind down Credit Suisse's investment bank, which has thousands of employees worldwide. UBS said it expected annual cost savings of some $7 billion by 2027.

The Swiss central bank said Sunday's deal includes 100 billion Swiss francs ($108 billion) in liquidity assistance for UBS and Credit Suisse.

Credit Suisse shareholders will receive 1 UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares held, equivalent to 0.76 Swiss francs per share for a total consideration of 3 billion francs, UBS said.

Credit Suisse shares had lost a quarter of their value last week. The bank was forced to tap $54 billion in central bank funding as it tries to recover from scandals that have undermined confidence.

Under the deal with UBS, some Credit Suisse bondholders are major losers. The Swiss regulator decided that Credit Suisse bonds with a notional value of $17 billion will be valued at zero, angering some of the holders of the debt who thought they would be better protected than shareholders in a rescue deal announced on Sunday.

ZURICH, March 25 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) tapped the Swiss National Bank for ""a large multi-billion amount"" last weekend to secure its liquidity, the country's finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter told Swiss broadcaster SRF on Saturday.

The troubled Swiss bank had said last week it intended to borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs from the country's central bank to boost its liquidity.

""Last weekend, a large multi-billion amount was withdrawn by Credit Suisse for liquidity protection,"" Keller-Sutter said.

She said this was because customers had again withdrawn money, but also because counterparties were demanding guarantees when they are doing business with the bank.

Keller-Sutter said ""it is to be assumed"" that the figure was above 50 billion Swiss francs ($54.35 billion), but said the Swiss National Bank had the exact number.

""The important thing is that the situation has stabilised,"" she said.

Last Sunday, UBS (UBSG.S) agreed to buy its rival Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) for 3 billion Swiss francs in stock and agreed to assume up to 5 billion francs in losses in a merger engineered by Swiss authorities to prevent more market turmoil in global banking.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse















ZURICH, March 22 (Reuters) - The fall of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) has dealt a serious blow to Switzerland's credentials as the world's leading wealth management centre, experts warn, calling into question its reputation for stability, regulation and corporate governance.

Battered by years of scandals and losses, Credit Suisse had been fighting a crisis of confidence for months, before its demise was sealed in just a matter of days last week when Swiss authorities brokered a takeover of the bank by larger rival UBS.

UBS itself needed to be rescued by the government in 2008 after a disastrous foray into U.S. mortgage securities.

The Credit Suisse collapse and its aftermath ""is going to be very damaging,"" said Arturo Bris, Professor of Finance at the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) in Lausanne, adding it could benefit rival financial centres.

Switzerland manages $2.6 trillion in international assets according to a 2021 Deloitte study, making it the world's largest financial centre ahead of Britain and the United States. But it faces competition from other centres including Luxembourg and in particular Singapore, which has grown rapidly in recent years.

""The bankers in Singapore are going to be uncorking the champagne bottles,"" Bris told Reuters.

Switzerland's credibility as a stable, predictable country had been upended by moves like the decision to wipe out the holdings of Credit Suisse bondholders, he said.

Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

While Credit Suisse's AT1 prospectus made clear that hybrid (AT1) holders would not recover any value, few anticipated the bank's demise.

The Swiss Bankers Association has attempted to put a brave face on the crisis, presenting the rescue engineered by the government, central bank and regulator as sign of strength.

""The Swiss financial sector was able to address a major issue of a significant player,"" SBA Chairman and former UBS CEO Marcel Rohner told reporters on Tuesday.

""In that sense I also see a prosperous future for the financial centre because we have hundreds of very well capitalised banks and very successful wealth management and asset management banks.""

Still, the number of banks has fallen, down to 239 in 2021 from 356 in 2002. Staff numbers since 2011 have slipped to 91,000 from 108,000.

Others were more skeptical about the future, highlighting a reluctance to confront mistakes at Credit Suisse or take responsibility for the aftermath.

""There are a lot of open questions: the use of emergency law overriding the views of shareholders or the treatment of bond holders,"" said Stefan Legge, head of tax and trade policy at the University of St. Gallen's IFF Institute for Financial Studies.

""Maybe some people are a bit delusional – and really believe they are doing a great job.""

Switzerland invoked emergency legislation to allow a public liquidity backstop (PLB) which will provide up to 100 billion Swiss francs in liquidity to Credit Suisse as the PLB was not yet part of Swiss law.

But perhaps most controversially, the emergency law allowed the takeover to go ahead without shareholder approval.

Legge said the collapse should serve as a wake-up call, and could see new laws to improve corporate governance introduced.

Switzerland has few mechanisms for holding top bankers individually responsible for mismanagement, unlike centres such as Britain where senior managers can face criminal sanctions.

Unions and politicians have also reacted angrily to the rescue, which could leave the taxpayer having to cover up to 9 billion francs in losses.

LONG DECLINE

Switzerland's outsized banking sector has been under pressure for years following a decline in banking secrecy as other countries sought to clamp down on tax evasion by citizens.

The financial sector's contribution to the Swiss economy has also slipped, falling to 8.9% of Swiss GDP in 2022 from 9.9% in 2002 as industries like pharmaceuticals became more important in a country with the third highest GDP per capita in the world, according to IMF data.

BAK Economics, a Swiss research institute, said the fallout from the debacle would be contained within the banking sector. It estimated up to 12,000 Swiss jobs being lost, although the impact on the broader economy would be limited.

Jan-Egbert Sturm director of the KOF Swiss Economic Institute at ETH Zurich, a university, predicted the economic impact of Credit Suisse's demise would amount to a loss of around 0.05% of GDP per year.

Switzerland's long banking tradition and structural advantages meant the country would remain heavily involved in banking in future, he said, with investors still choosing it for its stability and the strength of its Swiss franc currency.

Still competition was getting fiercer, and the recent events would eventually see Singapore overtake Switzerland, warned IMD's Bris.

[CC may contain inaccuracies] I was reading one analyst saying the 1, 2 and 3 things we're looking out for are deposits, deposits, deposits. Yeah, absolutely. That's that's the key thing, isn't it? But I mean, you know, going back to this 81 issue is still it's still so, so much of a kind of an uncertainty around how it's priced into the market. There's a couple of things that we're watching, the UniCredit, whether they exercise their call option, which is coming up in June. That's a pretty big kind of we'll be quite a big event and want to keep a close eye on. But of course, in this part of the world, in Japan and Sumitomo, Mitsui, and they're heading continuing with their marketing for their 81 bonds. A couple of perpetual bonds there. So so clearly the banks are wanting to still go ahead with plans that they had prior to all eruptions that we had a few a few weeks ago. But, you know, whether it gets priced, I think it's around April 19th, that one. So that's another key date to watch forces. A couple of events coming up. And I think then you start to get a sense of how investors pricing these. What's the kind of future looking like for this market, how a regulator is going to want or whether they're going to kind of be clamping down, giving quiet words into the ears of bank officials to say, you know, try and keep things as normal as you can get in this market. What are we expecting to see in terms of sort of what we can gauge from the broader economy? Well, of course, the big thing you, Shari, remains kind of the extent to which the the banking ructions and the issues with deposits, which largely is being caused by the huge increase in rates over a short space of time with a lot of fixed income instruments obviously having sold off significantly. So how much that is influencing people's expectations for not just a contraction in kind of credit growth, but but how that feeds into, you know, consumer spending, the broader economy. And of course, there are a lot of indications and a lot of what we've heard from from senior bank CEOs in recent weeks is that there's still, you know, the consumers still there is still a lot of indications to suggest, you know, a deep recession is not imminent. But of course, we had the Fed the other day saying that, yeah, maybe, maybe the forecast for a shallow recession is kind of like pretty baked in at this point. So I think that's what we're going to be looking for. Again, we're looking for any indications that what's happening in on the balance sheet of banks is feeding through to a more problematic outcome for the economy than people have been expecting when they started this year. Could we actually see a better picture when it comes to the big banks kind of seen as the safest custodians? They would have benefited from some of that deposit flight in that way. They may have done, Heidi. And that's that's the kind of one of the issues, isn't it? It's how much of, you know, when when a lot of these banks were standing behind some of the regional lenders that were having troubles are they're putting up these extra deposits when they were having discussions with the Yellin and senior Treasury officials that they were going to stand behind what was going on and have they in some way been able to benefit from that, or have they just kind of, in essence, spread the risk more broadly across the banking sector and stoked up further problems further down the line? So there will have been clearly some some beneficiaries out of that. And that will be one key thing to watch for.",[],2023-04-13 00:00:00

The SonntagsZeitung newspaper writes that various other investors are also examining how to appeal the controversial decision to wipe out the value of AT1 (Additional Tier One Capital) bonds during the emergency takeover by UBS last month.

+ all the latest updates on the credit suisse crisisexternal link

Law professor Thomas Werlen, who represents international legal firm Quinn Emanuel in Switzerland, told the paper that complaints may appeal to the terms of international investment protection treaties, which foresee reparations in the case of state expropriation.

Switzerland has signed over 100 such agreements with countries around the world.

Swiss financial regulator FINMA has maintained that it was contractually stipulated that the AT1 bonds would be written off in the case of a“viability” or emergency event –“in particular if extraordinary government support is granted”.

FINMA says that this“viability event” took place on Sunday, March 19, the day of the historic UBS deal.

But the SonntagsZeitung says questions remain about whether – and when exactly – Credit Suisse was actually insolvent, rather than illiquid, and thus entitled to wipe out the bonds.

The newspaper adds that the result of legal cases – should the Swiss state be found to have wrongly expropriated the bondholders – could be a bill of CHF8 billion, i.e. the market value of the AT1 bonds on March 17.

The write-down of the bonds, while Credit Suisse shareholders received payouts at the stock's takeover value, was a reversal of normal investor hierarchies and was subsequently questioned by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank.

Credit Suisse shareholders have suffered a loss of more than 70% this year, as the beleaguered bank has been hit by a series of crises that undermined the confidence of shareholders and customers alike.

And the failure of another major bank after the high-profile collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in the US has rippled through the wider financial sector, with Australian, UK and US banks nursing significant share price falls over the last month.

While the ASX has been rattled by the bank collapses overseas, predictably, the big four banks have fared worse than other ASX200 stocks, losing as much as 15% from previous highs earlier this year. The ASX is down by more than 8% for the comparable period.

Meanwhile, ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott published remarks on the ANZ Blue Notes website today that addressed concerns recent banking shocks could be the precursor to another global financial crisis.

“It’s like that old saying, you know, that history doesn’t repeat, but it rhymes. There are lots of rhymes here that we can see in previous turmoils or crises, including the GFC, but actually, when you really get the microscope out, the causes and what’s going on here are really, really different than the GFC,” Elliott says.

We’re going to take a closer look at what existing and potential investors need to know about Credit Suisse shares after the merger announcement and the potential ramifications for the Australian arm of the company.

However, he said it would be business as usual in the short-term.Sources told TOI that Cognizant , TCS and Wipro have deals with Credit Suisse amounting collectively to as much as $350-$400 million annually. The remaining slice of the outsourcing pie is shared between Infosys, Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech. “It’s good to assume there will be change. The way that regulators structured the deal (UBS taking over Credit Suisse), has brought in stability. All the existing work that's being done in countries - -technology, and operations all of that is continuing as business as usual. In two quarters, we will pitch to them (UBS) how they can leverage synergies. I don't know whether there will be an impact in the short term, but in the medium to long term, there will be an impact,” he said. He expects more business from the integration for tech players.Both Credit Suisse and UBS have a significant presence in India through their tech centres. As of December, UBS had 22% of its 74,000 employees in Asia Pacific, and India is a big part of its tech operations.TCS signed $10 billion total contract value in the March quarter, which is the highest quarterly TCV in the last financial year. Out of which $3 billion came from banking and financial services. “After the SVB collapse, customers became a bit tentative. What’s the noise out there? We want to do projects but let’s spend wisely. Our incremental revenue of over $1 billion which is the size of a startup or a small firm. If they don't do anything in six months given the pace at which technology changes, they will become a legacy company very quickly. So, they have deferred a few projects which have impacted our revenue,” he said. TCS’s revenue grew a modest 0.6% in constant currency in the quarter compared to the preceding one, outweighed by weak cues in banking and financial services.Subramaniam said banks are focusing on cost optimization by simplifying the organization and across the ecosystem in which they operate. “The whole approach is to kill reconciliation. In each bank, there are thousands of people doing reconciliation work in the back office. We don’t need them if you optimise using tech. With newer technologies like generative AI, there are opportunities to co-innovate and cocreate,” he added.In the 2023-24 financial year, large banks across North America, Europe or the UK seem to be pressing ahead with tech spending, but they seem to be watchful. “There are no cancellations, barring central Europe, where it's tentative. The Nordics are doing well. There are some green shoots emerging. We are navigating uncertainty with the right level of optics,” he added.Many deals are in the $50-100 million range. In the March quarter, TCS won a $700 million deal from UK's largest long-term savings and retirement provider Phoenix in the March quarter. “If we have one or two mega deals in a year, it's good. Large deals are susceptible to problems -- it takes 4-5 years to execute and management and tech changes will be there,” he added.Subramaniam said he doesn’t anticipate the chain reaction that was pronounced in the banking and financial services space during the recession. When asked about CEO designate K Krithivasan successor to take over BFSI sector, he said, “There are a lot of candidates and we’re not in a hurry.”Subramaniam said fresher additions of over 40,000 in the 2024 fiscal is intact, but lateral hiring is need-based. We have a strong bench and we have enough capacity. We have more than 2 lakh employees over ten years and above in TCS that we need to leverage,” he said.TCS , he said, would be rolling out 15-20% hikes for top performers, 10-15% for good performers and 5-7% for average performers. “We have rolled out hikes effective April 1 And gave 100% variable pay last quarter. It’s safe to assume average hikes will be in the range of 8-12%,” he said.",[],

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

The world watched in shock as Credit Suisse, one of the most established global banking and financial services institutions, collapsed and was eventually acquired by UBS. A significant factor in Credit Suisse's downfall was its rigid stance on forcing staff to return to the office. This cautionary tale serves as a reminder for business leaders to adapt to the changing world of work and prioritize their workforce's needs and preferences.

The iron fist: Credit Suisse's return to the office policy

In stark contrast to the growing trend of many companies embracing a flexible hybrid work approach, Credit Suisse took a more traditional approach, mandating that staff return to the office three days a week. According to one banker there, ""they're removing our flexibility, and it doesn't feel great.""

The bank's leadership failed to recognize the fundamental shift in employee expectations and the value of flexible work arrangements. Despite several studies and real-world examples pointing to the benefits of hybrid work, Credit Suisse's top brass remained stubbornly attached to outdated work paradigms.

By forcing staff to return to the office, Credit Suisse demonstrated a lack of empathy for its employees' wellbeing and work-life balance. This disregard for employee needs resulted in decreased morale, heightened stress and increased turnover rates. The bank lost talented individuals to competitors that embraced hybrid and remote work, which in turn weakened its competitive advantage.

Moreover, Credit Suisse's decision fueled resentment among its employees, who felt their preferences and needs were being disregarded. This led to a decline in engagement and commitment, ultimately impacting the bank's productivity and bottom line.

The repercussions of a stagnant culture

Credit Suisse's insistence on returning to the office reflects an outdated organizational culture, one that clings to traditional ways of working despite the evidence supporting the benefits of hybrid and remote work. By failing to adapt to the changing landscape of work, Credit Suisse missed out on opportunities to innovate, collaborate and remain competitive.

This stagnant culture ultimately played a significant role in the bank's collapse. Its inability to retain and attract top talent, coupled with the negative impact on employee morale and productivity, contributed to Credit Suisse's weakened position in the market.

As a result of its inability to adapt to the new normal and retain top talent, Credit Suisse's operations suffered. Its collapse had a ripple effect on the financial sector and served as a cautionary tale for other organizations. The bank's demise was a wake-up call for leaders worldwide, emphasizing the importance of embracing change and prioritizing employee wellbeing.

UBS's acquisition of Credit Suisse highlights the stark contrast between a company that understood the necessity of change and one that stubbornly clung to outdated practices. Consider that UBS adopted a much more flexible model of work arrangements, with some roles at the firm being 100% remote, while others are a flexible hybrid modality. This approach came from a UBS survey that found 86% of its employees stated they valued more flexibility, including the ability to maintain a remote or hybrid work arrangement. UBS said that as technology enhancements and the adoption of virtual work continue, it's ""finding new ways to engage with clients and build trusted relationships."" This is the kind of innovation that Credit Suisse was missing.

A lesson in adaptability: embracing hybrid work

The collapse of Credit Suisse highlights the importance of adaptability in the ever-evolving world of work. By forcing employees to return to the office, the bank ignored the benefits of hybrid work and the shifting preferences of its workforce. As a cutting-edge expert in the field of hybrid and remote work, I have seen firsthand the advantages of embracing these work arrangements. Over the past few years, hybrid and remote work has revolutionized the way organizations function, allowing them to tap into global talent pools, reduce operational costs and improve employee satisfaction. Companies that have successfully transitioned to hybrid or remote work have seen productivity gains and a better work-life balance for their employees.

To avoid a similar fate to Credit Suisse, business leaders must embrace the following principles:

Acknowledge the changing landscape: The world of work has undergone a seismic shift, with employees now expecting greater flexibility.

The collapse of SVB vs. UBS

For readers who may be skeptical that Credit Suisse's forced return to the office was a significant factor in the bank's collapse, it's worth noting the contrasting example of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which also collapsed. Many advocates of the return to office blamed SVB's more flexible remote work policy for its failure due to weaker communication and collaboration.

Well, what's good for the goose is good for the gander, right? If we blame SVB's failure on its flexible work policy, the same logic suggests that the forced return to office is to blame for the failure of Credit Suisse. That's especially the case considering the successful acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS, which has embraced a more flexible hybrid work model. That contrast further underscores the significance of adaptability and responsiveness to employee preferences in today's rapidly changing work environment. UBS has demonstrated a willingness to adapt and innovate, adopting remote and hybrid work arrangements to meet the diverse needs of its employees. This approach has allowed UBS to maintain a competitive edge and retain top talent.

In the end, work arrangements explain part of the collapse of both banks. We need to be realistic in acknowledging how work arrangements have an impact on performance and operations but cannot be blamed entirely. Still, it's an important part of the story that deserves to be told.

Conclusion

The collapse of Credit Suisse serves as a stark reminder of the importance of adaptability and responsiveness in today's business world. By embracing hybrid work and prioritizing employee wellbeing, organizations can avoid the pitfalls of stagnant culture and position themselves for success in the ever-changing landscape of work. Failure to adapt may not only lead to the loss of top talent and decreased productivity but can also result in more severe consequences, as seen with the demise of Credit Suisse.",['Gleb Tsipursky'],2023-03-23 19:00:00+00:00

GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland’s government said Tuesday that it’s ordering Credit Suisse to temporarily suspend bonuses for employees after orchestrating a plan for the No. 2 Swiss bank to be taken over by rival UBS .

The Swiss Department of Finance says federal law allows the government to set “remuneration-related measures” in cases involving Switzerland’s biggest banks.

Late last week and into the weekend, authorities in Switzerland, backed by the central bank and financial regulators, scrambled to cobble together a $3.25 billion sale of Credit Suisse to UBS.

An outflow of deposits and years of trouble raised fears that it could fail and trigger an international financial crisis after the collapse of two U.S. banks .

The Swiss government says it doesn’t plan to block bonus payments from last year that have been granted but are set to be immediately paid because it doesn’t want to penalize Credit Suisse employees “who did not cause the crisis.”

But authorities in the capital, Bern, said they will prohibit payouts of “deferred” bonuses — even though they have already been granted — with an exception for bonuses that “are already in the process of being paid out.”",['Jamey Keaten'],2023-03-21 18:20:49+00:00

GENEVA (AP) — Longtime troubles at Credit Suisse came to a head this week with a record stock plunge that spread fears of a banking crisis jumping from the U.S. to Europe . But the problems have been building for years at Switzerland’s second-largest bank, ranging from bad bets on hedge funds to a spying scandal involving rival lender UBS .

Experts say the upheaval is largely a byproduct of Credit Suisse’s troubles in recent years — making it look relatively vulnerable — and investor worries about the health of Western banks in general following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the United States.

Shares of Credit Suisse sank over 30% Wednesday after its biggest shareholder — the Saudi National Bank — announced it would not provide more money to the Swiss lender. Hours later, Switzerland’s central bank agreed to lend Credit Suisse up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) to shore up its finances. The stock rebounded .

On Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.

Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist, said Credit Suisse has become “an important bellwether of fragilities in the global banking system” and if it failed, it could dampen confidence in the banking system and spur further central bank intervention.

“The Swiss National Bank has in effect pulled Credit Suisse back from the cliff’s edge and is likely to have done enough to stabilize the situation with the massive liquidity infusion,” said Prasad, who studies the global financial system. “The wild card is whether steps taken so far by the Federal Reserve and Swiss National Bank will contain the conflagration or if it spreads further, which could engender significant additional turmoil.”

The Saudi bank’s chairman acknowledged surprise at the fallout from his comments but said he was “optimistic” that Credit Suisse would “go back to being what it is” — a bank with a storied legacy dating back more than a century and a half.

“I think the markets are very skittish , and they are looking for stories or things that validate concern,” Saudi National Bank Chairman Ammar al-Khudairy told CNBC on Thursday.

He called Credit Suisse’s private wealth management, domestic Swiss banking and asset management divisions “stable, long-term consistent businesses” and that the Swiss bank was “working on shedding the other, more-volatile business.”

In the wake of reforms enacted after the 2008 financial crisis, Credit Suisse is among the 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, which have stricter scrutiny and higher capital requirements.

Credit Suisse was founded as “Schweizerische Kreditanstalt” in 1856 by industrialist Alfred Escher to finance the development of Switzerland’s complex rail network cutting through the Alps.

At the time, it was a high-risk, loss-making industry. Historians say a penchant for risk and innovation permeates through the corporate culture even today.

By 1977, Credit Suisse was at the center of a banking scandal known as the “Chiasso Affair,” which led the bank to lose nearly 1.4 billion francs in illegal dealings by a branch in Italian-speaking Switzerland with fugitive funds from Italy.

The “internationalization” of Credit Suisse — focusing more on the United States and adopting an “Anglo-Saxon” culture — led to “identity problems” starting in the 1980s, when it began rising from a midsized European bank into a global player, Tobias Straumann, an economic historian at the University of Zurich, said in the Neue Zuericher Zeitung newspaper Friday.

“(Swiss bankers) simply couldn’t cope with this American investment bank culture, with its focus on risk and high profits,” he said. “The combination of Anglo-Saxon investment banking and Swiss asset management did not work in the long run.”

The “end of banking secrecy” in Switzerland — which long helped guarantee large financial reserves for Credit Suisse — in recent years has had an important effect by denting its wealth management business, he added.

Other Western countries pressured Switzerland to tighten its laws to prevent wealthy tax cheats and others from hiding their money in Swiss banks.

More recently, the issues at Credit Suisse have been mostly about poor corporate governance, questionable staffing decisions and excessively risky investments.

In 2020, CEO Tidjane Thiam resigned after an external investigation found the bank’s chief operating officer had ordered an operation to spy on several former executives, including former wealth management chief Iqbal Khan, who had joined Zurich rival UBS.

Two years later, his replacement — longtime Credit Suisse veteran Thomas Gottstein — resigned after the bank posted a quarterly loss of 1.6 billion francs.

Credit Suisse even found itself in Swiss court, getting fined last June for failing to prevent money laundering by a Bulgarian crime ring 15 years earlier. The case partly involved an unidentified wrestler accused of trafficking tons of cocaine through “mules” from South America to Europe and laundering the profits.

ADVERTISEMENT

The bank last fall announced settlements worth hundreds of millions of dollars with authorities in the U.S. over mortgage-backed securities that were behind the 2008 financial crisis and in France over a tax fraud case .

Credit Suisse is “in trouble because it’s been in trouble for a really long time. It has a whole host of other challenges that everyone’s focusing on now because of bank wobbles in the U.S.,” said Megan Greene, chief economist at the Kroll Institute.

That’s different than Silicon Valley Bank, which was hit by rising interest rates. The Swiss lender is “full of high-quality assets” but faced a liquidity crisis, and the “playbook” for dealing with that is central bank intervention, she said.

“This is not 2008 all over again,” Greene said. “But the overreactions that we’ve seen in the market have been eerily reminiscent of 2008. That has gotten everybody’s Spidey-sense tingling.”

She said she was worried, “but rationally speaking, there isn’t a reason to think that a banking crisis is inevitable. It’s just that markets aren’t always rational.”

“Personally I have come to the conclusion…that a globally active systemically important bank cannot simply be wound up according to the ‘too big to fail’ plan,” Karin Keller-Sutter told Zurich newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) in an interview published Saturday. “Legally this would be possible. In practice, however, the economic damage would be considerable.”

Citing expert estimates, she said the impact of a disorderly bankruptcy could have been as much as double Swiss economic output.

Keller-Sutter sat at the center of emergency negotiations last weekend, when Swiss authorities mulled nationalizing Credit Suisse after the bank rejected a takeover offer from UBS for about $1 billion

UBS eventually agreed to pay more than $3 billion for Credit Suisse in a government-brokered deal, helping to contain a crisis of confidence with global ramifications. Not that everyone was pleased: About $17 billion of risky Credit Suisse AT1 bonds suddenly became worthless.

“This was the only possible solution,” she said Sunday, describing the deal as necessary to stabilize the Swiss and international financial markets. But as she told NZZ, last weekend “was clearly not the moment for experiments. The crash of Credit Suisse would have dragged other banks into the abyss.”

An orderly wind down would have caused “considerable” damage to Switzerland, which risked becoming “the first country to wind down a globally systemically important bank,” she told NZZ in her first interview since the crisis. (Bloomberg and the Financial Times reported on the interview earlier on Saturday.)

Credit Suisse would not have survived another day of trading, she told NZZ. Swiss authorities had raced to finish a deal before markets opened in Asia on Monday. “Without a solution, payment transactions with CS in Switzerland would have been significantly disrupted, possibly even collapsed,” she noted.

And, she added, “it was clear to everyone—including ourselves—that a restructuring or liquidation of CS would trigger major international upheaval in the financial markets.”

But she dismissed the idea that the U.S. pressured Switzerland into the deal, saying: “It wasn’t as if the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Janet Yellen, said to me on the phone: You have to make sure that UBS buys CS.”",['Steve Mollman'],2023-03-25 00:00:00

LONDON, March 23 (Reuters) - The Swiss authorities and UBS Group AG are racing to close the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG within as little as a month, according to two sources with knowledge of the plans, to try to retain the lender's clients and employees.

But combining Credit Suisse into UBS could take much longer, potentially months, because the deal needs approval from regulators in tens of countries, the people said, seeking anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter.

Spokespeople for UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment.

""This is absolutely necessary and we got all the commitments from both parties that they will do everything for this takeover to be successful.""

Asked for more precise details on when the deal could close at the same media conference, the vice chairman declined to comment.

""We are waiting for final regulatory approvals across the globe so we will complete this deal as quickly as we can,"" UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said on Sunday. ""It will be weeks, short months to get this deal effectively closed.""

The longer the deal takes to close, the harder it will be for Credit Suisse to hold on to its business as the uncertainty erodes confidence in the lender.

Bank of America's electronic stocks desk had halted trading with a desk at Credit Suisse that uses computer-led strategies, an email seen by Reuters on Monday said.

Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that Wall Street banks and European firms are lifting hiring freezes to lure staff from Credit Suisse.

ZURICH, March 21 (Reuters) - Days before a hastily convened press conference late on Sunday that would make the world's front pages, Switzerland's political elite were secretly preparing a move that would jolt the globe.

While the nation's central bank and financial regulator publicly declared that Credit Suisse was sound, behind closed doors the race was on to rescue the nation's second-biggest bank.

The chain of events, led to the erasure of one of Switzerland's flagships, a merger backed by 260 billion Swiss francs ($280 billion) of state funds and a move that would upend global finance: favoring the bank's shareholders to the detriment of bond investors.

The events that unfolded in the landlocked nation -- long a bastion of political neutrality that has secured its standing as a safe-haven favourite for wealthy elites -- go against one of the key lessons of the 2008 financial crisis. The rescue concentrates even greater risks into one banking behemoth, UBS Group AG.

What is more, making bondholders cushion the blow to stock investors from the UBS-Credit Suisse tie-up rattled lenders, pushing up their borrowing costs in a threat to world economic growth.

The Swiss National Bank declined to comment while the finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

Battered by years of scandals and losses, Credit Suisse for months had been battling a crisis of confidence of its own making. In a matter of days its demise was sealed.

Soon after news broke on March 12 that the United States would step in to guarantee all the deposits of two mid-sized lenders struggling to keep up with demands for cash, the spotlight was on Credit Suisse and how it would maintain depositor confidence.

Customers had already pulled $110 billion from the Zurich-based bank in the last three months of 2022, outflows that it was fighting to reverse.

A rainmaker who brokered a number of European bank rescues during the financial crisis, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that after seeing the U.S. banking collapses there was little doubt UBS would be called upon to shore up Credit Suisse.

The banker on March 13 rang up UBS warning the world's biggest wealth manager that it should prepare to receive a call from Swiss authorities.

By Wednesday, two days later, Credit Suisse was swept up in a full-blown crisis. Comments by the chair of Saudi National Bank, Ammar Al Khudairy, who said that he could not invest further in the Swiss bank sent Credit Suisse shares into a tailspin.

It mattered little that Credit Suisse's biggest investor also reiterated confidence in the lender. ""They're a globally systemically important bank so ... monitored on a daily basis,"" he told Reuters. ""There's no surprises like you would have in a middle-sized bank in the US. It's a completely different ecosystem.""

Significant deposit outflows followed, the source who would go on to advise UBS on the merger told Reuters, declining to put a number on them.

In banking center Zurich and Bern, the Alpine state's capital, pressure was building. Yet as the discussions to salvage Credit Suisse got underway, Swiss regulators FINMA and the Swiss National Bank said that ""the problems of certain banks in the USA do not pose a direct risk of contagion for the Swiss financial markets"", conceding, however, that they would fund the bank with unlimited access to funding.

Credit Suisse too was conveying stability. The bank told Reuters on Thursday that its average liquidity coverage ratio, a key measure of how much cash-like assets the bank has, did not change between March 8 and March 14, despite the global banking crisis.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter, a former translator and teacher just months on the job, told the Sunday media conference that additional support for Credit Suisse had been agreed but held secret for fear of panicking people with a succession of emergency announcements.

She said was in close contact with U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and British finance minister Jeremy Hunt. Both countries have large Credit Suisse subsidiaries employing thousands.

There was far less communication with the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, said one person familiar with the matter. Credit Suisse's arms in Luxembourg, Spain and Germany were far smaller.

European regulators were, in particular, worried that the Swiss could impose losses on bondholders - a radical step that they did take, as the costs of a rescue spiralled for taxpayers.

""They did this on their own,"" said the person, asking not to be named, describing the outcome as a ""big surprise"".

A spokesperson for FINMA said that although it laid emphasis on Britain and the U.S. because of the scale of Credit Suisse's business in those countries, it had also informed European authorities.

Not everyone, however, was kept in the dark.

Saudi investors, with roughly a 10% stake in the bank, put pressure on the Swiss, warning that they could take legal action if they did not recover some of their ill-fated investment, said another person with knowledge of the matter.

Saudi National Bank did not immediately respond to a request for a comment

""The money had to come from somewhere,"" said one of the officials involved in the negotiations.

The Credit Suisse board, interested in preserving some unity in an increasingly fractious setting, stood behind them, and argued for a payout to shareholders, said the person.

Regulators too wanted to avoid a wipeout for shareholders that would have resulted in the winding up of the bank, potentially a bigger headache for the nation and a loss of face just hours after standing by Credit Suisse.

In the end, the Swiss agreed, choosing to wipe out 16 billion of francs of bonds, compensating shareholders with 3 billion francs and turning a key principle of bank funding on its head - namely, that shareholders rather than bondholders take the first hit from a bank failure.

It marks an ignominious end for an institution founded by Alfred Escher, a Swiss magnate affectionately dubbed King Alfred I, who helped build the country's railways. Credit Suisse banks many Swiss companies and citizens - including finance minister Keller-Sutter.

On Sunday, as a panel of Swiss officials and executives announced the deal, they were unrepentant.

""This is no bailout,"" Keller-Sutter told journalists. Thomas Jordan, the central bank chief, defended the package, as necessary to counter any wider shock.

""The taxpayer in this scenario has less risk,"" said Keller-Sutter. ""The bankruptcy would have been the highest risk because the cost to the Swiss economy would have been huge.""

Still, markets are reeling from the extraordinary turn of events.

""When you are a bank for billionaires, deposits can fly away very quickly,"" said one of the people involved. ""You can die in three days.""

The terms of the deal will see Credit Suisse shareholders receive 1 UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares they hold.

""This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue.

""We are committed to making this deal a great success. There are no options in this,"" Kelleher said when asked during the press conference if the bank could back out of the deal. ""This is absolutely essential to the financial structure of Switzerland and ... to global finance.""

The Swiss National Bank pledged a loan of up to 100 billion Swiss francs ($108 billion) to support the takeover.

March 20 (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. lender First Republic tumbled nearly 50% on Monday on fears it will need a second rescue to stay afloat, bucking a broader rally in bank shares driven by UBS Group's state-backed takeover of Credit Suisse.

Less than a week after large U.S. banks pumped $30 billion in deposits into the midsized U.S. lender, investors dumped First Republic on worries that infusion of capital would not be enough. Ratings agency S&P Global also downgraded it deeper into junk status on Sunday, citing liquidity risks.

JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) CEO Jamie Dimon is leading talks with other big banks on new efforts to stabilize First Republic with a possible investment into the lender, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

JPMorgan and First Republic declined to comment on the report. A spokesperson for First Republic pointed to an earlier statement where the bank said it was ""well-positioned to manage short-term deposit activity"".

The tumult at First Republic, whose shares ended down 47.1%, overshadowed an otherwise positive day for banking stocks globally, led by relief that UBS Group AG's (UBSG.S) takeover of 167-year-old Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S) would avert a wider banking crisis.

""There (is) more good news than bad news on the banking front,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. ""First and foremost, the Credit Suisse, UBS merger certainly takes a lot of stress out of the global banking system.""

The 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.2 billion) deal for the troubled Swiss bank - which was once worth more than $90 billion - was engineered by Swiss regulators and announced on Sunday.

European bank shares (.SX7P) rebounded from recent losses, while on Wall Street the S&P 500 banks (.SPXBK) index recovered 0.6%.

Regional U.S. lenders also rose. PacWest Bancorp (PACW.O) jumped almost 11% after saying deposit outflows had stabilized and its available cash exceeded total uninsured deposits.

Market cap of US regional banks included in the S&P 500 regional bank index

Bonds issued by major European banks fell after some Credit Suisse bondholders were wiped out in the deal. But UBS shares closed up 1.3%, bouncing from a 16% slump triggered by concerns about the long-term benefits of the deal and the outlook for Switzerland, once considered a paragon of sound banking.

A deal on Sunday for a unit of New York Community Bancorp (NYCB.N) to buy deposits and loans from the failed Signature Bank (SBNY.O) also boosted sentiment in U.S. banks. New York Community Bancorp shares surged 32%.

The turmoil that gripped banks over the past week was triggered by the collapse of U.S. midsized lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, quickly ensnaring Credit Suisse as investors fretted about other ticking bombs in the banking system.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has decided to break up Silicon Valley Bank and hold two separate auctions for its traditional deposits unit and its private bank after failing to find a buyer for the failed lender last week.

With worries around Credit Suisse easing, attention is now turning to the U.S. Federal Reserve, whose relentless rate hikes to quash inflation were seen as a trigger for the turmoil.

Traders have now increased their bets that the central bank will pause its hiking cycle on Wednesday to try to ensure financial stability, but on the whole remain split over whether the Fed will raise its benchmark policy rate.

COORDINATED ACTION

Policymakers from Washington to Europe have repeatedly stressed that the current turmoil is different from the global financial crisis 15 years ago, pointing to banks being better capitalised and funds more easily available.

Still, top central banks promised at the weekend to provide dollar liquidity to stabilise the financial system to prevent the banking jitters from snowballing into a bigger crisis.

In a global response not seen since the height of the pandemic, the Fed said it had joined central banks in Canada, Britain, Japan, the euro zone and Switzerland in a co-ordinated action to enhance market liquidity.

Investor focus in Europe shifted to the massive blow some Credit Suisse bondholders will take, prompting euro zone and UK banking supervisors to try to stop a rout in the market for convertible bank bonds.

The regulators said owners of this type of debt would only suffer losses after shareholders have been wiped out - unlike at Credit Suisse, whose main regulators are in Switzerland.

The eleventh-hour Swiss rescue is backed by a massive government guarantee, helping prevent what would have been one of the largest banking collapses since the fall of Lehman Brothers in 2008.

However, the Swiss regulator decided Credit Suisse's additional tier-1 (AT1) bonds with a notional value of $17 billion will be valued at zero, angering some holders of the debt who thought they would be better protected than shareholders.

AT1 bonds - a $275 billion sector also known as ""contingent convertibles"" or ""CoCo"" bonds - can be converted into equity or written off if a bank’s capital level falls below a certain threshold.

The deal will make UBS Switzerland’s only global bank. It will also make the Swiss economy more dependent on a single lender.

S&P said its outlook on UBS was revised to negative over execution risk but affirmed its ratings.

Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics

Switzerland's two biggest political parties sharply criticised the takeover, saying huge state support - which could add up to $280 billion - created enormous risks for the country.

""What has happened is terrible for the credibility of Switzerland,"" said Roger Nordmann, leader of the Social Democrats in the Swiss parliament.

""It's a warning shot for Switzerland about having banks which are just too big.""

Swiss parliamentarians voted this week against the state’s financial role in the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse, which the government orchestrated last month using emergency powers. Some lawyers and politicians are now wondering if the decision should be binding.

This content was published on April 16, 2023 minutes

Other language: 1 ( en original) Español (es) El voto ""simbólico"" del Parlamento sobre Credit Suisse

The legal wrangle centres around the government’s hasty consultation of a six-member parliamentary finance delegation to approve the emergency deal on March 19, which led to the fusion of Switzerland’s two biggest banks.

The finance ministry has maintained that emergency law allows for such bypassing of full parliamentary approval.

When the House of Representatives voted against the deal earlier this week, it was thus widely interpreted as a symbolic slap on the wrist for government, without any concrete consequences – including by parliamentarians themselves.

However, media have now been trying to figure out if the parliamentary “no” could have an impact. On Thursday, Zurich public law professor Andreas Kley told the 20 Minuten newspaper that following the vote, the government is no longer legally authorised to sign a CHF9 billion [guarantee] contract with UBS. On Sunday, the SonntagsBlick quoted (among others) Fribourg professor Andreas Stöckli, who agreed that the parliamentary decision was legally binding.

In question is a 2010 law – drafted in the wake of the emergency UBS bailout in 2008 – stipulating that urgent state credit needs not only the approval of the finance delegation, but also the “subsequent approval” of parliament as a whole.

Legal fine-print

The government has been sticking to its line: in Washington on Friday, Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said again that the parliamentary decision would have “no consequence”.

Politicians are however calling for a clarifications. Thomas Aeschi of the People’s Party (Switzerland’s biggest), told SRF public radio on Saturday that the parliament should have the last word, especially on the CHF9 billion for UBS, since it is part of a contract not yet finalised.

Members of the People’s Party, the Social Democrats and the Greens – the three groups who voted “no” earlier this week – plan to raise the issue in parliamentary committees this week to clear up the legal confusion, SRF says.

https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-03-20/ubs-got-credit-suisse-for-almost-nothing,UBS Got Credit Suisse for Almost Nothing,"It is sometimes useful to think that the shareholders of a bank are not its owners; they are just renting it from its creditors. Schematically, a bank borrows a bunch of money from depositors and other creditors and uses the money to make loans and buy securities and do other risky investments. If the investments end up being worth more than the deposits, the shareholders keep what’s left. If the investments end up being worth less than the deposits then, uh, that’s bad. Then the shareholders don’t own the bank anymore, for one thing, but that’s really the least of your problems. The real problem is that the depositors can’t lose money; the banking system relies on bank deposits being usable as money. “Banks are speculative investment funds grafted on top of critical infrastructure,” Matt Klein wrote last week. The liabilities (deposits, etc.) are the critical infrastructure; the assets (loans, securities) are the speculative investment fund. The bank is a machine for turning safe deposits into risky investments. If the investments end up being worth less than the deposits, then regulators and central banks step in and there is some sort of rushed rescue to make sure that the depositors still get paid.

One important consequence of this is that the equity of the bank — the shareholders’ ownership stake — is just a tiny sliver resting on top of an enormous iceberg of liabilities. In a good profitable conservative bank, there might be $100 of assets, $90 of liabilities and thus $10 of equity. The liabilities are certain and knowable, things like deposits that really need to be paid back at 100 cents on the dollar. The assets are risky and variable, and their valuation is a bit of a guess: They include securities with volatile market prices, weird derivatives that are hard to value, and business loans with uncertain probabilities of being paid back. The bank applies some accounting conventions and makes some guesses and comes up with a value of $100 for its assets, but there is a range of uncertainty around that number.","['Matt Levine', 'Follow The Authors']",2023-03-20 00:00:00

UBS Group AG has struck a deal to buy Credit Suisse—a rival Swiss bank rocked by financial turmoil—for over $3 billion, the two banks announced Sunday, as bank executives and Swiss officials sprint to contain a crisis sparked in part by the collapse of two major U.S. banks last week.

Key Facts

UBS ultimately agreed to pay $3.2 billion (or 3 billion Swiss Francs) in an all-share deal, with Credit Suisse investors receiving one UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares held, up from a $1 billion initial offer that Credit Suisse reportedly viewed as too low. The deal represents a large discount compared to Credit Suisse’s market capitalization just two days ago: UBS says the acquisition will cost the equivalent of $0.82 (or 0.76 Swiss Francs) per share, less than half Credit Suisse’s $2.01 share price when markets closed Friday. The combined company will have over $5 trillion in total invested assets, and UBS expects to make $8 billion in cost cuts over the next four years, UBS said in a statement late Sunday. The Swiss government helped broker the deal, with an apparent goal of completing the merger before Asian markets open Monday morning. As part of the agreement, the Swiss National Bank—the country’s central bank—offered Credit Suisse and UBS up to $108 billion in liquidity assistance loans, it said in a statement. The Swiss government is also expected to speed the deal up by waiving the six-week waiting period normally required before a merger, according to the New York Times, and Swiss authorities are not requiring UBS to get shareholder approval.

Crucial Quote

“With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,” the Swiss National Bank said.

Big Number

$54 billion. That’s how much Credit Suisse borrowed from the Swiss National Bank on Thursday. The central bank offered to provide liquidity to Credit Suisse “if necessary” hours earlier, but the bank’s share price still slid almost 7% the following day.

Key Background

Shares of Credit Suisse have plummeted in recent weeks, and trading was halted Wednesday after the share price fell up to 21%. On Tuesday, the bank said it had found “material weaknesses” in its 2021 and 2022 financial reporting processes. In response, its biggest backer, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn’t buy any more shares in Credit Suisse. The recent collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S., triggered partially by rising interest rates, caused uncertainty about wider vulnerabilities in the banking system worldwide—concerns that intensified after warning signs appeared at Credit Suisse. But the bank’s downfall wasn’t directly caused by SVB and Signature, and its problems predate the current crisis, as it ended the 2022 fiscal year with a loss of nearly $8 billion. The bank itself and some executives and advisors have also recently been linked to scandals, including alleged fraud and failing to prevent money laundering.

Multinational investment bank UBS has reportedly asked the Swiss government to cover about $6bn in costs if it was to buy rival Credit Suisse.

Authorities are scrambling to resolve a crisis of confidence in the 167-year-old Switzerland-based organisation, the most globally significant bank caught in the turmoil spurred by the collapse of US lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank over the past weeks.

Here is what you need to know about the potential takeover:

What is the latest with the negotiations?

The guarantees UBS is seeking would cover the cost of winding down parts of Credit Suisse and potential litigation charges.

UBS, which is also based in Switzerland, was reportedly under pressure from the Swiss authorities to take over its local rival to get the crisis under control. The plan could see Credit Suisse’s Swiss business spun off.

One source, according to Reuters news agency, has cautioned that the talks are encountering significant obstacles, and 10,000 jobs may have to be cut if the two banks merge.

Switzerland is preparing to use emergency measures to fast-track the deal, the Financial Times reported.

US authorities are working with their Swiss counterparts to help broker a deal, Bloomberg News reported.

According to Swiss newspaper Blick, UBS will buy Credit Suisse in a deal to be sealed on Sunday during an exceptional meeting in Bern, bringing together the Swiss government and the banks’ executives.

There were multiple reports of interest in Credit Suisse from other rivals as well. Bloomberg reported that Deutsche Bank was considering buying some of its assets.

Why is Credit Suisse in crisis?

Credit Suisse shares lost a quarter of their value in the last week.

The bank was forced to tap $54bn in central bank funding as it tries to recover from a string of scandals that undermined the confidence of investors and clients.

Credit Suisse has been plagued by a series of scandals in recent years. Shares were worth 12.78 Swiss francs ($13.84) in February 2021.

In 2022, the bank suffered a net loss of $7.9bn and expects a “substantial” pre-tax loss this year.

Tokyo, April 14 (Jiji Press)--Clients of Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. have bought about 95 billion yen's worth of bonds issued by Swiss financial giant Credit Suisse that are now worthless, people familiar with the matter said Friday.

The Additional Tier 1, or AT1, bonds were bought by about 1,500 client accounts, a majority of which belong to wealthy individuals, the people said.

Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley is currently explaining to clients how the value of the bonds was wiped out following Credit Suisse's financial troubles, the people said. ""We will continue to provide detailed explanations,"" a company official said.

The Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. <8306> unit sold the AT1 bonds between 2017 and last month. The company sold the bonds, which have large face values and relatively high yields, as part of an effort to expand services for wealthy clients.

The company explained the risks of the bonds at the time of selling.

Credit Suisse is not out of the woods just yet.

Shares in the Swiss lender fell by as much as 12% Friday, erasing most of Thursday’s gains, as investors feared that a $54 billion lifeline from the Swiss central bank might not be enough to rescue the beleaguered bank.

By comparison, Europe’s benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index, which tracks 42 big EU and UK lenders, fell by a more modest 3% by mid-afternoon.

Stefan Legge, an economics lecturer at the Swiss-based University of St. Gallen, told CNN that Credit Suisse’s problems ran particularly deep because of multiple hits to its reputation.

“A bank, more than any other business, requires trust from its customers, and that trust, that reputation, has been damaged time and time again,” Legge said. “There’s a point when it breaks.”

Credit Suisse has lost a third of its stock market value since the start of the year, and nearly 75% in the past 12 months, following a string of scandals and bad calls by management that have eroded investors’ confidence.

Customers have voted with their feet, withdrawing 123 billion Swiss francs ($133 billion) from Credit Suisse in 2022, mostly in the fourth quarter. Last month, the bank reported an annual net loss of nearly 7.3 billion Swiss francs ($7.9 billion), its biggest since the global financial crisis in 2008.

Investors have also been ditching Credit Suisse’s funds this week. European and US funds managed by the bank reported more than $450 million in net outflows between Monday and Wednesday, according to Morningstar Direct data on open-end and exchange-traded funds.

The bank’s stock has fallen particularly sharply since Monday, after the collapse of US lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank set alarm bells ringing about banks in other markets.

On Wednesday, Credit Suisse shares crashed as much as 30% to hit $1.55 apiece, a new record low.

The stock rebounded 19% Thursday following the bank’s announcement that it would borrow 50 billion Swiss francs ($53.7 billion) from the Swiss central bank “to pre-emptively strengthen its liquidity.”

What now?

According to JP Morgan’s banking analysts, the bumper liquidity injection from the Swiss National Bank is not enough to keep the bank afloat. In a note on Thursday, they wrote that they saw a takeover by fellow Swiss lender UBS as the most likely endgame.

Under this scenario, UBS would likely spin off Credit Suisse’s Swiss business since the two banks’ combined market share would make up about 30% of Switzerland’s domestic banking market and mean “too much concentration risk and market share control.”

There are two other paths Credit Suisse could take, the analysts wrote, though they are less likely.

Firstly, the bank could shutter its investment bank division and raise equity through a partial IPO of its domestic business.

Secondly, the Swiss National Bank could fully guarantee all deposits for Credit Suisse’s customers, or buy a portion of its stock. Both options would give the bank enough time to restructure, according to the analysts, but would likely be unpopular as they would require taxpayer funds.

Credit Suisse could also consider offering more shares to existing shareholders, according to Johann Scholtz, equity analyst at Morningstar. Although the move would dilute the value of its stock, it would raise vital capital, he wrote in a note Friday.

“Credit Suisse’s liquidity position seems adequate to handle deposit outflows, and it should also be able to obtain emergency liquidity from the Swiss National Bank,” he said.

“This does, however, not solve Credit Suisse’s profitability challenge, nor does it address capital concerns.”

Credit Suisse will be holding meetings over the weekend to assess scenarios for the bank, Reuters reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

Fears over the bank’s future have also hit its debt. One of the lender’s bonds, which matures next month, fell 3% Friday, to trade at 92% of face value.

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/02/switzerlands-attorney-general-to-investigate-credit-suisse-takeover,Switzerland’s attorney general to investigate Credit Suisse takeover,"Switzerland’s federal prosecutor has launched an investigation into whether last month’s state-backed takeover of the stricken bank Credit Suisse by its bigger rival UBS broke Swiss criminal law.

The office of the attorney general said it was looking into potential breaches by government officials, regulators and executives at the two banks who thrashed out an emergency merger over a frantic weekend in mid-March to prevent a wider financial meltdown.

“In light of recent events, the federal prosecutor’s office wants to proactively fulfil its mission and responsibility to contribute to a clean Swiss financial centre, and has set up monitoring in order to take immediate action in any situation that falls within its area,” the Berne-based prosecutor said.

It wants to analyse the “numerous aspects of events around Credit Suisse” – including those reported in the media – to “identify and assess any crimes that could fall within the competence of the prosecutor”.

The office, led by the attorney general of Switzerland, Stefan Blättler, has been in contact with national and regional authorities and has issued a number of “investigatory orders” to gather information. Blättler’s office is expected to interview key officials about the takeover, but declined to comment further.

After growing concerns about the future of Credit Suisse, one of the 30 banks in the world deemed too big to fail, the Swiss government and the banking regulator forced through the takeover of the bank by UBS for almost $3.25bn (£2.6bn), well below its market value.

They stepped in after it became clear that a 50bn Swiss franc (£44bn) loan to Credit Suisse from the Swiss central bank had failed to halt the dramatic slide in its share price.

UBS, which has brought back its former boss Sergio Ermotti to oversee the takeover, wants to cut its workforce by as much as 30% after completing the deal, putting up to 36,000 jobs at risk, according to a report in Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung.

Ermotti takes the helm on Tuesday, the same day Credit Suisse is holding its annual meeting of shareholders in Zürich, where it is expected to face intense questioning by investors, as will UBS at its annual meeting in Basel the following day.

US investors in Credit Suisse have launched legal action, claiming that it overstated its prospects before its share crash. In the takeover, Credit Suisse’s AT1 bondholders, who held about $17bn of risky debt, were wiped out.

The merger, which will create a banking giant worth more than 5tn Swiss francs, has caused a public outcry and is opposed by three-quarters of Swiss citizens.

There is likely to be a heated debate when the Swiss parliament holds a special session between 11 and 13 April to discuss the takeover. The government has also agreed to absorb up to 9bn Swiss francs of potential UBS losses.

In total, state and central bank support for the merged entity adds up to 260bn Swiss francs – a third of Switzerland’s annual economic output.

Lawmakers will also discuss whether there should be a parliamentary commission of inquiry to determine who should be held responsible for the collapse of the country’s second largest bank.

Before its rescue, Credit Suisse had been embroiled in a series of scandals, compliance problems and bad financial bets. In 2014, it pleaded guilty to allowing US clients to evade their taxes, leading to a $2.6bn fine from the US government and New York financial regulators.

On Friday, the US Senate committee concluded after a two-year investigation that Credit Suisse had violated its 2014 plea agreement with the US government and concealed more than $700m from tax authorities, and said the Swiss bank continued to help ultra-wealthy Americans dodge taxes.

In 2020, Credit Suisse’s then chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, resigned after two corporate espionage scandals involving senior employees, while the bank also lost $5.5bn on the collapse of US hedge fund Archegos Capital a year later.

The storm of negative publicity worsened last year after a consortium of outlets including the Guardian published revelations based on a leak showing that fraudsters, criminals and corrupt politicians had stored £80bn with the Zürich-based lender.

Customers began withdrawing billions of pounds from the bank last year in response to rumours about its financial health, leading to the bank’s worst full-year loss since the 2008 banking crisis.",['Julia Kollewe'],2023-04-02 00:00:00

GENEVA (AP) — Fears about the world banking system spread to Europe on Wednesday as shares in the globally connected Swiss bank Credit Suisse plunged and dragged down other major European lenders in the wake of bank failures in the United States .

At one point, Credit Suisse shares lost more than a quarter of their value, hitting a record low after the bank’s biggest shareholder — the Saudi National Bank — told news outlets that it would not put more money into the Swiss lender, which was beset by problems long before the U.S. banks collapsed .

The turmoil prompted an automatic pause in trading of Credit Suisse shares on the Swiss market and sent shares of other European banks tumbling, some by double digits. That fanned new fears about the health of financial institutions following the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S.

Speaking Wednesday at a financial conference in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann defended the bank, saying, “We already took the medicine” to reduce risks.

When asked if he would rule out government assistance in the future, he said: “That’s not a topic. ... We are regulated. We have strong capital ratios, very strong balance sheet. We are all hands on deck, so that’s not a topic whatsoever.”

But Switzerland’s central bank announced late Wednesday that it was prepared to act, saying it would support Credit Suisse if needed. A statement from the bank did not specify whether the support would come in the form of cash or loans or other assistance. At the moment, regulators said, they believe the bank has enough money to meet its obligations.

Credit Suisse then said early Thursday that it is taking measures to shore up its finances, including exercising an option to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($53.7 billion) from the central bank.

“This additional liquidity would support Credit Suisse’s core businesses and clients as Credit Suisse takes the necessary steps to create a simpler and more focused bank built around client needs,” the bank said.

A day earlier, Credit Suisse reported that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned new doubts about the bank’s ability to weather the storm.

Credit Suisse stock dropped about 30%, to about 1.6 Swiss francs ($1.73), before clawing back to a 24% loss at 1.70 francs ($1.83) at the close of trading on the SIX stock exchange. At its lowest, the price was down more than 85% from February 2021.

After the joint announcement from the Swiss National Bank and the Swiss financial markets regulator, the shares also made up some ground on Wall Street.

The stock has suffered a long, sustained decline: In 2007, the bank’s shares traded at more than 80 francs ($86.71) each.

With concerns about the possibility of more hidden trouble in the banking system , investors were quick to sell bank stocks.

France’s Societe Generale SA dropped 12% at one point. France’s BNP Paribas fell more than 10%. Germany’s Deutsche Bank tumbled 8%, and Britain’s Barclays Bank was down nearly 8%. Trading in the two French banks was briefly suspended.

The STOXX Banks index of 21 leading European lenders sagged 8.4% following relative calm in the markets Tuesday.

The turbulence came a day ahead of a meeting by the European Central Bank . President Christine Lagarde said last week, before the U.S. failures, that the bank would “very likely” increase interest rates by a half percentage point to fight against inflation. Markets were watching closely to see if the bank carries through despite the latest turmoil.

Credit Suisse is “a much bigger concern for the global economy” than the midsize U.S. banks that collapsed, said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist for Capital Economics.

It has multiple subsidiaries outside Switzerland and handles trading for hedge funds.

“Credit Suisse is not just a Swiss problem but a global one,” he said.

He noted, however, that the bank’s “problems were well known so do not come as a complete shock to either investors or policymakers.”

The troubles “once more raise the question about whether this is the beginning of a global crisis or just another ‘idiosyncratic’ case,” Kenningham said in a note. ”Credit Suisse was widely seen as the weakest link among Europe’s large banks, but it is not the only bank which has struggled with weak profitability in recent years.”

Leaving a Credit Suisse branch in Geneva, Fady Rachid said he and his wife are worried about the bank’s health. He planned to transfer some money to UBS.

“I find it hard to believe that Credit Suisse is going to be able to get rid of these problems and get through it,” said Rachid, a 56-year-old doctor.

The Swiss National Bank declined to comment. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority did not immediately respond to calls and emails seeking comment.

Investors responded to “a broader structural problem” in banking following a long period of low interest rates and “very, very loose monetary policy,” said Sascha Steffen, professor of finance at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management.

In order to earn some yield, banks “needed to take more risks, and some banks did this more prudently than others.”

Now investors are worried that banks “have risks on their balance sheet that they don’t know about and therefore have accumulated significant losses that haven’t been yet realized.”

European finance ministers said this week that their banking system has no direct exposure to the U.S. bank failures.

Europe strengthened its banking safeguards after the global financial crisis that followed the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008 by transferring supervision of the biggest banks to the central bank, analysts said. The central bank is considered less likely than national supervisors to look the other way at developing problems.

The Credit Suisse parent bank is not part of EU supervision, but it has entities in several European countries that are. Credit Suisse is subject to international rules requiring it to maintain financial buffers against losses as one of 30 so-called globally systemically important banks, or G-SIBs.

Share prices plunged after Saudi National Bank Chairman Ammar Al Khudairy told Bloomberg and Reuters that the bank has ruled out further investments in Credit Suisse to avoid regulations that kick in with a stake above 10%.

The Saudi National Bank has invested some 1.5 billion Swiss francs to acquire a holding just under that threshold.

The Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds , repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving Zurich rival UBS.

In an annual report released Tuesday, Credit Suisse said customer deposits fell 41%, or by 159.6 billion francs ($172.1 billion), at the end of last year compared with a year earlier.

March 21 (Reuters) - UBS (UBSG.S) is set to enter talks with Michael Klein to terminate a deal that would have seen the Wall Street dealmaker take control of much of Credit Suisse's (CSGN.S) investment bank, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.

UBS on Sunday agreed to buy rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.23 billion) in stock and agreed to assume up to 5 billion francs ($5.4 billion) in losses, in a shotgun merger engineered by Swiss authorities to avoid more market-shaking turmoil in global banking.

Klein, a veteran dealmaker, was merging his eponymous advisory boutique into Credit Suisse's investment banking operations to create CS First Boston as a standalone business which he would have led from New York.

UBS has now assigned a legal team to examine how to void the contract Credit Suisse signed with Klein in the cheapest way possible, according to the FT report, which cited people with direct knowledge of the matter.

""We assume he (Klein) is cherry picking. The deal was done when the selling bank had a gun held to its head and we are no longer in that position,"" a person close to UBS said, according to the report.

UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment, while Klein could not be immediately reached for comment.

https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-writes-down-17-bln-bonds-zero-angering-holders-2023-03-19/,"Credit Suisse says $17 billion debt worthless, angering bondholders","













LONDON/NEW YORK, March 19 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse said 16 billion Swiss francs ($17.24 billion) of its Additional Tier 1 debt will be written down to zero on the orders of the Swiss regulator as part of its rescue merger with UBS (UBSG.S), angering bondholders on Sunday.

FINMA, the Swiss regulator, said the decision would bolster the bank's capital. The move reflects authorities' desire to see private investors share the pain from Credit Suisse's troubles.

Chair Marlene Amstad said FINMA had stuck to the country's ""too-big-to-fail"" banking framework in making the decision.

It means AT1 bondholders appear to be left with nothing while shareholders, who sit below bonds in the priority ladder for repayment in a bankruptcy process, will receive $3.23 billion under the UBS deal.

Engineered in the wake of the global financial crisis, AT1 bonds are a form of junior debt that counts towards banks' regulatory capital. They were designed as a way to transfer risks to investors and away from taxpayers if a bank gets into trouble.

The bonds can be converted into equity or written down when a lender's capital buffers are eroded beyond a certain threshold.

""It's stunning and hard to understand how they can reverse the hierarchy between AT1 holders and shareholders,"" said Jerome Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments, an investor in Credit Suisse's AT1 debt.

Reuters reported earlier on Sunday that Swiss authorities were considering imposing losses on bondholders as part of the rescue deal.

UBS' CEO Ralph Hamers told analysts that the decision to write down the AT1 bonds to zero was taken by FINMA, so it would not create a liability for the bank.

Credit Suisse's AT1 debt had rallied earlier on Sunday amid reports that shareholders would receive something in a deal with UBS, raising hopes that bondholders would be protected.

The bonds had sunk into distressed territory before the weekend due to mounting concerns over the health of the Swiss lender.

The move by the Swiss regulator could make it harder for other lenders to raise new AT1 debt, investors said.

""It's going to make the AT1 bonds more expensive for all the other banks going forward, because now everyone else is going to see this extra risk,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, partner and chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors.

AT1s pay higher interest as they carry more risk for investors than regular debt.

Prior to Sunday's news, investors had been apprehensive about the prospect of banks extending outstanding AT1 bonds to avoid refinancing at worse terms because of higher interest rates.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/16/investing/credit-suisse-snb-loan-shares/index.html,There's still a fight on Credit Suisse hands despite $54 billion lifeline,"London CNN —

A scramble by Switzerland’s authorities to shore up confidence in Credit Suisse went some way to calming panicked investors Thursday, but the country’s second-biggest bank may yet need more help if it is to survive.

Credit Suisse said it would borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($53.7 billion) from the Swiss National Bank, taking advantage of a lifeline offered by the central bank late Wednesday after the lender’s stock had crashed as much as 30% to a new record low. It also said it would buy back some of its own debt.

In a statement early Thursday, CEO Ulrich Körner said he had taken “decisive action” to strengthen the bank as its continues to implement a major overhaul announced last fall. “My team and I are resolved to move forward rapidly to deliver a simpler and more focused bank built around client needs,” he added.

Credit Suisse’s shares soared 32% at the open but erased some of those gains to close up 19% in Zurich. The cost of buying insurance against the risk of default by the bank eased back from record highs hit Wednesday.

The bank has lost about a quarter of its stock market value since the start of 2023, and more than 70% in the past 12 months, as a series of scandals, missteps and compliance failures have steadily undermined the confidence of investors and clients.

JP Morgan’s banking analysts said the liquidity support offered by the Swiss central bank would not be sufficient, given “ongoing market confidence issues” with Credit Suisse’s plan to carve out its investment bank, and the erosion of the wider business.

Customers withdrew 123 billion Swiss francs ($133 billion) from Credit Suisse in 2022 — mostly in the fourth quarter — and the bank reported in February an annual net loss of nearly 7.3 billion Swiss francs ($7.9 billion), its biggest since the global financial crisis in 2008.

The venerable but troubled bank, founded in 1856, is one of the biggest financial institutions in the world and categorized as a “global systemically important bank,” along with just 30 others, including JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and the Bank of China.

The Swiss National Bank confirmed Thursday that it would provide liquidity to Credit Suisse “against sufficient collateral.”

Not enough?

The cash could buy time for Credit Suisse to restore confidence and push on with restructuring plans that include carving out investment banking into an independent US-based business and focusing on Switzerland as well as on managing money for wealthy clients.

But it may not be out of the woods yet.

“In our view, status quo is no longer an option as counterparty concerns are starting to emerge as reflected by credit/equity markets weakness,” the JP Morgan analysts wrote in a research note Thursday, adding that a takeover — probably by bigger Swiss rival UBS (UBS) — was the most likely endgame.

Local media reported that the Swiss government would hold an extraordinary meeting Thursday to discuss the situation at Credit Suisse, according to Reuters. The finance ministry declined to comment to CNN.

Fears about weaker lenders exploded last week when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in the biggest US banking failure since the global financial crisis. But the trigger for Wednesday’s rout in Credit Suisse shares came from comments by the bank’s biggest backer — the Saudi National Bank — that it wasn’t prepared to put up more money after buying a near-10% stake for $1.5 billion last year.

Speaking on Thursday, the chairman of Saudi Arabia’s biggest bank said the panic was unwarranted.

“It’s panic, a little bit of panic, I believe completely unwarranted whether it be for Credit Suisse or for the entire market,” Ammar Al Khudairy told CNBC.

Problems elsewhere?

Some analysts cautioned that the spotlight might now shift from Credit Suisse to other parts of the financial sector.

“The problems at Credit Suisse are very different to those that brought down SVB a few days ago,” Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients. “But they serve as a reminder that as interest rates rise, vulnerabilities are lurking in the financial system. Key areas to monitor are smaller European banks and shadow banks.”

Interest rates in the euro area have soared from minus 0.5% last June to 2.5% in February. The European Central Bank announced another half-percentage point hike Thursday, taking rates to 3%, as it judged stubbornly high inflation to be more of a risk to the economy than the recent banking turmoil.

The ECB has the tools if needs to respond if there were a liquidity crisis, “but this is not what we are seeing,” ECB President Christine Lagarde told reporters. “Those tools exist; they are strong, they are powerful and they can be reactivated any time.”

ECB vice president Luis de Guindos said that the boost to bank profits from rising interest rates “more than offsets” any losses they might suffer on their holdings of government bonds as a consequence of higher borrowing costs.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/banking-giant-ubs-announces-acquisition-of-credit-suisse-amid-financial-turmoil,Banking giant UBS announces acquisition of Credit Suisse amid financial turmoil,"BERN, Switzerland (AP) — Banking giant UBS is buying its smaller rival Credit Suisse in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in global banking, Swiss President Alain Berset announced on Sunday night.

Swiss president Alain Berset, who did not specify a value of the deal, called the announcement “one of great breadth for the stability of international finance. An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.”

Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s globally systemic important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

Sunday’s news conference follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further bank panics. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse’s share price began plummeting this week.

READ MORE: Analysis: Why Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed so fast

The 167-year-old Credit Suisse already received a $50 billion (54 million Swiss francs) loan from the Swiss National Bank, which briefly caused a rally in the bank’s stock price. Yet the move did not appear to be enough to stem an outflow of deposits, according to news reports.

Still, many of Credit Suisse’s problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.

The deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn’t invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10 percent.

On Friday, shares dropped 8 percent to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.

Its current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.

While smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.

Despite the banking turmoil, the European Central Bank on Thursday approved a large, half-percentage point increase in interest rates to try to curb stubbornly high inflation, saying Europe’s banking sector is “resilient,” with strong finances.

ECB President Christine Lagarde said the banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.

Shares of Credit Suisse on Wednesday plunged to a fresh all-time low for the second consecutive day after a top investor in the embattled Swiss bank said it would not be able to provide any more cash due to regulatory restrictions.

Trading in the bank's plummeting stock was halted several times throughout the morning as it fell below 2 Swiss francs ($2.17) for the first time.

Swiss-listed Credit Suisse shares ended the session down 24%, paring some of its earlier losses after dropping more than 30% at one point. The U.S.-traded American depositary receipts of Credit Suisse were last down about 15%.

After European markets closed, Swiss regulators said that Credit Suisse currently meets capital and liquidity requirements and that the Swiss National Bank will provide additional liquidity if necessary.

The share price rout renewed a broader sell-off among European lenders, which were already facing significant market turmoil as a result of the Silicon Valley Bank fallout. Some of the biggest decliners included France's Societe Generale, Spain's Banco de Sabadell and Germany's Commerzbank .

Several Italian banks on Wednesday were also subject to automatic trading stoppages, including UniCredit , FinecoBank and Monte dei Paschi .

Credit Suisse's largest investor, Saudi National Bank, said it could not provide the Swiss bank with any further financial assistance, according to a Reuters report, sparking the latest leg lower.

""We cannot because we would go above 10%. It's a regulatory issue,"" Saudi National Bank Chairman Ammar Al Khudairy told Reuters on Wednesday. However, he added that SNB is happy with Credit Suisse's transformation plan and suggested the bank was unlikely to need extra money.

But European bank stocks and the wider market gained as investors watch whether moves to shore up banks will stem further upheaval in the global banking system.

Shares of Credit Suisse, whose woes stem from questions over its internal controls, fell 60% a day after UBS said it would buy the fellow Swiss bank for a lowball price of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion). Credit Suisse stocks were down 53%, trading at 93 cents a share as of 11:08 a.m. Eastern time.

Swiss regulators orchestrated the purchase in a bid to stop more turmoil after the collapse of two U.S. banks. In an indication of the frantic, behind-the-scenes deal-making by Swiss authorities to resolve the issue before markets opened, the acquisition was announced late Sunday.

There is still uncertainty over how the deal will play out for the combined bank. Analysts say some previous forced bank mergers didn't work out well for shareholders in the long run.

""Only time will tell how this shotgun wedding is received,"" said Neil Shearing, group chief economist for Capital Economics.

""While the deal may not be perfect, it takes care of a situation that has been plagued by rumor, scandal and a series of seemingly non-stop problems within Credit Suisse,"" Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial said in an email.

UBS shares initially fell on the Swiss stock exchange but had gained more than 6% in afternoon trading. The deal added volatility to other European bank stocks, which fell in early trading even as benchmark indexes climbed, before some clawed back their losses. Germany's Deutsche Bank, France's BNP Paribas and Italy's UniCredit were up, while London-based Barclays sank 3%.

Takeover by UBS

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after a central bank plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) last week failed to reassure investors and customers. Shares of Credit Suisse and other banks had tumbled last week after the failure of two banks in the U.S. raised questions about other potentially weak global financial institutions.

Many of Credit Suisse's problems were unique and unlike the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S. It has faced an array of troubles in recent years, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

Analysts and financial leaders say safeguards are stronger since the 2008 global financial crisis and that banks worldwide have plenty of available cash and support from central banks. But concerns about risks to the deal, losses for some investors and Credit Suisse's falling market value could renew fears about the health of banks.

Tobias Straumann, an economic history professor at University of Zurich, said the merger was the right move because the U.S. bank collapses and the danger to Credit Suisse was ""an international banking crisis in the making.""

""Markets are very nervous, and I think an additional accident in Switzerland would have fueled a lot of problems,"" he said.

Now, the focus will be on whether problems emerge in other banks or parts of the financial system, Shearing said.

""Containing crises is a bit like a game of whack-a-mole — with new fires starting as existing ones are extinguished,"" Shearing said.

""Too big to fail"" bank

Credit Suisse is among 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities were worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

UBS is bigger but Credit Suisse wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. It has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich through its wealth management business, and is a major mergers and acquisitions adviser. However, Credit Suisse weathered the 2008 financial crisis without assistance, unlike UBS.

Switzerland's executive branch passed an emergency ordinance allowing the merger to go through without shareholder approval.

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in higher-risk Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out, leaving investors with hefty losses. That has triggered concern about the market for those bonds and for other banks that hold them.

The combination of the two biggest and best-known Swiss banks, each with histories dating to the mid-19th century, strikes at Switzerland's reputation as a global financial center — putting it on the cusp of having a single national banking champion.

Collapse of two U.S. banks

The deal follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent further panic.

In a bid to shore up the global financial system, the world's central banks announced coordinated moves to stabilize banks, including access to a lending facility for banks to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice widely used during the 2008 crisis.

UBS officials said they plan to sell off parts of Credit Suisse or reduce the bank's size.

To support the deal, the Swiss central bank is providing a loan of up to 100 billion francs and the government is providing another 100 billion francs of support as a backstop if needed.

As the market tries to figure out what comes next after the merger, Straumann, the professor, said he wouldn't be surprised to see problems for regional banks in Europe after further interest rate increases, much like what happened to midsized banks in U.S.

""The banking system of Europe has not fully recovered from the crisis"" in 2008, he said. ""It's better, of course, than it used to be, but it's vulnerable.""",[],

This comes after UBS agreed to buy rival Credit Suisse for $3.23 billion in stock last month, and assume up to $5.4 billion in losses.

According to a report in Bloomberg, the global head of wealth management at UBS, Iqbal Khan, met with Credit Suisse executives including the local lender’s wealth head Puneet Matta in Singapore. Khan then reportedly told the Credit Suisse staff that the wealth business in India is likely to be retained.

Khan was in Credit Suisse before he left for UBS in 2019. UBS had left India by 2014, exiting the country’s private-wealth market. The return is expected to pave the way for UBS into the market as the number of billionaires in India continues to rise.

As per the report, the merger would see large parts of Credit Suisse’s investment bank wind down. The lender has just over 40 wealth management employees and around 7,000 overall employees in the country.

The deal inked between UBS and Credit Suisse last month includes $108 billion in liquidity assistance for UBS and Credit Suisse from the Swiss central bank. The federal government is providing a loss guarantee of a maximum 9 billion Swiss francs to enable UBS take over Credit Suisse.

This will be activated if losses are actually incurred on this portfolio. In that eventuality, UBS would assume the first 5 billion francs, the federal government the next 9 billion francs, and UBS would assume any further losses, the government said.

Once the world knows a bank is in government-led talks about a rescue deal, then it’s a deal that has to be done. Credit Suisse Group AG could not afford to go into the opening of Asian markets with its own national authorities having questioned its viability. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The Swiss government said it had to act after heavy deposit outflows late last week. The Swiss National Bank’s $54 billion liquidity support handed to Credit Suisse on Wednesday didn’t restore faith. Opening on Monday without a solution in place would have very likely meant a death spiral for Credit Suisse and mayhem for markets.

UBS Group AG is the reluctant rescuer even at a bargain price of roughly $3.25 billion, paid in UBS shares. Credit Suisse’s last reported tangible equity value was about $45 billion. UBS is picking up its local rival for just 7% of what it should be worth -- and little more than double what Saudi National Bank paid for just a 9.9% stake late last year. In addition, $17 billion of junior debt designed to be written down in a banking failure is being wiped out completely. Plus, Switzerland is giving UBS a near-$10 billion guarantee over losses on certain assets, after UBS has taken an initial $5.4 billion of losses.

As the government-preferred buyer, UBS had a strong hand and drove a very hard deal. The cost to Credit Suisse stock and junior bondholders and to the Swiss government covers a lot of potential asset losses. Even at such a price, the deal is not without risks for UBS: The cost of insuring its bonds against default jumped on news of the takeover. When JPMorgan Chase & Co. took over Bear Stearns for just $2 per share in 2008 and with a similar but larger government guarantee on certain asset losses, it still ended up regretting the trade.

UBS didn’t want the management distraction or the risks and responsibilities that come from such a massive takeover. The bank had its own brush with death during the 2008 crisis and swiftly ditched much of its investment bank, especially those parts that traded debt.

Based on accounts from the end of 2022, the deal increases UBS’s total assets by 52% to about 1.6 trillion francs ($1.7 trillion), but it increases risk-weighted assets by 78% to 570 billion francs. Risk-weighted assets is the measure used to assess a bank’s capital needs. Credit Suisse doesn’t have a ton of bad assets, but they are riskier.

UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher told reporters that it would cut Credit Suisse’s investment bank significantly. The bits that UBS will keep will leave the enlarged group’s investment bank and trading desks needing no more than 25% of its capital.

That sounds like it could be brutal. Credit Suisse’s last reported RWA for its investment bank was only 32% of its total RWA. Add this to UBS, and the combined group would have just over 30% of its capital in investment banking. However, UBS might also view a lot of the capital Credit Suisse carries for operational risks as being attached to its investment bank. It also wants to rapidly slash Credit Suisse’s 30 billion francs of non-core assets.

The faster UBS looks to sell assets out of Credit Suisse’s investment bank, the greater the losses it would have to take. UBS is protected by having wiped out most of Credit Suisse’s equity and all its junior bonds, along with the government guarantee. But it will still be a tricky job with some tough choices and UBS might end up holding on to some of this business longer than it wants. The outlook for the revival of a separated First Boston brand meant to be led by dealmaker Michael Klein doesn’t look great, to say the least.

What Kelleher is happy to take on is the global wealth management business. And he’s determined to keep the domestic Swiss bank. The combined businesses could still lose some rich clients: Anyone still a client of both banks will likely want to diversify some of their assets to another institution. Acquiring the domestic Swiss bank will significantly increase the market share of the combined group and it could lose clients there too.

Despite the risks, UBS is getting a bank that was not finally brought down by bad assets but by a wave of liquidity fears rolling around the world. Credit Suisse was vulnerable because its shares had been battered by concerns about its long-term profitability and a prolonged period of uncertainty about its strategy had led to a loss of bankers and business. It was not laid low by fears about bad assets, which was what killed long-lived brokers like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

The Swiss government added a 100 billion-franc liquidity backstop to the takeover agreement, which protects UBS from further deposit flight while markets are still fragile. The whole deal was welcomed by the central banks of the US, UK and Europe as well – each fretting about the potential for further fallout from a Credit Suisse collapse. A coordinated program to supply dollars to the global financial system was also announced on Sunday.

There are lots of details still to be revealed and questions will yet be asked – for example bondholders will be aghast to be wiped out when shareholders are getting paid at least something. But the bigger dangers of letting Credit Suisse suffer an accelerating run were clear: This takeover ought to contain the chaos.

https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/troubles-credit-suisse-prompt-broader-market-selloff-rcna75037,Swiss regulator offers lifeline to Credit Suisse after its troubles rattle global markets,"Swiss regulators stepped in to reassure global financial markets after fresh fears about the viability of Credit Suisse threatened wider fallout just days after two historic U.S. bank failures.

The Swiss National Bank offered the embattled lender financial support if necessary in a statement issued late Wednesday, a move that helped markets pare some of the day’s steep losses.

Credit Suisse shares closed 14% lower in U.S. trading. Other bank stocks took hits, as well, with JPMorgan closing down 4% and Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs closing down about 3%. Bank of America closed down less than 1%.

The broader Dow Jones Industrial Index ended Wednesday's session down about 280 points — roughly 0.9% — while the S&P 500 closed 0.7% lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished the day roughly flat.

Analysts said the turmoil increased the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will hold its fire on raising interest rates aggressively when it meets next week, even as inflation remains elevated.

The risk of roiling markets further “makes it more likely that they pass on raising rates,” Pantheon Macroeconomics Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson wrote in a note to clients late Wednesday. “It is more important, in our view, not to take risks with the stability of the system than to reassert your determination to fight inflation.”

Wednesday's broad-based fallout was sparked in part when Credit Suisse’s largest shareholder, Saudi National Bank, said it had ruled out adding to its existing investments to help steady the embattled lender.

Credit Suisse shares had tanked as much as 25% in morning trading, and the turmoil quickly spread across the banking sector and beyond. Even traditionally safer assets, including U.S. government bonds, took a pummeling, although yields began to tick back up before markets closed.","['Https', 'Media-Cldnry.S-Nbcnews.Com Image Upload Newscms', 'Rob Wile', 'Rob Wile Is A Breaking Business News Reporter For Nbc News Digital.']",

The demise of banking giant Credit Suisse sent shock waves through financial markets and appears to have dealt a blow to Switzerland's reputation for stability, with one executive suggesting investors will now look at the mountainous central European country as ""a financial banana republic.""

The rescue deal means Switzerland, a country heavily dependent on finance for its economy, is on track to see its two biggest and best-known banks merge into just one financial giant. ""Switzerland's standing as a financial centre is shattered,"" Octavio Marenzi, CEO of Opimas, said in a research note. ""The country will now be viewed as a financial banana republic.""

""The Credit Suisse debacle will have serious ramifications for other Swiss financial institutions. A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,"" Marenzi said. A spokesperson for the Swiss regulator FINMA declined to comment. Shares of Swiss-listed UBS on Tuesday rose 7.3% by around 12:50 p.m. London time (8:50 a.m. ET), extending gains after closing higher in the previous session. Credit Suisse traded up 3.5% during afternoon deals after ending Monday's session down a whopping 55%.

Credit Suisse bond wipeout

Under the terms of the emergency takeover, investors in Credit Suisse's additional tier-one bonds — widely regarded as a relatively risky investment — will see the value of their holdings slashed to zero. It means investments worth roughly 16 billion francs will become worthless. AT1 bonds, also known as contingent convertibles or ""CoCos,"" are a type of debt that is considered part of a bank's regulatory capital. Holders can convert them into equity or write them down in certain situations – for example when a bank's capital ratio falls below a previously agreed threshold. ""The extraordinary government support will trigger a complete write-down of the nominal value of all AT1 debt of Credit Suisse in the amount of around CHF 16 billion, and thus an increase in core capital,"" FINMA said Sunday.

The unconventional move is at odds with the typical practice of prioritizing bondholders over shareholders when a bank fails and prompted turmoil in the market for convertible bank bonds on Monday. Vítor Constâncio, who served as the vice president of the European Central Bank from 2010 to 2018, said via Twitter that FINMA's announcement was a ""mistake with consequences and potentially a host of court cases."" The ECB and Britain's Bank of England both sought to distance themselves from FINMA's decision.

European Union regulators, composed of the ECB, the European Banking Authority and the Single Resolution Board, said Monday that they would continue to impose losses on shareholders before bondholders. ""This approach has been consistently applied in past cases and will continue to guide the actions of the SRB and ECB banking supervision in crisis interventions,"" they said. The Bank of England echoed this sentiment shortly thereafter. ""Holders of such instruments should expect to be exposed to losses in resolution or insolvency in the order of their positions in this hierarchy,"" the BOE said.

What about the Swiss franc as a safe haven?

""One feature of this whole banking pressure that we've seen over the last week or two is that actually yes we've seen major volatility in equity markets, major volatility in fixed income markets, and also commodity markets, but very little volatility in foreign exchange markets,"" Bob Parker, senior advisor at the International Capital Markets Association, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday. Asked about how investors might now think of Switzerland's reputation for stability, Parker replied, ""When I was in Zurich last week, this subject actually was a hot topic.""

https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/09/investing/credit-suisse-losses/index.html,Credit Suisse posts biggest loss since 2008,"London CNN —

Credit Suisse (CS) has reported its biggest annual loss since the financial crisis in 2008, highlighting the scale of the challenge facing the scandal-plagued Swiss bank as it attempts a turnaround.

The lender on Thursday posted a loss of 1.4 billion Swiss francs ($1.5 billion) in the fourth quarter of 2022, extending a losing streak that started in 2021 and taking its full-year loss to 7.3 billion Swiss francs ($7.9 billion). In 2008, Credit Suisse made a loss of 8.2 billion Swiss francs ($8.9 billion).

The bank’s shares fell 5% in early trade. The stock has plunged 65% over the past 12 months but is up 12% so far in 2023.

Credit Suisse said in a statement that the fourth-quarter performance was impacted by “the challenging economic and market environment, significant deposit and net asset outflows at the beginning of the quarter and the execution of our strategic actions.” It added that it expected to make another “substantial loss” in 2023.

Customers withdrew 111 billion Swiss francs ($121 billion) in the final three months of 2022, when the bank was hit by social media speculation that it was on the brink of collapse.

The rumors, which sparked a selloff in the shares, followed a series of missteps and compliance failures that have cost the bank dearly.

For example, the collapse of US hedge fund Archegos Capital Management, a client of Credit Suisse, in 2021 cost the bank $5.5 billion. An independent external investigation later found “a failure to effectively manage risk.”

Credit Suisse has since embarked on a major restructuring plan that entails cutting 9,000 full-time jobs, spinning off its investment bank and focusing on wealth management.

In a step towards this, the company announced Thursday the acquisition of M. Klein & Company, an investment banking business.

Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Körner said the deal “marks another milestone in the carve-out of CS First Boston as a leading independent capital markets and advisory business.”

The bank also announced that it had finalized the first stage of the deal to sell its securitized products group to Apollo Global Management, which is expected to conclude in the first half of this year.

“We have a clear plan to create a new Credit Suisse and intend to continue to deliver on our three-year strategic transformation by reshaping our portfolio, reallocating capital, right-sizing our cost base, and building on our leading franchises.” Körner said in the statement.

https://fortune.com/2023/03/24/europe-banks-will-pay-for-wiping-out-credit-suisse-bondholders-tidjane-thiam/,Europe will pay for wiping out Credit Suisse bondholders,"The fateful decision by Swiss authorities to impose full losses on certain bondholders of failed lender Credit Suisse will make life more difficult for European banks going forward, warned the institute’s former CEO.

In a column published in the Financial Times on Thursday, Tidjane Thiam argued the distressed sale to cross-town rival UBS upended international finance’s traditional hierarchy, in which stock owners such as the Saudi National Bank are always the first to lose their shirts when a company fails.

Instead the all-share deal forces investors that bought $17 billion in so-called Additional Tier 1 bonds to take a bath, argued the Ivorian, who served as CEO from 2015 until February 2020. This precedent could prove costly for lenders on the continent by further pushing up their funding costs.

“There is a basic principle that common equity takes the hit first,” he wrote, amid reports that affected bondholders are considering taking legal action.

“It seems that the treatment of AT1s, even if correct under the current Swiss rules, will raise the cost of capital for Swiss banks and European banks. This will have some of their U.S. peers rubbing their hands,” Thiam added.

The market is already pricing in higher capital costs for European banks

The deal values Credit Suisse’s equity at 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion). While the terms impose heavy losses on shareholders—with the battered stock losing a further two-thirds overnight— investors like the Saudi National Bank that pumped in 1.5 billion francs late last year did not lose everything.

By upending the traditional heirarchy of a bank resolution, bondholders will likely demand a higher return on their investment before subscribing to the next AT1 issue, according to Thiam.

“This new layer of uncertainty will have an adverse impact on the competitiveness of the European banking sector. Net net, U.S. and Asian rivals could come out of all this relatively stronger.

In fact investors are already pricing this added risk in, with shares in German lender Deutsche Bank selling off hard on Friday. Other European banks like UBS, Société Générale and UniCredit were also hit, albeit to a lesser degree.

The cost for credit default swaps, a financial instrument that effectively protects investors against a company’s insolvency, has also soared. This can be seen in particular for “subordinated” debt that paid back only after senior-ranked creditors are made whole, a reflection of the jitters around AT1 bonds.

Understanding the potential impact from the controversial move, banking regulators at Frankfurt’s Single Resolution Board and European Central Bank distanced themselves from the Swiss solution, making clear that in the euro zone common shareholders would always be the first to get wiped out before any AT1 bondholders would take a hit.

“This approach has been consistently applied in past cases and will continue to guide the actions of the SRB and ECB banking supervision in crisis interventions,” they said in a joint statement on Monday.

Why do banks even issue ‘Additional Tier 1’ securities?

AT1 bonds were created as an answer to the question of how to make lenders more resilient without cutting off the supply of credit to the real economy.

In the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, European regulators wanted banks to build more powerful shock absorbers into their balance sheet to guard against the need for unpopular taxpayer bailouts.

But issuing fresh common equity in the form of new shares—the highest quality form of capital around—is also the costliest. Achieving more robust levels of solvency by mandating ratios of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) that was disproportionately higher to their overall asset base than elsewhere would have two effects.

Firstly it would limit European banks’ profitability, putting them at a structural disadvantage to foreign peers permitted to operate with more leveraged balance sheets. Secondly, it would lower their appetite to extend loans in particular to small and medium size businesses that tend to be the lifeblood of an economy.

Enter contingently convertible (CoCo) debt.

Under the new “Basel III” regulatory regime—which the U.S. importantly has yet to adopt—a new asset class was created: AT1 bonds that would either be written off or automatically convert to loss-absorbing common equity should a bank’s solvency buffers be fully depleted.

In exchange for the risk investors could be “bailed-in” at any time and lose everything, these securities would offer bondholders a higher return over more senior ranked debt paid out first in the event of bankruptcy.

On Wednesday, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser lauded Monday’s statement from European regulators guaranteeing common equity owners would lose everything before AT1 bondholders took a hit, saying it provided greater certainty for banks and their investors.

“I think all of us were quite relieved when that clarification came out, as it obviously took people by surprise,” she said.",['Christiaan Hetzner'],2023-03-24 00:00:00

Switzerland’s role as banker to the world’s rich is built on a reputation for institutional discretion and dull reliability. That only makes the scandals, public legal battles and mounting losses at Credit Suisse Group AG more striking and hard to comprehend. In mid-March, unease about the bank’s mounting problems snowballed and its shares slumped, forcing management to appeal to Swiss banking authorities for a public vote of confidence.

1. What went wrong?

Credit Suisse’s failings have included a criminal conviction for allowing drug dealers to launder money in Bulgaria, entanglement in a Mozambique corruption case, a spying scandal involving a former employee and an executive and a massive leak of client data to the media. Its association with disgraced financier Lex Greensill and failed New York-based investment firm Archegos Capital Management compounded the sense of an institution that didn’t have a firm grip on its affairs. Many fed up clients have voted with their feet, leading to unprecedented client outflows in late 2022.

2. What triggered the latest share slump?

Chief Executive Officer Ulrich Koerner launched a massive outreach to woo back nervous clients and their cash. The effort appeared to be paying off by January, with it reported “net positive” deposits. However, on March 9, the US Securities and Exchange Commission queried the bank’s annual report, forcing it to delay its publication. Panic spread after regional US lender Silicon Valley Bank failed, the victim in part of risky investments and rising global interest rates that eroded the value of its bond holdings. Investors began ditching anything that smelled of banking risk and deposit flight.

3. How bad did the situation get?

On March 15, Credit Suisse stock slumped anew when the chairman of its largest shareholder, Saudi National Bank, ruled out investing any more in the company. This prompted Credit Suisse to ask the Swiss central bank for a public statement of support. The cost of insuring the bank’s bonds against default for one year surged to levels not seen for major international banks since the financial crisis of 2008. As other banks sought to hedge their counterparty risk for transactions with Credit Suisse, quoted prices for a one-year credit default swap jumped from 836 basis points, indicating a probability of defaulting of 10%, on March 14 to higher than 3,000 basis points. Few actual trades were executed, however, as liquidity in the market dried up. In another sign of stress, Credit Suisse’s additional tier 1 bonds — which are subordinate to all other ranks of debt and may be written down if capital falls below a predetermined level — were trading below 80% of face value, a level typically signaling distress. Even bonds coming due in April traded at prices well below face value.

4. Is this another Lehman Brothers moment?

The Wall Street giant, whose failure in 2008 triggered the global financial crisis, succumbed when funding dried up and other banks stopped dealing with it. Unlike Lehman and SVB, Credit Suisse has substantial liquid assets to call upon and access to central bank lending facilities and is less sensitive than many rivals to sharp moves in interest rates. It has rebuilt its cushion against more deposit withdrawals since the worst wave of outflows in October. It also has enough money-like liquid assets to pay back half of all its liabilities in deposits and loans from other banks, according to Bloomberg Opinion banking columnist Paul J. Davies. Koerner said the firm’s liquidity coverage ratio showed it can handle over a month of heavy outflows in a period of stress.

5. What else is Koerner doing to turn things around?

His three-year recovery plan involves 9,000 job cuts, dismantling the investment banking behemoth assembled over five decades and returning Credit Suisse to its origins as banker to the world’s ultra-wealthy. That means spinning off First Boston, an American investment bank it acquired in 1990 with a view to listing it in 2025, and selling parts of its securitized products unit to Apollo Global Management Inc. That process is now at risk of becoming bogged down in a broader financial-sector selloff following the collapse of SVB and two other US banks.

NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / April 14, 2023 / WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS) between March 10, 2022 and March 20, 2023, both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The Class Period was expanded to include more investors. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than May 8, 2023.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Credit Suisse securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Credit Suisse class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=12359 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] or [email protected] for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than May 8, 2023. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) contrary to Defendant Lehmann's representations in December 2022, the sharp increase in customer outflows Credit Suisse began experiencing in October 2022 remained ongoing; (2) accordingly, Credit Suisse had downplayed the impact of the Company's recent series of quarterly losses and risk and compliance failures on liquidity and its ability to retain client funds; (3) as a result, Credit Suisse had overstated the Company's financial position and/or prospects; and (4) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

To join the Credit Suisse class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=12359 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] or cas[email protected] for information on the class action.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/27/saudi-national-bank-chair-resigns-credit-suisse-ammar-al-khudairy,Saudi National Bank chair resigns after Credit Suisse comments,"The chair of the Saudi National Bank has resigned for “personal reasons” less than two weeks after his comments spurred investor panic over Credit Suisse that ended in an emergency takeover by its larger Swiss rival, UBS.

The Saudi National Bank (SNB), which was Credit Suisse’s largest shareholder, announced on Monday that it had “accepted” Ammar Al Khudairy’s resignation, and that he would be immediately replaced by its chief executive.

The Middle Eastern bank gave little detail regarding the swift replacement, saying only that Al Khudairy was stepping down “due to personal reasons”, according to a statement released to the Saudi stock exchange.

Al Khudairy’s exit comes less than two weeks after he told journalists that SNB had ruled out providing any further funding for Credit Suisse, because of additional regulations that would kick in if its stake in the Swiss lender – then at 9.9% – went above 10%.

“The answer is absolutely not,” he told Bloomberg, a point which he repeated to other reporters on the sidelines of a financial conference in the Saudi capital on 15 March.

Despite also assuring that the 166-year-old Swiss lender was “a very strong bank” and was unlikely to need more cash, the damage had been done. Al Khudairy’s comments spooked investors, who sent Credit Suisse shares plunging to record lows amid fears that SNB’s reluctance to could limit emergency funding for the already-embattled lender.

The Swiss authorities were forced to step in, originally offering a 50bn Swiss franc (£45bn) line of credit, and eventually orchestrating an emergency takeover of Credit Suisse by its larger domestic rival UBS that was confirmed only four days afterAl Khudairy’s comments.

The swift action by Swiss regulators were part of efforts to curb further panic over the state of the global financial system, which started after the US tech lender Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, and triggered government intervention earlier this month.

The rump of Silicon Valley Bank is being taken over by First Citizens, a North Carolina lender, and its collapse will cost $20bn (£16bn) in deposit insurance payouts.

SNB has said it lost more than $1bn (£816m) in the cut-price takeover, which offered Credit Suisse investors 0.76 Swiss francs a share. The Saudi bank paid 3.82 Swiss francs a share when it bought its stake during a fundraising drive, which was meant to shore up Credit Suisse’s balance sheet and support its restructuring plans, in the autumn.

SNB later revealed in a market statement that its investment in Credit Suisse made up less than 0.5% of its total assets and 1.7% of its investment portfolio. “Changes in the valuation of SNB’s investment in Credit Suisse have no impact on SNB’s growth plans and forward looking 2023 guidance,” it said.

Bank shares rebounded on Monday, suggesting some calm had been restored after weeks of turmoil across global markets as investors feared a repeat of 2008’s financial crisis.

In the UK, Barclays shares jumped almost 3%, while HSBC rose 1.3%. NatWest also rose by 1.1% and Lloyds shares climbed 1.3%, helping lift the FTSE 100by 0.9% on Monday by the close of trading.

The Swiss-listed stock's rally cooled slightly during the day's trading, but the shares were still up 18.8% as markets closed in the afternoon.

The embattled lender announced late Wednesday that it would exercise its option to borrow from the Swiss central bank under a covered loan facility and a short-term liquidity facility.

The Swiss National Bank and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority said in a statement Wednesday that Credit Suisse ""meets the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks.""

Credit Suisse also offered to buy back around 3 billion francs' worth of debt, relating to 10 U.S. dollar-denominated senior debt securities and four euro-denominated senior debt securities.

""These measures demonstrate decisive action to strengthen Credit Suisse as we continue our strategic transformation to deliver value to our clients and other stakeholders,"" Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Koerner said in the release Wednesday.

""We thank the [Swiss National Bank] and FINMA as we execute our strategic transformation. My team and I are resolved to move forward rapidly to deliver a simpler and more focused bank built around client needs.""

The stock of Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second-largest bank, began to slide at the start of the week, along with many other European banks, on fears of contagion in light of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

""As at December 2022, SNB's investment in Credit Suisse constituted less than 0.5% of SNB's total Assets, and c. 1.7% of SNB's investments portfolio,"" Saudi National Bank said in a statement.

Saudi shareholder 'shot themselves in the foot'

Credit Suisse's demise was a long time coming, with a culmination of years of scandals, multibillion-dollar losses, leadership changes and a strategy that failed to inspire investor confidence. In February, the bank — Switzerland's second largest — reported its biggest annual loss since the 2008 financial crisis after clients withdrew more than 110 billion francs. In December 2022, Credit Suisse raised some $4 billion in funding from investors, including major Gulf banks and sovereign wealth funds like Saudi National Bank, the Qatar Investment Authority and the Saudi Olayan Group. Norway's sovereign wealth fund, Norges Bank Investment Management, is also a major shareholder.

SNB's feeling right now is probably like all shareholders in CS — utter anger that management have let the situation get to this point. Simon Fentham-Fletcher Chief investment officer, Freedom Asset Management

The sharp and sudden downturn that began last week and led to the bank's emergency sale is partially the fault of Saudi National Bank itself, some argue. Saudi National Bank Chairman Ammar Al Khudairy on Wednesday was asked by Bloomberg if it would increase its stake in the troubled Swiss lender. His reply was ""absolutely not, for many reasons outside the simplest reason, which is regulatory and statutory."" The comment triggered investor panic and sent Credit Suisse shares down 24% during that session, although the statement wasn't in fact new; the Saudi bank said in October that it had no plans to expand its holdings beyond the current 9.9%. ""Even though the situation at Credit Suisse was not perfect and investors had a lot of question marks about the future of the bank, SNB didn't help calm down investors and shot themselves in the foot"" with the chairman's comments, one UAE-based investment banker, who requested not to be named due to professional restrictions, told CNBC. ""As the largest shareholders in the bank, they had the most to lose if the bank goes under, and this is exactly what happened,"" the banker said.

The Saudi National Bank chairman did attempt to calm the situation the following day, telling CNBC's Hadley Gamble in Riyadh that ""if you look at how the entire banking sector has dropped, unfortunately, a lot of people were just looking for excuses."" ""It's panic, a little bit of panic. I believe completely unwarranted, whether it be for Credit Suisse or for the entire market,"" Al Khudairy said. His comments ultimately failed to stem the bank's continued rout. The messy fallout, which spilled over across the entire banking sector, has ruptured market confidence and stoked fears of another global banking crisis. Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter set out to reassure angry taxpayers during a news conference Sunday, stressing that ""this is a commercial solution and not a bailout.""

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse//File Photo















LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse's (CSGN.S) head of regulatory compliance, Julian Gooding, is leaving Switzerland's second-biggest bank as part of a sweeping overhaul involving thousands of job cuts, people with knowledge of the departure told Reuters.

Gooding was one of the most senior managers in compliance, overseeing anti-fraud measures as well as matters relating to market conduct and investors protection, said the two people, who asked to remain anonymous.

According to his LinkedIn profile, Gooding had been in the role since January 2022 and previously held senior positions as general counsel in various parts of the bank.

Gooding declined to comment when reached on LinkedIn.

The sources said Gooding's departure is not related to Thursday's postponement by Credit Suisse of the publication of its annual report.

Gooding, who has spent about 18 years at Credit Suisse, reported to Nita Patel, the group chief compliance officer, and his responsibilities will be reassigned, the sources added.

Credit Suisse is cutting 9,000 jobs as part of a restructuring plan announced in October to restore profitability after a series of scandals and losses that have drawn regulatory scrutiny and undermined investors confidence.

Last year, the Swiss bank posted its biggest loss since the global financial crisis of 2008 and warned of more pain to come after customers pulled an unprecedented 110 billion Swiss francs ($117 billion).

Gooding's tasks will be assigned to Roger Senteler, chief compliance officer for the wealth management unit, and Alain Bieger, chief compliance officer for the Swiss bank division, the people said.

Patel plans to hold a global town hall meeting with compliance staff later this month, they added.

Separately, Credit Suisse said on Thursday it was delaying its annual report after a last-minute call from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which raised questions about its earlier financial statements and related controls.

The government has argued that no matter the outcome of the vote, the state’s 109 billion francs (S$162.4 billion) in guarantees for UBS to takeover Credit Suisse are binding.

The government says that is because a small number of lawmakers – the financial delegation – gave their approval at the time the deal was negotiated in March.

Neue Zuercher Zeitung and Tages-Anzeiger, the main German language newspapers in Switzerland, cited the same emergency law expert who disagrees with the government’s assessment.

Both reports also referred to specialists who agreed with the government’s view or acknowledged there was a grey area. One suggested that lawmakers might have voted differently if they thought their ballot actually mattered.

Meanwhile, the parties that opposed the guarantees – Swiss People’s Party (SVP), Greens and Social Democrats – are seeking clarification, Tages-Anzeiger reported.

Data: FactSet; Chart: Axios Visuals

Credit Suisse, the 167 year-old banking behemoth, is not a domino falling in reaction to bank failures in the U.S. — its troubles are of its own making, and have been cascading for over a decade. Still, its current dire predicament could hardly come at a worse time for the global financial system.

Why it matters: Credit Suisse is one of just 30 global financial institutions designated as being systemically important by the international Financial Stability Board. In other words, it's too big to fail.

By the numbers: Credit Suisse had total assets of $574 billion at the end of 2022 — down 37% from $912 billion at the end of 2020. Its asset-management arm supervises another $1.7 trillion in assets. Those numbers dwarf anything seen at Silicon Valley Bank, which had total assets of $212 billion.

Credit Suisse's assets are almost certainly lower today. The spectre of a messy nationalization looms over it, and clients have long been departing it for institutions seen as being much more stable.

Flashback: Credit Suisse has been scandal-prone for decades, with a long history of involvement in bribery, money laundering, tax evasion, corporate espionage, subprime shenanigans, and terrible risk management. (Archegos? Greensill? Credit Suisse was right in the middle of both of them.) The Guardian and Reuters have good summaries of how we got here.

Most recently, Credit Suisse's delayed annual report not only showed a loss of $8 billion — equal to roughly its entire market capitalization — but also revealed ""material weaknesses"" in its accounting for 2021 and 2022. Needless to say, that's not a good look for a global systemically-important bank.

Where it stands: Credit Suisse's largest shareholder, Saudi National Bank, said Wednesday that it can't provide any more capital because of regulations saying it can't own more than 10% of the bank.

Credit Suisse has reportedly asked the Swiss central bank and the Swiss banking regulator to step in with a public show of support, but so far they've stayed quiet.

""The European Central Bank debated the pros and cons of making a public statement to try and calm the waters, but as of Wednesday afternoon it had decided against doing so for fear of only adding to market panic,"" adds the Financial Times.

The U.S. Treasury is also reportedly keeping close tabs on the situation.

Between the lines: The balance-sheet problems that took down SVB are probably even bigger at Credit Suisse. While SVB bought mortgage bonds at 1.5% yields, big European banks were forced to buy sovereign debt at sharply negative yields.

Now that those yields have moved back into positive territory, it is certain that European banks are sitting on massive unrealized losses. But no one really knows how big the numbers are.

What they're saying: Credit Suisse is ""too big to fail and too big to be saved,” says economist Nouriel Roubini.

The bottom line: Credit Suisse can't be allowed to fail. But the market is pricing in something pretty close.","['Felix Salmon', 'Https', 'Www.Axios.Com Authors Fsalmon']",2023-03-15 00:00:00

The decision comes shortly after shares of the lender fell sharply Wednesday, hitting an all-time low for a second consecutive day after its top investor Saudi National Bank was quoted as saying it won't be able to provide further assistance. related investing news UBS says it's time to buy this banking giant with very low risk ahead The latest steps will ""support Credit Suisse's core businesses and clients as Credit Suisse takes the necessary steps to create a simpler and more focused bank built around client needs,"" the company said in an announcement. In addition, the bank is making a cash tender offer in relation to ten U.S. dollar denominated senior debt securities for an aggregate consideration of up to $2.5 billion – as well as a separate offer to four Euro denominated senior debt securities for up to an aggregate 500 million euros, the company said.

""These measures demonstrate decisive action to strengthen Credit Suisse as we continue our strategic transformation to deliver value to our clients and other stakeholders,"" Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Koerner said.

'Little bit of panic'

Saudi National Bank told CNBC that Credit Suisse has not asked for financial assistance and that Wednesday's panic was unwarranted. ""There has been no discussions with Credit Suisse about providing assistance,"" said Ammar Al Khudairy, chairman of Saudi National Bank, Credit Suisse's largest shareholder. ""I don't know where the word 'assistance' came from, there has been no discussions whatsoever since October,"" he told CNBC's Hadley Gamble.

The Swiss National Bank said Wednesday that Credit Suisse is currently well capitalized and that the central bank will provide additional liquidity if necessary, as regulators on both sides of the Atlantic tried to calm fears of a spreading crisis. A statement from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority and the SNB said that Credit Suisse ""meets the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks"" and that the central bank will step in if the situation changes. The regulators also said that the failure of two U.S. regional banks in the past week does not pose a ""direct risk of contagion"" to Swiss banks.

Summary Companies Finma says the regulator is monitoring Credit Suisse

Bank says outflows exceeded $120 billion















ZURICH, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Group (CSGN.S) on Thursday reported its biggest annual loss since the 2008 global financial crisis after rattled clients pulled billions from the bank, and it warned that a further ""substantial"" loss would come this year.

Battered by one scandal after another, the bank saw a sharp acceleration in withdrawals in the fourth quarter, with outflows of more than 110 billion Swiss francs ($120 billion), although it said the picture has been improving.

In a statement, Swiss regulator Finma said that while Credit Suisse's liquidity buffers had a stabilising effect on the bank and are being rebuilt, the regulator ""monitors banks very closely during such situations"".

The results, described as ""catastrophic"" by Ethos, which represents some Credit Suisse shareholders, sent the bank's shares down 14.7% on Thursday to 2.77 francs, valuing the lender at 11.1 billion francs.

Switzerland's second-biggest bank has begun a major overhaul of its business, cutting costs and jobs to revive its fortunes, including creating a separate business for its investment bank under the CS First Boston brand. The bank raised 4 billion Swiss francs from investors in December.

Chief Executive Ulrich Koerner said: ""We have a clear plan to create a new Credit Suisse and intend to continue to deliver on our three-year strategic transformation.""

""We have done a prudent and also hopefully a somewhat careful planning,"" he told reporters.

But analysts were alarmed by the scale of losses and outflows.

Credit Suisse's ""operational performance was even worse than feared and the level of outflows quite staggering"", Thomas Hallett, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said in a note.

""With heavy losses to continue in 2023, we expect to see another wave of downgrades and see no reason to own the shares.""

For the fourth quarter, the bank made a net loss of 1.39 billion francs. That brought its total net loss in 2022 to 7.29 billion francs, marking its second straight year in the red.

The bank also flagged that the wealth management division and investment bank will also probably log losses in the first quarter of 2023.

The wealth management division had outflows of 92.7 billion francs in the fourth quarter, much higher than the 61.9 billion analysts had expected, putting the new total for the division's assets under management at 540.5 billion.

The haemorrhaging of funds last year led it to breach some liquidity requirements, but its finance chief said on Thursday that the problem had since been resolved.

The bank's significant deposit and net asset outflows compounded a generally bleak picture.

Andreas Venditti, an analyst with Vontobel, described last year as ""clearly one of the worst years in Credit Suisse's 167-year history"", and said the future offered little immediate respite.

Among a string of scandals, Credit Suisse was hard hit by the collapse of U.S. investment firm Archegos in 2021, as well as the freezing of billions of supply chain finance funds linked to insolvent British financier Greensill.

Other scandals to rock the bank included a prosecution in Switzerland involving laundering money for a criminal gang.

INVESTMENT BANK

Credit Suisse's investment bank made a loss of 3.8 billion francs in 2022 - roughly the same amount it paid to the division's staff.

The bank said it racked up the heavy loss as trading revenues tumbled, but it also pointed to the impact of ""accelerated deleveraging"" triggered by the ""significant deposit outflows"" in the final three months of last year.

On the plan to spin off the investment bank, Credit Suisse said it had bought former board member Michael Klein's advisory boutique for $175 million.

The plans have already prompted concerns from some investors about potential conflicts of interest.

On Thursday Ethos Foundation, which represents some Credit Suisse shareholders, said it raised ""governance concerns"" and that little information had been revealed about the deal.

Ethos Chief Executive Vincent Kaufmann told Reuters he was surprised by how much had been paid ""given the little information we have today on this company founded and managed by Mr. Klein, member of the board of directors of Credit Suisse until October 2022 and designated CEO of the buyer (CSFB)"".

Credit Suisse did not give details of other investors that may back the investment bank. Koerner last year said it had a $500 million commitment from an investor, without naming them.

Last November, rating agency Standard & Poor's downgraded the bank to just one level above junk.

Fears for the stability of the global financial system rose Wednesday after Credit Suisse disclosed problems in its financial reporting and said it would tap up to $53.7 billion in aid from Switzerland’s central bank, raising turmoil in the markets in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The Swiss bank announced it would borrow from the Swiss National Bank late Wednesday, after its shares plunged on its disclosure that it had uncovered “material weaknesses” relating to its financial reporting. The Dow Jones industrial average fell by almost 1 percent Wednesday and European banking stocks tumbled, contributing to a 3 percent fall in the Pan-European Stoxx 600 index.

Compounding Credit Suisse’s problems, the bank’s largest investor, Saudi National Bank, signaled Wednesday that it would not be rushing in with more cash to help buttress the firm.

Credit Suisse has struggled with a host of problems for years, and its latest troubles differ from those that brought down SVB. But the Swiss bank is much larger and more integrated with the global financial system, and its problems come amid growing worries about bank stability globally.

“Credit Suisse is in principle a much bigger concern for the global economy than the regional U.S. banks which were in the firing line last week,” Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist with Capital Economics, said in a research note Wednesday. “Credit Suisse is not just a Swiss problem but a global one.”

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) and the country’s main financial regulator, known as FINMA, issued a joint statement late Wednesday saying that Credit Suisse “meets the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks.”

But “if necessary, the SNB will provide CS with liquidity,” the statement said.

Hours later, Credit Suisse said it would borrow from the Swiss central bank to “support Credit Suisse’s core businesses and clients.” It added that it would buy back up to $3 billion worth of debt.

Market jitters also continued to spark gyrations in bond trading Wednesday, causing an index measuring volatility in those markets to surge.

U.S. federal officials are trying to evaluate the extent to which U.S. banks may be vulnerable to a decline in Credit Suisse’s value, according to two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal talks. That review was first reported by Bloomberg.

The Treasury Department declined to comment, although a spokeswoman confirmed in a statement that Treasury is monitoring the situation and is in touch with global counterparts. In addition to the risk posed by U.S. bank holdings of Credit Suisse’s stock, the Swiss bank has subsidiaries in the United States that fall under federal oversight and could pose financial risks.

The new questions around Credit Suisse’s financial stability could factor into the European Central Bank’s decision, scheduled for Thursday, about whether to raise interest rates.

In its annual report released Tuesday, the Swiss bank said it found “material weaknesses” relating to the bank’s “failure” to appropriately identify the risk of misstatements in its financial reporting. It added that it had failed to maintain effective monitoring over the bank’s “internal control objectives” and “risk assessment and monitoring objectives.”

The bank added that it did not “maintain effective controls over the classification and presentation of the consolidated statement of cash flows.”

Credit Suisse said it is working to address its problems, which could require it to “expend significant resources.” It cautioned that the troubles could ultimately impact the bank’s access to capital markets and subject it to regulatory investigations and sanctions.

The Swiss bank had delayed releasing its annual report after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked for more information last week about past cash flow statements.

The bank previously has disclosed that it suffered significant customer withdrawals in October. It repeated that information in its annual report, saying “significant deposit and net asset outflows in the fourth quarter” undermined the bank’s full-year financial results. In December, bank Chairman Axel Lehmann told Bloomberg that the outflows “basically have stopped” and that some client money was returning, particularly in Switzerland.

If the Swiss bank were “to enter a really disorderly phase, that would be a big event,” said French economist Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at the think tank Bruegel and at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “Having said that, it was already perceived as troubled for some time. I expect that fact to have been factored into the strategies of market participants. So I imagine the risk won’t be borne by well-regulated institutions.”

The U.S. economy has appeared to be on strong footing in recent months, with the labor market remaining strong and inflation showing signs that it had begun to cool. But the outlook darkened Friday when Silicon Valley Bank suddenly failed, marking the second-biggest bank failure in U.S. history. The bank, which works with tech clients, got into trouble when its large holdings in U.S. government bonds fell in value as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. Concerns about SVB’s health then sparked a run on deposits.

Financial stocks have been shaky ever since, and on Sunday regulators shuttered Signature Bank of New York. To stave off a broader panic, U.S. authorities stepped in to assure depositors at the failed banks they would not lose their money. Regional U.S. bank stocks fell sharply Monday and then rebounded Tuesday. But the Credit Suisse news Wednesday, a sign that banking-sector issues aren’t confined to U.S. banks, has rattled investors again.

Shares of First Republic Bank, another Bay Area bank catering to tech clients, dropped more than 16 percent, but rose again in after-hours market trading. Volatility spread across the market — the CBOE VIX index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” was up more than 10 percent.

The 167-year-old Credit Suisse was founded to finance the expansion of the Swiss railroads. Today it focuses on banking services for wealthy clients, as well as asset management and investment banking.

Unlike Lehman Brothers, which collapsed suddenly in 2008 as people recognized the size of its off-book liabilities and businesses, Credit Suisse’s troubles have built over time as the bank has struggled with financial losses, risk and compliance problems, as well as a high-profile data breach. In recent years it suffered big losses from its relationships with the collapsed hedge fund Archegos and a failed financial firm called Greensill Capital.

The Swiss bank has been attempting to restructure its business for months, aiming to scale back its investment-banking business and moving money toward global wealth management, according to Fitch Ratings.

Kenningham, the economist, said it was unclear how far the Swiss bank’s troubles could spread.

“The problems in Credit Suisse once more raise the question whether this is the beginning of a global crisis or just another ‘idiosyncratic’ case,” he wrote. “Credit Suisse was widely seen as the weakest link among Europe’s large banks, but it is not the only bank which has struggled with weak profitability in recent years. Moreover, this is the third ‘one-off’ problem in a few months … so it would be foolish to assume there will be no other problems coming down the road.”

Just two months ago, David Herro, chief investment officer of Harris Associates, said the Chicago-based investment firm planned to stick with its stake in Credit Suisse. The Swiss bank’s new chief executive, Ulrich Körner, was “very capable,” Herro said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “He’s the exact answer to their problems.”

But Herro added that he was losing patience. Ten days ago, Harris Associates sold its remaining shares.

The new market volatility could accelerate the U.S. recession that many analysts have predicted is looming, Deutsche Bank chief U.S. economist Matthew Luzzetti said Wednesday.

Previously, Luzzetti had forecast that the United States would enter a recession as soon as the end of this year. He now has a “higher conviction” in that forecast, he told The Washington Post.

“We’re a few days into seeing this volatility, and being able to see how this plays out is impossible at this point.”

The White House scrambled over the weekend to calm customers and the banking industry, moving swiftly in an effort to avert a sense of crisis. In Silicon Valley, start-up founders who kept their money at Silicon Valley Bank fretted over how they would pay their employees before breathing a sigh of relief when they learned they’d have access to their full accounts.

But SVB and Signature’s closures still sent a sense of precariousness through the banking sector. When Credit Suisse issued its annual report that found that its “disclosure controls and procedures were not effective” during a certain time period, it was into a market that was already on edge.

Credit Suisse’s largest investor, Saudi National Bank, which owns 9.88 percent of the Swiss institution, said it would not take a larger stake.

“The answer is absolutely not, for many reasons outside the simplest reason, which is regulatory and statutory,” Chairman Ammar Al Khudairy told Bloomberg TV.

Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund is another large investor in Credit Suisse, with a 6.8 percent stake.

The Swiss bank's plunged as low as $1.88 per share on Wednesday afternoon – a 25% drop from the previous day's close — after Credit Suisse's top shareholder, Saudi National Bank, ruled out increasing its stake in the bank due to limitations imposed by regulators from the various jurisdictions overseeing its investment.

""If we go above [a] 10% [stake], all new rules kick in whether it be by our regulator or the Swiss regulator or the European regulator,"" Saudi National Bank Chairman Ammar Al Khudairy told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. ""We're not inclined to get into a new regulatory regime.""

On Wednesday, the Swiss National Bank announced that it would backstop Credit Suisse if needed, but stressed that the bank ""meets the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks,"" giving Credit Suisse shares a boost in after-hours trading.

Credit Suisse later announced in a statement that it would ""exercise its option"" to borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs (about $53.6 billion) from the Swiss National Bank in an effort to ""pre-emptively strengthen its liquidity.""

A former senior official at the Federal Reserve expressed confidence in Switzerland's ability to handle the fallout.

""The Swiss have enough firepower and resources to arrange something so that this wouldn't be a systemic event,"" the official said.

""Material weaknesses"" in financial reports



The previous day, Credit Suisse rattled investors by disclosing that it had discovered ""material weaknesses"" in its 2021 and 2022 financial reports.

""[Credit Suisse] Group's internal control over financial reporting was not effective as it did not design and maintain an effective risk assessment process to identify and analyze the risk of material misstatements in its financial statements,"" the bank said in its annual report, released Tuesday.

Concerns over the accuracy of Credit Suisse's financial reporting and its relationship with investors came under scrutiny after the meltdowns of Greensill Capital and Archegos Capital Management, which battered the bank in 2021, causing it to lose billions of dollars.

Credit Suisse racked up $8 billion in net losses in 2022, its largest ever annual losses, according to the bank's filings. Credit Suisse's wealth management unit also posted roughly $133 billion in net asset outflows for 2022 as customers took their business elsewhere, SEC filings show.

""Much bigger concern""

Those financial woes, along with the recent collapse of tech-focused Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, likely intensified the market's reaction to statements Wednesday by the bank's top investor, said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist with Capital Economics.

""Credit Suisse has been a slowing moving car crash for years, it seems, but now today's news of course is happening in the vortex of SVB,"" he told investors in a report.

Kenningham described Credit Suisse's struggles as a ""much bigger concern for the global economy"" than the health of regional U.S. banks like SVB. The Swiss company, which has a much larger balance sheet than SVB, is categorized by financial regulators as a ""global systemically important bank"" and is deeply interconnected with financial entities, including subsidiaries in the U.S.

""[T]he problems in Credit Suisse once more raise the question whether this is the beginning of a global crisis or just another 'idiosyncratic' case,"" he wrote. ""Credit Suisse was widely seen as the weakest link among Europe's large banks, but it is not the only bank which has struggled with weak profitability in recent years.""

As the selloff in Credit Suisse shares fuels concerns about the global banking system, the broader markets have also retreated. The S&P 500 fell 0.7% on Wednesday, while the KBW Bank Index, which measures the performance of 24 national and regional banks, declined 3.5%.

Shares of embattled Swiss bank Credit Suisse fell to a record low Tuesday after a report that regulators are reviewing comments the lender’s chairman made about the health of its finances.

The bank’s stock plunged as much as 9% to trade at 2.52 Swiss francs ($2.73), before recovering slightly.

Earlier in the day, Reuters, citing two people with knowledge of the matter, reported that Switzerland’s financial regulator was seeking to establish the extent to which Axel Lehmann, and other bank representatives, were aware that clients were still withdrawing funds when he told reporters that outflows had stopped.

Lehmann made the remarks in interviews on December 1 and December 2, Reuters said. On December 2, the bank’s stock jumped by 9.3%. Lehmann may not have been briefed correctly before he made those comments, according to one of the people quoted by Reuters.

Credit Suisse told CNN Tuesday: “We do not comment on speculation.” The Swiss financial regulator, Finma, declined to comment.

The latest cloud to emerge over Credit Suisse (CS) follows news earlier this month that the bank had suffered its biggest annual loss since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008. Credit Suisse (CS) said customers had withdrawn 111 billion Swiss francs ($120 billion) in the final quarter of 2022, when the bank was hit by social media speculation that it was on the brink of collapse.

The rumors, which sparked a selloff in the lender’s shares, followed a series of missteps and compliance failures that cost Credit Suisse billions.

The bank is now in the middle of a major restructuring plan that entails cutting 9,000 full-time jobs, spinning off its investment bank and focusing on wealth management. It expects to make another substantial loss in 2023.

Now that they're merging, I can say that categorically that one is better than the other. And it's not UBS.

Credit Suisse was the best place I ever worked. When I was at the bank a few years ago, it was truly entrepreneurial and the energy and the drive on the floor were amazing. This is why so many ex-Credit Suisse people are sad about what's happened. Credit Suisse was a really nice employer. Although the Credit Suisse culture is much maligned, the bank really wasn't that bad and a lot of the staff there were of very high calibre.

UBS is completely different. It's not a bad place to work, but the culture is completely different. While Credit Suisse had an entrepreneurial and almost American investment banking spirit (if you had good ideas and innovation you could drive things forward), UBS was/is a tank.

When you work for UBS have to function like you're in an army. The spirit at UBS (at least in the fixed income sales and trading business) is much stiffer and more uptight. UBS was rescued in the financial crisis and is still paranoid about getting things wrong. Innovation is not encouraged.

This is why a lot of Credit Suisse veterans who join UBS don't much like it. In fixed income sales and trading especially, Credit Suisse was by far the better bank with solid markets DNA.

The problems at Credit Suisse stemmed from Tidjane Thiam's amateur restructuring efforts and closure and crimping of vital teams. A lot of Credit Suisse veterans moved to UBS a few years ago for this reason. Not many of them stayed.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/credit-suisse-stocks-down-banks-2023-03-15/,Stocks slump as Credit Suisse selloff reignites bank worries,"Stocks fell on Wednesday amid fresh worries about the banking sector, although Wall Street more than halved its losses by the closing bell.

The S&P 500 closed with a decline of 27 points, or 0.7%, at 3,892. The Dow posted a slightly steeper drop of 281, or 0.9%, at 31,875, while the Nasdaq rose slightly thanks to late gains in tech shares. Treasury yields plunged following several reports on the economy that were weaker than expected.

Switzerland's Credit Suisse sparked a broad selloff early Wednesday after its shares fell to a new low. Markets pared some of their losses as the Swiss National Bank said it could provide some assistance to Credit Suisse if needed.

Credit Suisse later announced in a statement that it would ""exercise its option"" to borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs (about $53.6 billion) from the Swiss National Bank in an effort to ""pre-emptively strengthen its liquidity.""

The Switzerland-based Wall Street bank tanked following reports that its top shareholder will no longer pump more money into the struggling firm. Saudi National Bank representatives said they could not shore up their investments in Credit Suisse, citing regulatory concerns.

The banking giant in February reported a fourth-quarter loss of $1.6 billion, after clients pulled $88.3 billion from the bank in the first two weeks of October, fearing instability after a year of scandal and restructuring, Bloomberg reported. Its loss for the year totaled $7.9 billion, its largest annual loss since the 2008 financial crisis, reported CNN.

Global problem

""Credit Suisse is not just a Swiss problem but a global one,"" Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics said in a research note.

""The problems in Credit Suisse once more raise the question whether this is the beginning of a global crisis or just another 'idiosyncratic' case,"" he said, noting that ""it is not the only bank which has struggled with weak profitability in recent years."" Given that, plus the regional bank failures in the U.S.,""it would be foolish to assume there will be no other problems coming down the road,"" Kenningham said.

Indeed, the three recent bank failures in the U.S. have investors on edge, and the Credit Suisse news prompted renewed selling in bank stocks both in the U.S. and Europe.

""The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the USA represents the biggest threat to the financial system since the global financial crisis,"" Evghenia Sleptsova, senior EM economist at Oxford Economics said in a research note. ""Although SVB was only the 16th largest U.S. bank, it is being viewed by the markets as potentially symptomatic of similar problems at other banks globally, many of whom hold large portfolios of long-dated securities, which could incur heavy losses if sold before maturity.""

""Vortex of negativity""

Confidence in the banking system has eroded in just a matter of days following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday and Signature Bank on Sunday.

""The whole Credit Suisse incident Wed morning makes clear just how unique an industry banks are, with the entire business model dependent on the faith of financial markets,"" analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge said in a report. ""If people THINK there's a problem, there WILL be a problem.""

Impaired confidence in the banking system in the U.S. and Europe leaves more scrutinized lending institutions like Credit Suisse ""especially vulnerable to tipping down into a vortex of negativity,"" Crisafulli warns, regardless of the stability of the firm in reality.

""For Credit Suisse specifically, all that happened this morning was the head of its largest shareholder ruled out further equity injections for REGULATORY reasons (not due to concerns about the soundness of the institution),"" he noted.

For banks and regulators, said Crisafulli, finding ways to boosting investor confidence is key to breaking

""the feedback loop of gloom.""

Selloff hits mostly regional banks

Most of the premarket decliners in the S&P 500 early Wednesday were regional banks, with Zion Bancorp, KeyCorp, Commerce and Regions all sliding between 5% and 8%. Bigger banks also lost ground, with Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup all fell between 3% and 4%.

Banks have struggled for the better part of the year as higher interest rates has fewer people and businesses taking out loans, part of the Federal Reserve's goal as it tries to cool the economy and bring down four-decade high inflation.

Investors returned to the bond market Wednesday, sending yields lower again after they recovered somewhat the previous day. The 2-year yield fell back down to 4.05% from 4.25% late Tuesday, and the yield on the 10-year slid to 3.53% from 3.69%.

Stocks had rallied Tuesday after the government said consumer prices decelerated from the previous month, mostly in line with analysts' expectations. The data showed core inflation, with volatile energy and food prices stripped out to show a clearer trend, was 0.5% in February over the previous month, edging up from January's 0.4% gain. The Fed pays close attention to core inflation in deciding on monetary policy.

Investors fear Fed overreaction

Investors fear the Fed might respond to enduring upward pressure on prices by speeding up the pace of interest rate increases to dampen economic activity and inflation.

The Fed faces a dilemma over how to respond when banks already are under strain after the fastest pace of rate hikes in a decade knocked down prices of their assets.

""The Fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments.

""Inflation met expectations, but couple it with a stern warning that if inflation trends don't improve that they might need to hike more.""

He said the Fed also has other tools to use besides rate increases. Among them: The Fed could adjust the speed at which it's shrinking its massive trove of bond investments, an action that effectively tightens the screws on the financial system.

President Biden and regulators have tried to assure the public that risks are contained and deposits in other banks are safe.

Later Wednesday, the government reports on retail sales, giving the Fed more data to chew on before its meeting next week where the central bank will decide whether or not to raise its main borrowing rate for the ninth time in a row.

The deal will trigger a “complete write-down” of the bank’s additional tier 1 bonds in order to increase core capital, Swiss financial regulator FINMA said in a statement on its website. Meanwhile, the bank’s shareholders are set to receive 3 billion francs.

The bond wipe out is the biggest loss yet for Europe’s $275 billion AT1 market, far eclipsing the only other write-down to date of this type of security: a €1.35 billion ($1.44 billion) loss suffered by junior bondholders of Spanish lender Banco Popular SA back in 2017, when it was absorbed by Banco Santander SA for one euro to avoid a collapse. In that instance, the equity was also written off.

In a typical writedown scenario, shareholders are the first to take a hit before AT1 bonds face losses, as Credit Suisse also guided in a presentation to investors earlier this week. That’s why the decision to write down the bank’s riskiest debt — rather than its shareholders — provoked a furious response from some of Credit Suisse’s AT1 bondholders.

“This just makes no sense,” said Patrik Kauffmann, a portfolio manager at Aquila Asset Management AG. “This will be a total blow to the AT1 market. You can quote me on that.”

Kauffmann believes that money should have gone to AT1 holders instead, leaving nothing for shareholders, as “seniority in the capital structure need to be respected.”

AT1 bondholders

Pacific Investment Management Co., Invesco Ltd. and BlueBay Funds Management Co. SA were among the many asset managers holding Credit Suisse AT1 notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Their holdings may have changed or been sold entirely since their last regulatory filings.

Pimco and BlueBay declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News on Friday, before the deal was announced. A spokeswoman for Invesco said that its investment teams are continuing to monitor developments.

AT1 bonds were introduced in Europe after the global financial crisis to serve as shock absorbers when banks start to fail. They are designed to impose permanent losses on bondholders or be converted into equity if a bank’s capital ratios fall below a predetermined level, effectively propping up its balance sheet and allowing it to stay in business.

Prices on those bonds fluctuated wildly as traders gathered for a rare weekend session on Sunday to weigh two scenarios: either the regulator would nationalize part or the whole bank, possibly writing off Credit Suisse’s AT1 bonds entirely, or a UBS buyout with potentially no losses for bondholders.

Prices oscillated between 20 cents on the dollar to as high as 70 cents when the deal was finalized. Following the FINMA announcement, some trading desks simply updated their clients that a write-down had occurred.

The broader market for those risky European bank bonds, also known as contingent convertibles or CoCos, has also tumbled in the past two weeks, with the average AT1 indicated at a price of about 80% of face value on Friday, one of the steepest discounts on record.

Hand grenades

For some investors, the fact the UBS deal rendered the notes worthless came as no surprise, given their well-known downsides.

Holders of AT1s knew they were buying high-yield risk with a hand grenade attached to it, according to John McClain, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management.

“It’s absolutely the right thing to do to prevent moral hazard from creeping into that part of the market,” he said. “Those bonds were created for moments like this. Similar to catastrophe bonds.”",['Tasos Vossos Colin Keatinge Bloomberg'],2023-03-19 00:00:00

What Went Wrong?,"Switzerland’s role as banker to the world’s rich was built on a reputation for institutional discretion and dull reliability. That only made the scandals, public legal battles and mounting losses at Credit Suisse Group AG more striking and hard to comprehend. In March, a slow-burn crisis turned into full-blown panic, clients ran for the door and the Swiss government swooped in to arrange a hasty takeover by local rival UBS Group AG. Thus an icon of Swiss financial prowess that was established in the mid-19th century and rose to become one of the world’s 30 systemically important lenders was no more.

Credit Suisse’s failings included a criminal conviction for allowing drug dealers to launder money in Bulgaria, entanglement in a Mozambique corruption case, a spying scandal involving a former employee and an executive and a massive leak of client data to the media. Its willingness to engage with clients that some other banks avoided, such as disgraced financier Lex Greensill and failed New York-based investment firm Archegos Capital Management, lost it billions of dollars and compounded the sense of an institution that didn’t have a firm grip on its affairs. Many fed up customers voted with their feet, leading to unprecedented client outflows in late 2022.

UBS shares staged a remarkable rally Monday afternoon, reversing steep losses after the bank's 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.2 billion) ""emergency rescue"" of embattled domestic rival Credit Suisse .

Shares of UBS closed 1.2% higher, recovering from losses of over 14% at one point in the session. Credit Suisse, meanwhile, closed more than 55% lower.

Europe's banking index rose 1.2% by the end of the session, recouping earlier losses as a sense of calm appeared to return to markets.

The volatility comes shortly after UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse as part of a cut-price deal in an effort to stem the risk of contagion to the global banking system.

Swiss authorities and regulators helped to facilitate the deal, announced Sunday, as Credit Suisse teetered on the brink.

The size of Credit Suisse was a concern for the banking system, as was its global footprint given its multiple international subsidiaries.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/14/investing/credit-suisse-financial-reporting-weakness/index.html,"Credit Suisse finds ‘material weakness’ in its financial reporting, scraps exec bonuses","London CNN —

Credit Suisse acknowledged “material weakness” in its financial reporting Tuesday as it scrapped bonuses for top executives in the wake of the bank’s worst annual performance since the global financial crisis.

The embattled Swiss lender also said chairman Axel Lehmann had proposed to “voluntarily waive” a share award worth 1.5 million Swiss francs ($1.6 million) for the 2022-2023 financial year, given the firm’s “poor financial performance.”

Credit Suisse (CSGKF) said in its annual report that it had found “the group’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective” because it failed to adequately identify potential risks to financial statements.

The revelations come just days after the bank delayed the publication of the annual report after an eleventh-hour query from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over cash flow statements for 2019 and 2020.

The board concluded that the “material weakness could result in misstatements of account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual financial statements of Credit Suisse,” the annual report said. Credit Suisse is urgently developing a “remediation plan” to strengthen controls.

The bank’s stock fell more than 3% but recovered as European markets steadied to trade up 0.7% by 9 a.m. ET. It had fallen to a new record low Monday, as the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the United States scared investors and pummeled banking stocks around the world.

Outflows continue

Customers withdrew billions from Credit Suisse last year, contributing to the bank’s biggest annual loss since the financial crisis in 2008. The stock has plunged 67% over the past 12 months.

The health of the bank’s finances is once again under the microscope following the demise of SVB and spillover effects on global financial markets.

Despite the fallout from SVB’s collapse, Credit Suisse saw “material good inflows” Monday, according to CEO Ulrich Körner.

“So far it’s calm,” he said in an interview on Bloomberg TV Tuesday. Outflows from the bank had “significantly moderated” after customers withdrew 111 billion francs ($122 billion) in the three months to December, Körner added. The annual report painted a similar picture, saying outflows had not yet reversed by the end of last year.

Körner said the collapse of SVB was “somewhat of an isolated problem.” Credit Suisse follows “materially different and higher standards when it comes to capital funding, liquidity and so on,” he added.

Exec bonuses scrapped

In a separate compensation report, Credit Suisse said it had cut its employee bonus pool in half last year compared with 2021, setting aside 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.1 million).

Executive board members took home 32.2 million francs ($35.3 million) in fixed compensation but received no bonuses.

Once a big player on Wall Street, Credit Suisse has been hit by a series of missteps and compliance failures over the past few years that have damaged its reputation and profit, as well as cost several top executives their jobs.

In October, the lender embarked on a “radical” restructuring plan that entails cutting 9,000 full-time jobs, spinning off its investment bank and focusing on wealth management.

Körner said Tuesday the bank had the “right plan” in place and it was executing on it “at pace.”

“Nobody is pleased about the share price development…I can’t manage the share price, I can manage the execution and I do,” he added.",['Hanna Ziady'],2023-03-14 00:00:00

The upper house gave its green light earlier in the day.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Lawmakers from both sides of the political spectrum again lined up to blame the government, regulators and the bank’s management for failures around the takeover last month. Two hours into the debate in the lower house, it wasn’t clear if a vote on the guarantees would be held Tuesday night.

Damien Cottier, an MP with the Liberal-Radicals, called the day the deal was struck a “day of shame” for Switzerland before going on to call it the “least-bad and least risky” option.

Cottier’s tone reflects that of many frustrated lawmakers who are critical — and in an election year want to be seen as being so — of the banks and the government while at the same time are wary of trying to block the deal. Though parliament doesn’t have the power to derail the takeover, the extraordinary session has forced the government to once again defend the unpopular emergency takeover by UBS Group AG announced on March 19.

In that vein, Swiss President Alain Berset opened the lower-house debate after 7pm local time by saying Credit Suisse’s “negative spiral” spurred his government into action. Temporary nationalisation, a forced bankruptcy and orderly wind-down of the bank were all considered but rejected in favor of the UBS takeover, he said.

The government, Swiss National Bank and Swiss banking regulator Finma “acted in a decisive manner to restore confidence,” Berset said.

Story continues

Earlier in the day, more than a dozen lawmakers in the upper house voiced their grievances. Their concerns varied from being circumvented in the emergency legislation, to regulatory lapses that allowed Credit Suisse’s failings to go un-addressed, to demanding accountability for the bank’s management.

“The legal possibilities against the bankers responsible and the possibilities to claw back bonuses need to be exhausted to the fullest extent,” said the president of the Free Democrats Thierry Burkart.

Some legislators called for greater powers for the financial regulator, Finma, amid a broader review of too-big-to-fail rules for the sector, while others asked for a parliamentary inquiry commission. Quick legislative changes are unlikely though, as became apparent during the debate.

The deal — described by Berset earlier as the best option to re-establish confidence in markets — created a banking giant whose assets are more than twice the size of the Swiss economy.

Job Cuts

Politicians and business leaders have voiced worries that the combined lender will have excessive market power, leading to a loss of competition. Despite the risks involved in integrating Credit Suisse, UBS stands to become a banking “powerhouse” post merger, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in a note Tuesday.

UBS, already one of the world’s largest wealth managers, is now taking over a key rival for a fraction of the value of its assets and receiving as much as 9 billion Swiss francs in government loss guarantees.

Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter made clear that if these guarantees turned out to be not enough, it would be up to parliament to decide on an extension. The government and UBS agreed on the lender taking on the first 5 billion francs in potential losses, before the administration steps in for the next 9 billion.

Before the takeover, Credit Suisse had already planned to cut as many as 9,000 jobs worldwide over the coming years. The overlaps between the two banks’ businesses will likely lead to that number rising, though executives including UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher have said that it’s too early to say how big the cuts will be.

‘Finma Failed’

Finma didn’t move in time, said Heidi Z’graggen, upper-house member of the Center Alliance.

“Finma’s job is to protect shareholder rights and ensure functioning of the financial center,” she said. “At this, Finma failed.”

A parliamentary inquiry commission is necessary to answer whether the financial regulator, the Swiss National Bank and the finance ministry reacted properly, she said. Such a body would have subpoena powers to summon witnesses.

Given the merger has been met with little public enthusiasm, parliament is also trying to curtail government powers in the future: They are attempting to block the use of emergency measures to push through deals like this.

Corporate Switzerland’s darkest hour since the national airline collapsed two decades ago has given parties on the left and right the scent of an opportunity before October elections.This week’s showdown in parliament offered a glimpse of their playbook. Building on public discontent over the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG by UBS Group AG, the right-wing Swiss People’s Party and left-wing Social Democrats joined the Greens in voting down a bill to provide 109 billion francs ($120 billion) in government guarantees.That rejection was symbolic — given the money had been already granted — but it highlights the risk of a populist turn in a country whose executive is traditionally driven by pragmatism. Criticism of the shotgun bank rescue by governing parties also threatens to further dent Switzerland’s battered reputation as a haven of stability.“This will influence public discourse and will harm the open, business-friendly climate in Switzerland,” said Michael Hermann, head of the Zurich-based research institute Sotomo.Both the Swiss People’s Party and the Social Democrats have sought to distance themselves from a deal widely perceived as toxic.“Once again, taxpayers have to bail out a major Swiss bank,” the People’s Party said in a April 11 statement, bemoaning the failure of the Federal Council.Like the Social Democrats, the People’s Party has two seats in Switzerland’s governing seven-member executive.“They play this card very cynically, especially the People’s Party because normally they support big banks,” said Rene Schwok, director of the Global Studies Institute at the University of Geneva. “This is very Swiss because we all accept it: you can belong to government, but can then criticize it.”Over half of the Swiss population disapproves of the deal and all major parties have a credibility deficit, according to a snap poll after the takeover. More than four in five Swiss also want to see UBS spin off Credit Suisse’s domestic bank to ensure healthy competition in retail banking.“I don’t see any party profiting from the Credit Suisse issue,” said George Lutz, director of research center FORS and professor for political science at Lausanne University. “In fact , I perceived all parties primarily as helpless.”Perhaps the party with most at stake is the Greens, whose breakthrough performance in 2019 followed a campaign that tapped into concern about extreme summer heat and melting Alpine glaciers.With those issues eclipsed by a cost-of-living crisis and the war in Ukraine, the party is seeking to revive its flagging fortunes — and gain a seat on the Federal Council for the first time — by criticizing the bank rescue.“If climate was a bank, the government would already have saved it,” Green lawmaker Balthasar Glaettli said this week.Typically in national elections, not many seats change hands, with the main political blocs in Switzerland remaining stable over the past 100 years, according to Lutz of Lausanne University. The contentious banking takeover could also fade from view by October, unless UBS shows early signs of cashing in on its ownership of Credit Suisse, he said.While public discontent may temporarily squeeze parties of the center-right — such as Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter’s FDP — the reverberations from Credit Suisse’s collapse are likely to be less profound than those that followed the grounding of national carrier Swissair in 2001.“The collapse of Swissair was a much larger and more passionate discussion,” said Schwok.",[],
https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ubs-take-over-credit-suisse-central-bank-2023-03-19/,"UBS to take over Credit Suisse, assume up to 5 billion Swiss francs in losses","













BERN, March 19 (Reuters) - UBS (UBSG.S) agreed to buy rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.23 billion) in stock and agreed to assume up to 5 billion francs ($5.4 billion) in losses, in a shotgun merger engineered by Swiss authorities to avoid more market-shaking turmoil in global banking.

The deal includes 100 billion Swiss francs ($108 billion) in liquidity assistance for UBS and Credit Suisse from the Swiss central bank.

To enable UBS to take over Credit Suisse, the federal government is providing a loss guarantee of a maximum of 9 billion Swiss francs for a clearly defined part of the portfolio, the government said.

This will be activated if losses are actually incurred on this portfolio. In that eventuality, UBS would assume the first 5 billion francs, the federal government the next 9 billion francs, and UBS would assume any further losses, the government said.

Switzerland's regulator FINMA said that there was a risk that Credit Suisse could have become ""illiquid, even if it remained solvent, and it was necessary for the authorities to take action"".

Credit Suisse Additional Tier 1 shares with a nominal value of around 16 billion francs ($17.2 billion) will be written down completely after the Swiss government provided support for UBS' takeover of Credit Suisse, FINMA said.

The 167-year-old Credit Suisse has been the biggest name ensnared in market turmoil unleashed by the recent collapse of U.S. lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, forcing it to tap $54 billion in central bank funding last week.

""With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,"" the Swiss central bank said.

Authorities had been scrambling to rescue Credit Suisse, among the world's largest wealth managers, before financial markets reopened on Monday.

UBS and Credit Suisse are both in a group of the 30 global systemically important banks watched closely by regulators, and Credit Suisse's failure would ripple throughout the entire financial system.

The announcement came in a make-or-break weekend after some rivals grew cautious in their dealings with the struggling Swiss lender, and its regulators urged it to pursue a deal with UBS.

FINMA, which said it had approved the takeover, said recent measures to stabilize itself were ""not enough to restore confidence in the bank, however, and more far-reaching options were also examined.""

The two banks' fortunes have diverged sharply over the past year. UBS earned $7.6 billion in profit in 2022, while Credit Suisse lost $7.9 billion. Credit Suisse's shares are down 74% from a year ago, while UBS's are relatively flat.

Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics

The Swiss government said that it was also giving UBS a guarantee of 9 billion Swiss francs ""assume potential losses"" from assets as part of the transaction.

UBS's chief executive officer Ralph Hamers and Chairman Colm Kelleher will remain at the helm of the combined bank.

""The transaction reinforces UBS's position as the leading universal bank in Switzerland,"" UBS said.

Executives foreshadowed structural changes in the offing.

Kelleher said it would wrap up running Credit Suisse's investment bank, but added that it was too early to say anything about potential job cuts.

Kelleher also said they would keep Credit Suisse's domestic business, despite speculation that it could be spun off amid competition concerns.

Credit Suisse's Chairman Axel Lehmann called the merger the ""best available outcome"".

UBS said in a statement that the total price is 3 billion Swiss francs, or about $3.25 billion, in UBS shares.

The deal was pushed through in an effort to avoid further turmoil in global banking following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and another regional lender in the U.S.

“With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,” the Swiss National Bank said in a separate statement, noting that the deal was made possible with the support of the Swiss federal government, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA and the Swiss National Bank.

The central bank added that UBS and Credit Suisse can obtain a liquidity assistance loan of up to 100 billion francs.

Highlighting the urgency of securing a deal for the bank before markets open on Monday, Swiss authorities adjusted laws to allow further provision of liquidity by the Swiss central bank, while the government agreed to provide additional guarantees.

The expeditious rescue of Credit Suisse was welcomed by the European Central Bank as well as the Federal Reserve in the U.S.

The ""swift action"" by the Swiss authorities ""are instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said in a statement.

The 167-year-old Credit Suisse has been involved in a series of scandals that have undermined the confidence of investors and clients.

https://fortune.com/2023/03/06/credit-suisse-harris-associates-david-herro-liquidated-stake/,Credit Suisse future in question as big investor bails,"Fed up with a never-ending string of ugly headlines and poor quarterly results, Credit Suisse’s most stalwart investor for the past two decades has abandoned the scandal-plagued bank.

Harris Associates’ David Herro, who owned a tenth of the Zurich-based financial institute as recently as last year, revealed on Sunday that he began reducing his holdings in October before finally liquidating everything after his patience ran out.

Speaking to the Financial Times, the firm’s chief investment officer explained in brutal terms what little faith he still had left in the bank’s management.

“There is a question about the future of the franchise,” said Herro, citing the 111 billion Swiss francs ($119 billion) in assets drained from its wealth management business, the bank’s cash cow, during the final quarter of last year.

Money managers tend not to have very long investment horizons, which makes Herro a rarity in the industry. With one brief exception between 2008 and 2009, he stuck by the bank through thick and thin ever since he first took a large position two decades ago.

However, Credit Suisse has sapped market confidence following numerous self-inflicted wounds. These include a $5.5 billion exposure to imploded hedge fund Archegos, and selling an investment fund stuffed with assets originated and packaged by bankrupt firm Greensill Capital that could cost clients an estimated $2.6 billion in losses at last count.

The financial institute is currently on its third pair of chief executive and board chair in just three years. The latest CEO, Ulrich Körner, joined the ranks of his predecessors when he unveiled yet another strategic restructuring plan last October.

Last month he was forced to reveal that the bank’s annual net loss attributable to shareholders reached its highest since 2008, ballooning to 7.3 billion francs from a 1.7 billion loss in the previous year.

On Monday, Herro said his company had “lots of other options” for investing its clients’ funds now that rising interest rates are buoying a lot of European peers.

“Why go for something that is burning capital when the rest of the sector is now generating it,” he continued, citing other investments in peers like Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo or BNP Paribas of France, among others.

Bank counters it is ‘laser focused’ on implementing its latest restructuring plan

While Credit Suisse was hit by rumors at the start of October that it faced a “Lehman moment”—catalyst for the exodus of client capital to which Herro referred—other banks were recovering from earlier troubles.

Last month, ailing German lender Commerzbank posted its highest annual net profit since 2007 thanks to rising net interest income.

Herro also criticized what he felt were unfavorable terms with the carve-out of investment banking arm, Credit Suisse First Boston, and the sale of its securitized products business to a private equity group.

“We feel the plan to restructure the investment bank, while a noble cause, is cumbersome and far more costly in terms of cash burn than we expected,” Herro said. “We were also not satisfied with what we were getting in terms of proceeds…from the sale of securitised products.”

When contacted by Fortune, Credit Suisse defended its decisions as following “clear strategic objectives” and argued its latest plan was being implemented faster than initially scheduled.

“We are laser focused on successfully executing our plan and on progressing toward our targets to ensure new Credit Suisse delivers sustainable value for all our stakeholders,” it said in a written statement on Monday.

Credit Suisse’s results, while poor, did not dissuade other value investors speculating the stock’s recent plunge offered an attractive entry point from a risk-reward perspective. Saudi National Bank, for example, acquired a 10% stake in the Zurich lender for roughly 1.8 billion francs towards the end of last year.

Together with a 2.2-billion-franc rights issue in the fourth quarter, the lender was able to plug a hole in its balance sheet blown wide open after booking a 3.7-billion-franc charge to write down the value of tax losses it once aimed to carry forward.

To backstop the emergency sale of Credit Suisse Group AG to its Zurich rival UBS Group AG, the Swiss government pledged to make as much as 109 billion francs available — a hefty burden for the country of 8.7 million people.

On top of that, there’s a guarantee from the Swiss National Bank of 100 billion francs that isn’t backed by a government guarantee, according to the deal announced Sunday evening.

The combined sum of 209 billion francs is equivalent to about a quarter of Switzerland’s gross domestic product and exceeds total European defense spending in 2021. The price tag for Switzerland’s largest ever corporate rescue could add up to more than three times the 60 billion-franc bailout of UBS in 2008.

The renewed rescue for well-paid bankers sparked protests. About 200 people gathered outside Credit Suisse’s headquarters in Zurich on Monday, chanting “eat the rich” and throwing eggs at the building at the heart of the city’s financial district.

“We are fed up with the idea that if you are big enough, you get everything,” said Christoph Rechsteiner, a partner at the Zurich-based tax consultancy MME. “The law is changed for you over a weekend.”

On top of the financial guarantees, the Swiss government agreed to change legislation that bypasses shareholder approval and the country’s financial regulator wiped out about 16 billion francs worth of Credit Suisse bonds to increase the bank’s core capital.

“The solution that has been drafted now is that if all comes good, UBS makes a huge profit,” Rechsteiner said by phone. “They got Credit Suisse for nothing at all and the government is backing the losses.”

Despite the frustration, financial experts cautioned that there’s little chance the final price tag will reach the limits set by the government, while the cost of doing nothing could have been much higher.

On the 100 billion-franc guarantee to SNB, “there I see a somewhat limited risk,” said Manuel Ammann, director of the Swiss Institute of Banking and Finance at the University of St. Gallen. “I see more risks in the 9 billion francs that the government is guaranteeing in terms of excess losses for Credit Suisse.”

The government’s SNB guarantee would be partially covered by securities and bankruptcy privileges, which should ensure that even in the worst-case scenario it would be covered without the need to tap state funds, Ammann said.

Liability for the government-backed 100 billion francs “would only materialize if there was a bankruptcy of the merged entity,” he added. “This is a real long shot at the moment.”

Bumpy Track Record

During the global financial crisis, UBS received 6 billion francs from the government and split off 54 billion francs of risky assets into a fund backed by the central bank.

While the government did impose new “too big to fail” regulation for banks after the 2008 crisis, the legislation failed to counter the steady run of scandals and management upheaval that ultimately destroyed investor trust in Credit Suisse.

Systemically relevant banks had to turn themselves into holding companies. That was supposed to facilitate a clean breakup and protect domestic retail banking operations. In theory, all other parts would have been liquidated to prevent dangers to the Swiss financial system.

But Switzerland’s government decided not to implement the legislation, and instead pushed for the merger. The evident lack of trust in its own rules could prove very costly for the image of one of the world’s premier financial centers, according to Ammann.

“Now both Swiss banks had to be saved by the government,” he said. “That’s not a good track record.”",['Bryce Baschuk Bastian Benrath Bloomberg'],2023-03-21 00:00:00

One section of Credit Suisse's bondholders is set to be wiped out following the struggling bank's takeover by UBS, causing them to see investments worth 16 billion Swiss francs ($17 billion) become worthless. The Swiss regulator FINMA announced Sunday that the so-called additional tier-one bonds, which are widely regarded as relatively risky investments, will be written to zero as part of the deal. The move has angered Credit Suisse AT1 bondholders as their investments have seemingly been lost, while shareholders will receive payouts as part of the takeover. Usually, equity investments would be classed as secondary to AT1 bonds. Therefore, the decision ""can be interpreted as an effective subordination of AT1 bondholders to shareholders,"" Goldman Sachs' credit strategists said in a research note published Sunday. ""It also represents the largest loss ever inflicted to AT1 investors since the birth of the asset class post-global financial crisis,"" they added. However, FINMA's move should not come as a shock, Elisabeth Rudman, global head of financial institutions at DBRS Morningstar, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Monday. ""AT1s are there to absorb losses, so it's not a surprise,"" she said. ""They've done what they were supposed to do.""

watch now

AT1 bonds, also known as contingent convertibles or ""CoCos,"" are a type of debt that is considered part of a bank's regulatory capital. Holders can convert them into equity or write them down in certain situations – for example when a bank's capital ratio falls below a previously agreed threshold. AT1s were created in the aftermath of the financial crisis as a way of shifting risks away from taxpayers in crisis situations. Due to their elevated risk factor, they often have higher yields than other bonds. Credit Suisse's takeover deal, worth $3.2 billion, by rival Swiss bank UBS was agreed to Sunday with the help of Swiss authorities.

After years of losses and difficulties, Credit Suisse's struggles came to a head last week after its biggest investor, Saudi National Bank, said it could not offer any more support to the Swiss bank financially due to regulatory restrictions. This came just days after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S. sent shock waves through the banking sector. The Swiss National Bank, the country's central bank, then said it would support Credit Suisse with up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion), but investor concerns remained and the situation became untenable. The development also sparked concerns about how this could impact global credit markets and AT1 bonds from other major financial institutions.

watch now

Rudman says it may impact investor's views of the bonds and how much they are willing to pay for them. ""I don't think it's a risk that they will be written down. There would be risks attached to the pricing and how investors, perhaps some investors reassess the yield they are looking for,"" she highlighted. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs notes that FINMA's decision ""greatly weakens the case to add risk."" ""Whether investors treat this decision as a one-off or whether they rethink the asymmetry of their risk-reward at times of elevated financial distress remains to be seen,"" the firm's strategists say. ""It has become harder to assess the attractiveness of the current historically large spread pick-up provided by AT1 bonds vs. their HY [high-yield corporate counterparts],"" Goldman explained, concluding that this will likely lead to a reduced appetite for AT1 bonds.

The government’s handling of the Credit Suisse meltdown was rejected by a frosty parliament this week during an extraordinary session on the historic UBS takeover. But the vote against the rescue plan has no legal consequences and has been all but ignored by financial markets and international media.

On March 19, the government used emergency powers to stump up CHF109 billion ($122 billion) to underpin the buyout of ailing Credit Suisse by UBS. Parliament was bypassed on how to save the country’s second-biggest bank.

The refusal this week of one of the two parliamentary chambers (the House of Representatives) to approve the state guarantees is thus purely symbolic. However, it does mark a stinging rebuke for the government, which now knows it doesn’t have legislative backing.

Speaking during the session, Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter repeated – in vain – that ministers had acted in an emergency to avoid serious damage to the country. “We were dealing with a patient who had already contracted a chronic disease,” she told parliamentarians. Current Swiss President Alain Berset also tried to play down the issue: “The end of Credit Suisse is not the end of Switzerland,” he said.

But the arguments did not convince lawmakers, and the House of Representatives rejected – for a first time – the state guarantees after a marathon debate stretching well into the early hours of Wednesday.

Unholy alliance

For its part, the other parliamentary chamber, the Senate, backed the government’s plan while making a conciliatory gesture towards the House of Representatives.

Senators proposed making the state guarantees conditional on several measures: a reform of the banking law to minimise the risks related to big banks; a government analysis on possibly raising minimum equity requirements; and a crackdown on bonuses.

But even this wasn’t enough for the House of Representatives, which rejected the Senate compromise with a majority driven by an unlikely alliance of left-wing Social Democrats, Greens, and the right-wing Swiss People’s Party.

The left-wing groups were sceptical about the impact of new equity and bonus rules; the People’s Party was against state guarantees full-stop. “Too big to fail” banks should simply not exist in Switzerland, the conservative group said.

This second refusal by the House of Representatives brought an end to the extraordinary session after just two days, rather than the three that were set aside.

International indifference

The slap on the wrist to government was however barely noticed beyond Swiss borders, with international media giving only limited attention to the decision.

Financial markets didn’t jump either. During the session, some politicians had raised the spectre that rejecting the plan would cause more instability and further tarnish Switzerland’s reputation. But this hasn’t turned out to be the case. “The state financial guarantees remain in place anyway,” says economist Stéphane Garelli. “This decision has therefore had no impact on markets, and there is no sign of instability.”

Garelli, a professor at the International Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, also reckons the vote by parliament is simply irrelevant abroad. “This is domestic Swiss stuff,” he says. “Such a political reaction was to be expected.” Different questions spark interest globally. “Abroad, the main issue is whether the 29 other ‘too big to fail’ global banks are facing a similar meltdown, and whether we are going to put in place new rules to control these institutions.”

‘Live with the risk’

As such, Switzerland might well come under a stronger spotlight when it discusses concrete measures to avert another crisis. For now, however, parliamentarians have only managed to agree on making the government draft various reports – for example on possible bonus caps and the raising of equity requirements.

Garelli is sceptical about the chances of bigger reforms. “You have to live with the risk: you can manage it, but not avoid it,” he says. For him, politicians have limited room for manoeuvre. “The financial sector is evolving so fast – especially with new technologies – and regulations are always lagging behind. We must mainly depend on the ethical responsibility of banking directors and on the oversight work of management boards,” he says.

Credit Suisse can’t catch a break.

In the latest piece of troubling news, the beleaguered Swiss bank has delayed the publication of its 2022 annual report following a “late call” from the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday evening.

The SEC got in touch over revisions the bank had previously made to its cash flow statements for 2019 and 2020, Credit Suisse (CS) said in a statement Thursday.

Shares in the bank, which have been trading around record lows, slid 5%.

“Management believes it is prudent to briefly delay the publication of its accounts in order to understand more thoroughly the comments received,” the company said.

Credit Suisse added that its 2022 financial results were not impacted. Those revealed the biggest annual loss since the financial crisis in 2008, laying bare the scale of the challenge the bank faces as it attempts a turnaround.

Thursday’s news underscores that challenge and will also add to concerns about governance at Credit Suisse. It is already in the crosshairs of Switzerland’s financial regulator, which is reportedly looking into comments the lender’s chairman made about the health of its finances.

Customers withdrew 111 billion Swiss francs ($121 billion) in the final three months of 2022, when the bank was hit by social media speculation that it was on the brink of collapse.

The rumors, which sparked a selloff in the lender’s shares, followed a series of missteps and compliance failures that have hurt the bank’s reputation and profit, as well as costing top executives their jobs.

Finma, the Swiss regulator, is seeking to establish the extent to which Axel Lehmann, and other bank representatives, were aware that clients were still withdrawing funds when he told reporters that outflows had stopped, Reuters reported last month, citing people familiar with the matter.

Finma declined to comment and Credit Suisse told CNN it did not “comment on speculation.”

In October, Credit Suisse embarked on a “radical” restructuring plan that entails cutting 9,000 full-time jobs, spinning off its investment bank and focusing on wealth management.

“We have a clear plan to create a new Credit Suisse and intend to continue to deliver on our three-year strategic transformation by reshaping our portfolio, reallocating capital, right-sizing our cost base, and building on our leading franchises,” CEO Ulrich Körner said on February 9.",['Hanna Ziady'],2023-03-09 00:00:00

Stocks tumbled on Wednesday as fears grew that the banking turmoil sparked by the recent collapse of two U.S. banks will widen and spread globally.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down nearly 0.9%, or nearly 300 points, after tumbling well over 1% earlier in the day. The S&P fell 0.7%.

Markets have reeled since the twin failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank forced U.S. regulators to take emergency measures on Sunday to protect deposits at both lenders.

But the government's attempt to restore confidence in the banking sector has yet to work as investors remain deeply worried about the financial health of other banks.

Those fears are now going global.

On Wednesday, the catalyst for the Wall Street drop was a steep fall in shares of Credit Suisse, the second-largest Swiss lender, which once had big ambitions to become a top investment bank.

Shares of Credit Suisse had already been reeling over a number of controversies and poor financial results that have led to an exodus of customers. Last year, it announced a major restructuring plan that included nearly 10,000 layoffs.

Investors got even more spooked about the Swiss bank's financial health after the chairman of its biggest shareholder, Saudi National Bank, told Bloomberg News that the lender would not increase its nearly 10% investment in Credit Suisse.

Credit Suisse fails to reassure investors

Karen Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics, a consulting firm based in Washington D.C., said she expects Credit Suisse will be rescued by Switzerland if needed, but added any failure could have major ramifications given how inter-connected the lender is across the globe.

""If Credit Suisse were to fail, you would see significant problems,"" she said. ""All sorts of exposures would come unglued.""

Switzerland's central bank, the Swiss National Bank, stepped in late on Wednesday during U.S. hours with an offer to provide financial support to the beleaguered lender, if needed. The announcement helped pare some of the losses in U.S. stock markets.

Credit Suisse then said it would borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs, or about $54 billion, from the SNB.

The earlier drop in Credit Suisse's share price had sparked sharp falls in rival banks, and in European markets broadly, as global investors continued to worry about the stability of the banking system overall.

The largest banks in the U.S. were also hit on Wednesday. Shares of J.P. Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs each fell by more than 3%.

Meanwhile, smaller, regional banks, which staged a comeback on Tuesday, also saw their stock prices resume falls. San Francisco-based First Republic Bank declined more than 20%.","['David Gura Rob Schmitz Rafael Nam', 'David Gura', 'Rob Schmitz', 'Rafael Nam']",2023-03-15 00:00:00

March 18 (Reuters) - UBS AG (UBSG.S) is asking the Swiss government to cover about $6 billion in costs if it were to buy Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), a person with knowledge of the talks said, as the two sides raced to hammer together a deal to restore confidence in the ailing Swiss bank.

The 167-year-old Credit Suisse is the biggest name ensnared in the turmoil unleashed by the collapse of U.S. lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank over the past week, spurring a rout in banking stocks and prompting authorities to rush out extraordinary measures to keep banks afloat.

The $6 billion in government guarantees UBS is seeking would cover the cost of winding down parts of Credit Suisse and potential litigation charges, two people told Reuters.

One of the sources cautioned that the talks to resolve the crisis of confidence in Credit Suisse are encountering significant obstacles, and 10,000 jobs may have to be cut if the two banks combine.

Swiss regulators are racing to present a solution for Credit Suisse before markets reopen on Monday, but the complexities of combining two behemoths raises the prospect that talks will last well into Sunday, said the person, who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the situation.

Credit Suisse, UBS and the Swiss government declined to comment.

The frenzied weekend negotiations come after a brutal week for banking stocks and efforts in Europe and the U.S. to shore up the sector. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration moved to backstop consumer deposits while the Swiss central bank lent billions to Credit Suisse to stabilize its shaky balance sheet.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (BRKa.N) Warren Buffett has held discussions with senior Biden administration officials about the banking crisis, a source told Reuters.

The White House and U.S. Treasury declined to comment. Bloomberg News reported earlier that Buffett had been in touch with the administration in recent days about the regional banking crisis, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday. The source declined to elaborate on the details of the discussions.

UBS was under pressure from the Swiss authorities to carry out a takeover of its local rival to get the crisis under control, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The plan could see Credit Suisse's Swiss business spun off.

Switzerland is preparing to use emergency measures to fast-track the deal, the Financial Times reported, citing two people familiar with the situation.

U.S. authorities are involved, working with their Swiss counterparts to help broker a deal, Bloomberg News reported, also citing those familiar with the matter.

British finance minister Jeremy Hunt and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey are also in regular contact this weekend over the fate of Credit Suisse, a source familiar with the matter said. Spokespeople for the British Treasury and the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority, which oversees lenders, declined to comment.

FORCEFUL RESPONSE

Credit Suisse shares lost a quarter of their value in the last week. It was forced to tap $54 billion in central bank funding as it tries to recover from a string of scandals that have undermined the confidence of investors and clients.

The company ranks among the world's largest wealth managers and is considered one of 30 global, systemically important banks whose failure would ripple throughout the entire financial system.

The banking sector's fundamentals are stronger and the global systemic linkages are weaker than during the 2008 global financial crisis, Goldman analyst Lotfi Karoui wrote in a late Friday note to clients. That limits the risk of a ""potential vicious circle of counterparty credit losses,"" Karoui said.

""However, a more forceful policy response is likely needed to bring some stability,"" Karoui said. The bank said the lack of clarity on Credit Suisse's future will pressure the broader European banking sector.

A senior official at China's central bank said on Saturday that high interest rates in the major developed economies could continue to cause problems for the financial system.

There were multiple reports of interest for Credit Suisse from other rivals. Bloomberg reported that Deutsche Bank was looking at the possibility of buying some of its assets, while U.S. financial giant BlackRock (BLK.N) denied a report that it was participating in a rival bid for the bank.

Credit Suisse and First Republic Bank

INTEREST RATE RISK

The failure of California-based Silicon Valley Bank brought into focus how a relentless campaign of interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks - including the European Central Bank this week - was pressuring the banking sector. SVB and Signature's collapses are the second- and third-largest bank failures in U.S. history behind the demise of Washington Mutual during the global financial crisis in 2008.

Banking stocks globally have been battered since SVB collapsed, with the S&P Banks index (.SPXBK) falling 22%, its largest two weeks of losses since the pandemic shook markets in March 2020.

Big U.S. banks threw a $30 billion lifeline to smaller lender First Republic (FRC.N), and U.S. banks altogether have sought a record $153 billion in emergency liquidity from the Federal Reserve in recent days.

A coalition of midsize U.S. banks, Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America (MBCA), asked regulators to extend FDIC insurance to all deposits for the next two years, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday, citing an MBCA letter to regulators.

In Washington, focus has turned to greater oversight to ensure that banks and their executives are held accountable.

Biden called on Congress to give regulators greater power over the sector, including imposing higher fines, clawing back funds and barring officials from failed banks.

Key Facts

Credit Suisse shares slid more than 60% at the start of trading on Monday morning in Zurich, continuing a poor streak that saw shares hit an all-time low last week. UBS shares also dropped more than 9% in early trading. Other leading European banks, including BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Santander and Deutsche Bank were also down between 3% and 6% on Monday morning. They lead a broader market dip in Europe, with key indexes also down, including London’s FTSE 100 (0.8%), Germany’s Dax (0.35%), France's CAC (0.3%) and Spain’s Ibex (1.04%). The price of oil also hit its lowest level since December 2021, with Brent crude, a major international benchmark, falling 2.5%, continuing a recent downwards trend and approaching $70 a barrel.

News Peg

UBS announced plans to buy its beleaguered Swiss rival Credit Suisse on Sunday. The $3.2 billion deal, partly an effort to calm roiling financial markets, is a huge discount given Credit Suisse’s market valuation and heralds the creation of a new Swiss banking behemoth and the start of a new era for lending in Switzerland. It also marks the demise of a once stalwart member of the global financial system that for years was considered too big and too important to fail. Years of unrest following a string of controversies—including charges of money laundering, sanctions breaches, corruption, fraud and tax evasion, links with collapsed firms Archegos and Greensill Capital and revelations it had spied on its own staff—eroded that position. Its position grew terminal last week after its delayed annual report acknowledged “material weaknesses” in financial reporting and sent shares into freefall.

What To Watch For

Credit Suisse’s downfall comes at a poor time for global financial markets, which are already reeling from the recent failure of two U.S. institutions: Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature. Credit Suisse bondholders are likely to be angry following the deal, as their investments are likely to be wiped out, a move that could exacerbate market worries. Though the troubled Swiss bank’s problems long predate the collapse of the two institutions, the loss of such a historic institution will also undoubtedly intensify concerns. In premarket trading early Monday morning, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase were down more than 1% and Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America between 0.4% and 0.6%. From market close on Friday, all were down between 3% and 4% on Monday morning.

Tangent

Asian markets also responded negatively to the news of UBS’ acquisition. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell more than 2.6% on Monday. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was also down 1.4% and the Shanghai Composite Index down 0.48%.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse















March 17 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S) headed into a make-or-break weekend after some rivals grew cautious in their dealings with the struggling Swiss lender, and its regulators urged it to pursue a deal with UBS AG (UBSG.S).

Credit Suisse Chief Financial Officer Dixit Joshi and his teams will hold meetings over the weekend to assess strategic scenarios for the bank, people with knowledge of the matter said on Friday.

Swiss regulators are encouraging UBS and Credit Suisse to merge, one source with knowledge of the matter said, but added that both banks did not want to do so. The regulators do not have the power to force the merger, the person said.

The boards of UBS and Credit Suisse were also expected to separately meet over the weekend, the Financial Times said.

Credit Suisse shares jumped 9% in after-market trading following the FT report. Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment on the report.

Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old bank, is the biggest name ensnared by market turmoil unleashed by the collapse of U.S. lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank over the past week, forcing it to tap $54 billion in central bank funding.

In the latest sign of its mounting troubles, at least four major banks, including Societe Generale SA (SOGN.PA) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE), have put restrictions on their trades involving the Swiss lender or its securities, according to five sources with direct knowledge of the matter.

""Credit Suisse is a very special case,"" said Frédérique Carrier, head of investment strategy at RBC Wealth Management. ""The Swiss central bank stepping in was a necessary step to calm the flames, but it might not be sufficient to restore confidence in Credit Suisse, so there’s talk about more measures.""

The frantic efforts to shore up Credit Suisse come as policymakers including the European Central Bank and U.S. President Joe Biden have sought to reassure investors and depositors that the global banking system is safe. But fears of broader troubles in the sector persist.

Credit Suisse and First Republic Bank

Already this week, big U.S. banks had to swoop in with a $30 billion lifeline for smaller lender First Republic (FRC.N), while U.S. banks altogether sought a record $153 billion in emergency liquidity from the Federal Reserve in recent days.

That surpassed a previous high set during the most acute phase of the financial crisis some 15 years ago.

This reflected ""funding and liquidity strains on banks, driven by weakening depositor confidence,"" said ratings agency Moody's, which this week downgraded its outlook on the U.S. banking system to negative.

In Washington, focus turned to greater oversight to ensure that banks - and their executives - are held accountable.

Biden - who earlier this week promised Americans that their deposits are safe - on Friday called on Congress to give regulators greater power over the banking sector, including leveraging higher fines, clawing back funds and barring officials from failed banks, a White House statement said.

A group of Democratic U.S. lawmakers also asked regulators and the Justice Department for a probe into the role of Goldman Sachs (GS.N) in the collapse of SVB, the office of U.S. Representative Adam Schiff said on Friday.

MARKET TROUBLES LINGER

Banking stocks globally have been battered since Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, raising questions about other weaknesses in the wider financial system.

Shares in Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second-largest bank, closed down 8% on Friday, with Morningstar Direct saying Credit Suisse had seen more than $450 million in net outflows from its U.S. and European managed funds from March 13 to 15.

Analysts, investors and bankers think the loan facility from the Swiss central bank - which made it the first major global bank to take up an emergency lifeline since the 2008 financial crisis - only bought it time to work out what to do next.

Increased financial volatility and uncertainty about Credit Suisse's future may cloud Switzerland's economic outlook, but the liquidity support provided to the bank is unlikely to impact the country's public finances, DBRS Morningstar wrote in a note to investors.

U.S. regional bank shares were fell sharply on Friday and the S&P Banks index (.SPXBK) tumbled 4.6%, bringing its decline over the past two weeks to 21.5%, its worst two-week calendar loss since the COVID-19 pandemic shook markets in March 2020.

First Republic Bank ended Friday down 32.8%, bringing its loss over the last 10 sessions to more than 80%.

While support from some of the biggest names in U.S. banking prevented its collapse this week, investors were startled by First Republic's late disclosures on its cash position and just how much emergency liquidity it needed.

""It appears that maybe the damage has been done to the brand reputation of First Republic. (It) is a shame because it was a high quality, well run bank,"" said John Petrides, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management.

Earlier on Friday, SVB Financial Group said it had filed for a court-supervised reorganisation, days after its former banking unit SVB was taken over by U.S. regulators.

Regulators have asked banks interested in buying SVB and Signature Bank to submit bids by Friday, people familiar with the matter have said. U.S. regulators are willing to consider having the government backstop losses at SVB and Signature Bank if it helps push through a sale, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing people briefed on the matter.

Authorities have repeatedly tried to emphasise that the current turmoil is different than the global financial crisis 15 years ago as banks are better capitalised and funds more easily available - but their assurances have often fallen on deaf ears.

In an unusual move, the ECB held an ad hoc supervisory board meeting, its second this week, to discuss the stresses and volatility in the banking sector.

The supervisors were told deposits were stable across the euro zone and exposure to Credit Suisse was immaterial, a source familiar with the meeting's content told Reuters.

An ECB spokesperson declined to comment.

GENEVA -- The Swiss central bank hiked its key interest rate Thursday and declared that a government-orchestrated takeover of troubled Credit Suisse by rival bank UBS ended the financial turmoil.

In a statement, the Swiss National Bank said it is providing large amounts of support for the deal to merge Switzerland's biggest banks and that the late Sunday announcement by the federal government, financial regulators and the central bank “put a halt to the crisis.”

“An insolvency of Credit Suisse would have had severe consequences for national and international financial stability and for the Swiss economy,” said Thomas Jordan, chairman of the Swiss central bank’s governing board. “Taking this risk would have been irresponsible.”

The hastily arranged, $3.25 billion deal aimed to stem the upheaval in the global financial system after the collapse of two U.S. banks and jitters about long-running troubles at Credit Suisse led shares of Switzerland's second-largest bank to tank and customers to pull out their money.

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after the central bank's plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) last week failed to reassure investors and customers. The deal was done after the country's executive branch passed emergency measures to bypass shareholder approval.

“The extensive liquidity assistance provided the time needed to find a solution to safeguard financial stability,” the central bank said in a statement. “This solution had to be worked out under considerable time pressure in order to be ready before the Asian markets opened this week.”

To support the deal announced late Sunday, the Swiss National Bank has said it is providing a loan of up to 100 billion francs ($109 billion) and that the government is providing another 100 billion francs of support as a backstop if needed.

Jordan said Thursday that the loans are ""not gifts“ but are backed by collateral and subject to interest.

The central bank hiked its key interest rate by half a percentage point to counter inflation that has risen since the beginning of the year, to 3.4% last month. It said more hikes “cannot be ruled out.”

The bank said inflation was “above the range the SNB equates with price stability” and that economic growth is expected to be modest this year, forecasting a 1% increase in gross domestic product. The SNB said the global economic outlook was uncertain, with the main risks being an economic downturn and fallout from the global financial turmoil.

It comes as central banks around the world are pressing ahead with their fight against inflation even as banking sector chaos has created a global crisis of confidence in the financial system.

The U.S. Federal Reserve went ahead with a quarter-point rate hike Wednesday, Norway's central bank did the same Thursday and the Bank of England is expected to approve a increase after inflation unexpectedly grew last month. The European Central Bank raised rates by a half-point last week.

The ECB and Fed chiefs both voiced assurances that the financial system is resilient and that money is safe in banks.

Adrian Prettejohn, a Europe economist at Capital Economics, said the Swiss National Bank “was clearly keen to try to draw a line under the Credit Suisse saga.”

“They seem relaxed about any hit to macroeconomic activity from the Credit Suisse debacle,” he said in a note, pointing to the upgraded forecast for economic growth this year.

Meanwhile, Swiss financial regulators defended how the deal wiped out about 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in higher-risk Credit Suisse bonds, which left investors with hefty losses.

Typically, shareholders face losses before those holding bonds if a bank goes under — a hierarchy that the European Central Bank and Bank of England reiterated in statements this week.

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or FINMA, said Thursday that contracts for the higher-risk bonds show that they can be written down in a “viability event,” particularly if the government offers extraordinary support.

That happened under the executive branch's emergency measures Sunday, which also allowed regulators to order a writedown of the bonds, FINMA said.

Global law firm Quinn Emanuel says it has put together an international team of lawyers from Switzerland, the U.S. and the United Kingdom that is in discussions about possible legal action with bondholders representing “a significant percentage” of the total amount that was issued. The firm convened a call for bondholders Wednesday that drew more than 600 participants.

When it comes to interest rates, the Swiss National Bank has hiked three times over the last six months. A year ago, Switzerland drew international headlines for its unusual policy of maintaining negative interest rates — at negative 0.75%. That policy aimed to help depress a highly valued Swiss franc and meant that some investors actually had to pay interest for the privilege to keep their money in Switzerland, not reap interest from it.

https://www.reuters.com/markets/cautious-calm-returns-bank-stocks-focus-shifts-regulation-2023-03-15/,Swiss central bank throws financial lifeline to Credit Suisse after shares pummelled,"













March 15 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators pledged a liquidity lifeline to Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) in an unprecedented move by a central bank after the flagship Swiss lender's shares tumbled as much as 30% on Wednesday.

In a joint statement, the Swiss financial regulator FINMA and the nation's central bank sought to ease investor fears around Credit Suisse, saying it ""meets the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks."" They said the bank could access liquidity from the central bank if needed.

The statement came after a major government and at least one bank put pressure on Switzerland to act, said people familiar with the matter, as the lender became caught up in a crisis of confidence after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last week.

Credit Suisse said it welcomed the statement of support from the Swiss National Bank and FINMA.

Credit Suisse would be the first major global bank to be given such a lifeline since the 2008 financial crisis - though central banks have extended liquidity more generally to banks during times of market stress including the coronavirus pandemic.

SVB's demise, followed by that of Signature Bank two days later, sent global bank stocks on a roller-coaster ride this week, with investors discounting assurances from U.S. President Joe Biden and emergency steps giving banks access to more funding.

By Wednesday, focus had shifted from the United States to Europe, where Credit Suisse led a rout in bank shares after its largest investor said it could not provide more financial assistance because of regulatory constraints.

Hoping to quell concerns, FINMA and the Swiss central bank said there were no indications of a direct risk of contagion for Swiss institutions from U.S. banking market turmoil.

Earlier, Credit Suisse shares led a 7% fall in the European banking index (.SX7P), while five-year credit default swaps (CDS) for the flagship Swiss bank hit a new record high.

The investor exit for the doors prompted fears of a broader threat to the financial system, and two supervisory sources told Reuters that the European Central Bank had contacted banks on its watch to quiz them about their exposures to Credit Suisse.

One source said, however, that they saw Credit Suisse's problems as specific to that bank, rather than being systemic.

""(The) SVB collapse is a firm- and U.S.-specific problem, but now markets have reawakened to global banks’ risks – from interest rate/duration to liquidity and credit risk – and European banks are engulfed by a confidence crisis,"" said Davide Oneglia, senior economist at TS Lombard.

The U.S. Treasury is monitoring the situation around Credit Suisse and is in touch with global counterparts, a Treasury spokesperson said.

Asked about the impact of Credit Suisse's problems on the U.S. banking system, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders told Reuters: ""Everybody is concerned.""

On Wall Street, major indexes closed down on Wednesday, with big U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Citigroup (C.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) falling. The KBW regional banking index (.KRX) declined 1.57%.

'FLIGHT TO SAFETY'

In the United States, large banks have managed their exposure to Credit Suisse in recent months and view risks emanating from the lender as manageable so far, according to three industry sources who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation.

Rapid rises in interest rates have made it harder for some businesses to pay back or service loans, increasing the chances of losses for lenders who are also worried about a recession.

Traders are now betting that the Federal Reserve, which just last week was expected to accelerate its interest-rate-hike campaign in the face of persistent inflation, may be forced to hit pause and even reverse course.

Futures tied to the Fed's policy rate were pricing a slightly better-than-even chance that policymakers will leave their benchmark lending rate in its current 4.5%-4.75% range at their upcoming meeting on March 21-22.

Traders' bets on a large European Central Bank interest-rate hike at Thursday's meeting also evaporated quickly as the Credit Suisse rout fanned fears about the health of Europe's banking sector. Money market pricing suggested traders now saw less than a 20% chance of a 50 basis point rate hike at the ECB meeting.

Unease sparked by SVB's demise has also prompted depositors to seek out new homes for their cash.

Ralph Hamers, CEO of Credit Suisse rival UBS (UBSG.S) said market turmoil has steered more money its way.

""In the last couple of days as you might expect we've seen inflows,"" Hamers said. ""It is clearly a flight to safety from that perspective, but I think three days don't make a trend.""

Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) CEO Christian Sewing said that the German lender has also seen incoming deposits.

Focus is also shifting increasingly to the possibility of tougher rules for banks, particularly mid-tier ones like SVB (SIVB.O) and New York-based Signature Bank (SBNY.O), whose collapses triggered the market tumult.

U.S. Congress needs to act on bipartisan legislation strengthening banking industry controls, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, though Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown downplayed the likelihood of Congress passing a ""significant"" banking bill anytime soon.

New York CNN —

Credit Suisse, the giant, 167-year-old European bank, was teetering on the brink of failure Wednesday, stoking anxieties about the health of the global financial system. (And frankly giving markets reporters whiplash as sentiment went from “holy-crap-sell” on Monday, to “everyone chill” on Tuesday, and back to freakout mode by Wednesday…)

After the bank’s largest single-day selloff ever, Credit Suisse leaders met with Swiss authorities to discuss options to stabilize the bank. Late in the Swiss day, the central bank and the nation’s financial market regulator issued joint statement saying they would provide a financial lifeline to the bank “if necessary,” citing its importance to the wider financial system.

All of that happened around the time Wall Street was getting ready to clock out. Stocks ended the day lower, dragged down by banks large and small. As of this writing, the financial world was in a state of limbo, waiting to see how the crisis at Credit Suisse plays out.

‘Systemically important’

It’s hard to overstate how big of a deal it would be for Credit Suisse — with its half-a-trillion dollars in assets and more than 50,000 employees around the world — to collapse.

The failure last week of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature, two much smaller regional lenders, shook investor confidence around the world. Credit Suisse, one the largest lenders in Europe, is “much more globally interconnected, with multiple subsidiaries outside Switzerland, including in the US,” wrote Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics. “Credit Suisse is not just a Swiss problem but a global one.”

Credit Suisse is known as a “global systemically important bank,” (or “G-SIB,” as the cool kids call it). Once one of those mega-banks is in trouble, people start to wonder what’s going on with the system and speculate about who might be the next to fall.

Even with a financial lifeline from Swiss authorities, there are still plenty of risks and unknowns radiating out from Credit Suisse, keeping investors on edge.

Credit Suisse turmoil indicates the crisis has not been contained, Arthur Wilmarth, professor at the George Washington School of Law, told me.

“I think it was naive for most people to think that it might be contained just with a couple of regional banks, because clearly there are still shocks reverberating within our own banking system,” Wilmarth said. “And this would indicate that it could potentially spread to banks of a very large size.”

How are Credit Suisse and Silicon Valley Bank connected?

They’re not, technically. But herd psychology is very much a force in the fast-moving world of financial markets.

Credit Suisse is facing unrelated problems that have been festering for years and just happened to escalate at the same time that SVB and Signature had to be rescued by federal authorities.

Key quote: “Credit Suisse has been a slowing-moving car crash for years,” wrote Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Financial Group. “But now today’s news of course is happening in the vortex of SVB.”

The result is a lot of fretting about the banking sector on both sides of the Atlantic.

BOTTOM LINE

The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank didn’t cause Credit Suisse to stumble, but it did put the Swiss bank under even more intense scrutiny. And it may have super-charged the selloff that brought Credit Suisse to its knees.

Meanwhile, European and US banks are dealing with similar macroeconomic environmental factors. After years of ultra-low (and in Europe’s case, even negative) interest rates, yields on government bonds including Treasuries have shot up, eroding the value of banks’ underlying assets.

“Today’s events show that there are numerous vulnerabilities of different sizes, degrees and locations in the US and global financial system,” said Better Markets CEO Dennis M. Kelleher. “These cascading events illustrate again that regulation and supervision of the largest financial institutions in the United States, and indeed the globe, continues to be insufficient, largely because of successful lobbying by the financial industry.”

https://www.axios.com/2023/03/20/credit-suisse-unavoidably-messy-bank-failure,Credit Suisse was an unavoidably messy bank failure,"Mar 20, 2023 - Economy & Business

Credit Suisse failed this weekend — or at least it would have, were it not too big to fail. Instead, Switzerland's banking regulators cobbled together an emergency solution that leaves nobody happy — but at least prevents a catastrophe for the global financial system.

Why it matters: The 30 G-SIBs — global systemically important banks — are the financial institutions that global regulators have determined are too big to fail. As such, they operate under stricter capital standards and regulatory scrutiny than anybody else. Nevertheless, as Credit Suisse shows, they can still end up being worth a negative amount of money.

By the numbers: UBS is buying Credit Suisse for roughly negative $14 billion. It's paying $3.2 billion to Credit Suisse shareholders, but only because Swiss regulators are wiping out $17.2 billion of the bank's liabilities, leaving those bondholders with nothing.

Between the lines: In the normal world of mergers and acquisitions, that wouldn't be possible. Bondholders are senior to shareholders, meaning that they get paid out first, and only once they're paid out in full do shareholders get anything.

In the real world of rescuing a too-big-to-fail bank, however, such niceties can end up being sacrificed for the sake of managing to get a deal done.

The intrigue: UBS management and shareholders didn't particularly want to buy Credit Suisse, while Credit Suisse management and shareholders certainly didn't want their bank to be sold for peanuts. It's unlikely this deal would receive shareholder approval from either side — which is one reason why Swiss authorities changed the law to enable the deal.

The interests of international financial stability ended up overriding the interests of shareholders.

Where it stands: Swiss regulators forced the two banks together, threw Credit Suisse shareholders a $3.2 billion bone, and zeroed out a tranche of junior contingent convertible (CoCo) bonds that are supposed to convert into equity when a bank gets into trouble.

The big picture: Credit Suisse shareholders ended up losing about $17 billion in equity value over the past year. At that point, there wasn't another $17 billion left to lose — so the next tier up had to take a hit.

In the interests of expedience, it was easier to just zero out the CoCos and leave shareholders with $3.2 billion than it would have been to convert the CoCos to equity and then pay them out at pennies on the dollar. Just finding a conversion price would have been incredibly fraught.

The bottom line: Banks are a huge pile of assets offsetting another huge pile of liabilities. Shareholders only own the sliver between the two, which in the case of Credit Suisse was nonexistent. When a bank is failing, they generally have no say in what happens to it.","['Felix Salmon', 'Https', 'Www.Axios.Com Authors Fsalmon']",2023-03-20 00:00:00

Top economy stories: US raises interest rates by 0.25 percentage points; UBS takes over Credit Suisse; IMF board approves Sri Lanka bailout.

1. US raises interest rates again as it weighs up banking crisis

The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point but indicated it is on the verge of pausing further increases. The small rise is an attempt to balance out inflation risks with the threat of banking-system instability and a potential credit crunch that could lead to a sharp economic slowdown.

The rate hike is the US central bank's ninth in a row and lifts its key interest rate to 4.75-5.00% – its highest level since 2007 and up from practically zero a year ago. But in a key shift driven by the sudden failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank this month, the Fed's latest policy statement no longer says that ""ongoing increases"" in rates will likely be appropriate.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell sought to reassure investors about the soundness of the banking system, saying that the management of SVB ""failed badly"" but that the bank's collapse this month does not indicate wider weaknesses in the banking system.

Ongoing inflation has led to nine consecutive rises in US interest rates. Image: US Bureau of Labor Statistics

However, Powell admitted that Fed officials still need to see how banks might change their lending behaviour in response to the SVB and Signature collapses. ""It's really ... a question of not knowing at this point,"" he said. ""How significant will this credit tightening be, and how sustainable?""

Reuters says that the Fed's relentless rate hikes to try and rein in inflation are among the factors being blamed for the biggest banking sector meltdown since the 2008 financial crisis. In February, US regulators said the country's banks had unrealized losses of more than $620 billion on securities, underscoring the hit from rising interest rates.

JPMorgan says the banking crisis and rising interest rates mean the US appears to be heading for a recession. “A soft landing now looks unlikely, with the airplane in a tailspin (lack of market confidence) and engines about to turn off (bank lending),” its strategists said in a note to clients. “Even if central bankers successfully contain the contagion, credit conditions look set to tighten more rapidly because of pressure from both markets and regulators.”



2. UBS takes over Credit Suisse as banks seek to stem crisis fears

Some of the world's largest central banks came together last weekend to stop a potential banking crisis from spreading, as Swiss authorities persuaded UBS to buy rival bank Credit Suisse in an historic deal.

UBS will buy Credit Suisse for CHF3 billion ($3.23 billion) in stock and assume up to CHF5 billion ($5.4 billion) in losses. Credit Suisse's share price slumped last week after its largest investor said it could not provide the bank with more money, prompting large falls in other banking stocks.

The Swiss National Bank's chairman says the UBS takeover prevented ""extreme consequences for Switzerland but also the global economy"". The European Central Bank (ECB) described the rescue deal as ""instrumental"" for restoring calm, and vowed to support Eurozone banks with loans if needed.

DAX Index

In a global response not seen since the height of the pandemic, the ECB also joined forces with the US Federal Reserve and central banks in Canada, England, Japan and Switzerland to bolster the flow of cash around. The banks will offer daily currency swaps – an expansion from a previous weekly programme – in what is effectively a low-risk short-term loan offering to ensure the world's major economies have adequate supply of US dollars to meet local demands.

However, the UBS takeover has not pleased distressed debt investors and corporate litigators in the US, who are preparing to fight the Swiss government over its move to write down $17bn of Credit Suisse bonds as part of the deal, The Financial Times reports.

3. News in brief: Stories on the economy from around the world

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) board has approved a nearly $3 billion bailout for Sri Lanka. The full programme will enable the country to access up to $7 billion in funding – but IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva says Sri Lanka needs to undertake various reforms in return.

Japan's core consumer inflation slowed in February, but an index stripping away energy costs hit a four-decade high, suggesting that cost-push pressures may persist longer than policy-makers thought.

South Korea's exports plummeted by 17.4% in the first 20 days of March compared with a year earlier, with semiconductor shipments sliding by 44.7%, Bloomberg reports. The country is one of the world’s biggest exporters, and its economic health is a key indicator of trends in the global economy.

Germany's economy will shrink again in the first quarter and underlying inflation could prove to be stubborn, even if overall price growth is likely to slow sharply soon, the central bank says. This would put Europe's biggest economy into recession, after it contracted by 0.4% in the final quarter of 2022. Investor confidence in Germany has fallen for the first time in six months.

DLT has widespread implications for the financial and monetary systems of tomorrow, but decisions about its use require input from multiple sectors in order to realize the technology’s full potential. “Over the next four years, we should expect to see many central banks decide whether they will use blockchain and distributed ledger technologies to improve their processes and economic welfare. Given the systemic importance of central bank processes, and the relative freshness of blockchain technology, banks must carefully consider all known and unknown risks to implementation.”

The failure of SVB has raised questions about financial safeguards. John Letzing, the World Economic Forum's Digital Editor, Strategic Intelligence, explores why – and how – banks are regulated.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/20/investing/credit-suisse-at1-bond-write-down-explainer/index.html,What are AT1 bonds and why are Credit Suisse’s now worthless?,"London CNN —

Investors in a riskier type of Credit Suisse’s bonds had the value of their holdings slashed to zero Sunday after Swiss authorities brokered an emergency takeover of the bank by rival UBS.

On Sunday, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) announced that UBS would buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion) — or about 60% less than the bank was worth when markets closed on Friday. Credit Suisse shareholders will be largely wiped out, receiving the equivalent of just 0.76 Swiss francs in UBS shares for stock that was worth 1.86 Swiss francs on Friday.

But it is the owners of Credit Suisse’s $17 billion worth of “additional tier one” (AT1) bonds who have been left fully in the cold. Swiss authorities said those bondholders would receive absolutely nothing. The move is at odds with the usual hierarchy of losses when a bank fails, with shareholders typically the last in line for any kind of payout.

“The extraordinary government support will trigger a complete write-down of the nominal value of all AT1 shares of Credit Suisse in the amount of around 16 billion [Swiss francs],” the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority said in a statement Sunday.

David Benamou, chief investment officer at Axiom Alternative Investments, a French wealth management firm with exposure to AT1 bonds, called the decision “quite surprising, not to say … shocking.”

The European market for such bonds is worth about $250 billion, according to the Financial Times. It could now go into a deep freeze.

What are AT1 bonds?

AT1 bonds are also known as “contingent convertibles,” or “CoCos”. They were created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as a way for failing banks to absorb losses, making a taxpayer-funded bailout less likely.

They are a risky bet — if a lender gets into trouble, this class of bonds can be quickly converted into equity, or written down completely.

Because they are higher-risk, AT1s offer a higher yield than most other bonds issued by borrowers with similar credit ratings, making them popular with institutional investors.

What’s the controversy?

It is not the write-down of Credit Suisse’s AT1 bonds that has rocked investors, but the fact that the bank’s shareholders will receive some compensation when bondholders will not.

Ordinarily, bondholders are higher up the pecking order than shareholders when a banks fails. But because Credit Suisse’s demise has not followed a traditional bankruptcy, analysts told CNN, the same rules don’t apply.

“The hierarchy of claims remains applicable in the EU… there is no way that shareholders can be paid and AT1 holders [are] paid zero,” Benamou said. “The decision taken by the Swiss authorities is really very strange.”

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, told CNN: “It appears that in this case, because it was not a bankruptcy situation it was considered that AT1 bondholders and shareholders would both feel the pain.”

EU banking regulators and the Bank of England moved Monday to reassure AT1 investors more broadly that they would take priority over shareholders in the event of future bank crises.

“Common equity instruments [stocks] are the first ones to absorb losses, and only after their full use would additional tier one be required to be written down,” the EU regulators said in a statement. “This approach has been consistently applied in past cases.”

Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, said in a speech Monday that banks in the eurozone had “a very limited exposure” to Credit Suisse, particularly in relation to AT1 bonds.

“We’re not talking billions, we’re talking millions,” she said.

The Bank of England said that “holders of [AT1s] should expect to be exposed to losses” when a bank fails according to their usual ranking in the capital hierarchy.

What now for investors?

The legal basis for the Credit Suisse losses may be contested. Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, a litigation firm headquartered in Los Angeles, said Monday that it had assembled a team of lawyers who were discussing options with Credit Suisse’s AT1 bondholders.

The surprise move by the SNB has rattled Europe’s AT1 bond market, with investors now questioning whether their holdings could be obliterated if another bank collapses.

Joost de Graaf, co-head of European credit at Van Lanschot Kempen, a Dutch wealth management firm, told CNN that his fund did not invest in AT1s because he was “afraid [of] something like this,” where regulators could decide that a bank was no longer viable and write down the bonds’ value.

“For the coming few years, [the AT1] market is going [to go] into some kind of a hibernation probably, where new AT1s will be very hard to place for issuers at acceptable levels,” de Graaf said.

The impact will likely spill over into the wider bond market, he added, with investors demanding higher yields for bonds now seen as riskier.

“For the foreseeable future, [banks’] funding [through bonds] will be more expensive,” de Graaf said.

There are signs that shift may already be happening.

Invesco’s AT1 Capital Bond exchange-traded fund, which tracks AT1 debt, is currently trading down 5.5% compared with last Friday’s close. WisdomTree, another AT1 ETF listed on the London Stock Exchange, fell 7.4% in afternoon trade.

But the real damage is the precedent the write-down may have set, said Benamou of Axiom Alternative Investments.

“No financial analyst had ever believed that AT1 bonds would be brought to zero… given the level of solvency of Credit Suisse… [and] pretty high level of regulatory capital,” he said.

https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-obtains-key-approval-launch-wealth-business-china-2023-03-08/,Credit Suisse obtains key approval to launch wealth business in China,"













HONG KONG, March 8 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) has received regulatory green light from China after years of waiting to launch a full-fledged wealth management business in the world's second-biggest economy, according to a company memo reviewed by Reuters.

The expansion comes after the lender suffered worse-than-expected global wealth outflows of 92.7 billion Swiss francs ($98.29 billion) in the fourth quarter.

The Swiss bank is pushing to roll out the wealth business in China by the first half of this year, according to the memo which was confirmed by a company spokesperson, targeting a 27 trillion yuan market.

Credit Suisse Securities (China), the company's China joint venture, recently obtained an investment consultancy license, which allows it to create and distribute equity research products onshore and to engage in investment advisory services, according to the memo.

The firm also scored approvals for proprietary trading and an expansion in its brokerage licence enabling it to serve clients nationwide, having previously been confined to the southern city of Shenzhen.

""We are pleased to have received these licenses as it marks a key milestone in offering wealth management services onshore in China, which is the fastest growing wealth market in the world,"" Edwin Low, APAC CEO of Credit Suisse told Reuters in an email statement.

Credit Suisse ""plans to double the number of relationship managers in China in 2023,"" said Benjamin Cavalli, the company's head of wealth management for Asia Pacific, without providing details on how many relationship managers it currently has.

The boost of wealth headcounts comes in sharp contrast to a layoff it launched in November following a global overhaul since October that led to spinoffs and job cuts.

Sources told Reuters the move affected about one-third of its China-based investment banking team and nearly half of its research department which are based in Hong Kong and China.

Total assets at Credit Suisse's wealth division fell to 540.5 billion Swiss francs by the end of last year from 742.6 billion francs a year earlier.

The bank has offered higher deposit rates than its rivals to attract new funds from wealthy clients in Asia.

The Swiss authorities mediated the agreement, which will allow UBS to integrate its US operations and activities with Credit Suisse's US companies. UBS requested approval on 22 March and as part of the agreement, it will furnish the Fed with an implementation plan for the merger within three months of the transaction's completion.

The Fed has ordered UBS to submit a plan that includes liquidity standards as well as compliance with more stringent “enhanced prudential standards.” Because of the increased scale of the institution, the UBS-Credit Suisse investment banking merger has tightened measures.

According to US bank merger legislation, the Federal Reserve must consider bank mergers when a bank with more than USD 250 billion in total assets buys any voting shares in a corporation with USD 10 billion or more in assets. Although Swiss regulators are largely involved in the merging of Europe's banking titans, the US central bank has to weigh in because each company has American operations. The Fed's decision cleared the path for UBS to acquire all of Credit Suisse's US operations.

Last month, the stunning collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the United States shook investor confidence in Switzerland's largest bank, Credit Suisse. To prevent further banking turmoil, Swiss authorities announced that Credit Suisse would be bought out by UBS, which had also nearly failed.

UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs (USD 3.3 billion), a considerable discount from its prior market value. According to the takeover deal, shareholders would receive USD 3.23 billion, while holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will receive no compensation despite normally ranking lower in the payment hierarchy than shareholders.

UBS received interim approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month, but the bank still needs to secure clearance under EU merger standards. Meanwhile, the Bank of England has apparently approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, according to Reuters. UBS expects the acquisition to result in a company with more than USD 5 trillion in total invested assets.

The acquisition, according to UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher, is a big milestone for Switzerland and the global financial system, but it entails a “huge amount of risk.” The acquisition will take at least three to four years, excluding Credit Suisse's non-core investment bank portfolio, which will total more than USD 5 trillion in invested assets.",['Bw Online Bureau'],2023-04-15 14:36:00

The Financial Times reported that UBS has agreed to buy the bank for more than $2 billion, marking a substantial increase from the initial $1 billion offer the FT reported earlier Sunday. Faber said the price of the deal increased throughout the day's negotiations.

The Swiss government is holding a news conference to address the deal at 2:30 p.m. ET. Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment on the reports when contacted by CNBC.

Credit Suisse reportedly balked at UBS' initial offer, arguing it was too low and would hurt shareholders and employees, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg.

Swiss authorities have also reportedly been considering full or partial nationalization of the bank as an alternative to the UBS takeover, according to a Sunday Bloomberg report.

The UBS deal is being orchestrated quickly, so the Swiss are preparing for the case that it falls through, Bloomberg said, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The country is reportedly considering whether it would take over the bank completely or hold a significant equity stake.

The UBS offer comes after Credit Suisse shares logged their worst weekly decline since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, despite an announcement that it would access a loan of up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the Swiss central bank.

It had already been battling a string of losses and scandals, and last week sentiment was rocked again with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the shuttering of Signature Bank in the U.S., sending shares sliding.

Credit Suisse's scale and potential impact on the global economy is much greater than the U.S. banks. The Swiss bank's balance sheet is around twice the size of Lehman Brothers when it collapsed, at around 530 billion Swiss francs as of end-2022. It is also far more globally inter-connected, with multiple international subsidiaries — making an orderly management of Credit Suisse's situation even more important.

Credit Suisse lost around 38% of its deposits in the fourth quarter of 2022, and revealed in its delayed annual report early last week that outflows have still yet to reverse. It reported a full-year net loss of 7.3 billion Swiss francs for 2022 and expects a further ""substantial"" loss in 2023.

The bank had previously announced a massive strategic overhaul in a bid to address these chronic issues, with current CEO and Credit Suisse veteran Ulrich Koerner taking over in July.

European markets breathed a small sigh of relief Thursday as beleaguered lender Credit Suisse accepted a loan from Switzerland’s central bank, but investors in Asia were still concerned by turmoil that’s hit the global banking sector in recent days.

Europe’s benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index, which tracks 42 big EU and UK banks, ticked up 1% in morning trade. The broader Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.37%, while London’s bank-heavy FTSE 100 (UKX) was up 1%.

Germany’s DAX (DAX) and France’s CAC 40 (CAC40) rose 0.64% and 0.90% respectively.

Investors were buoyed by Credit Suisse’s announcement that it would borrow up to 50 billion Swiss Francs ($53.7 billion) offered by the Swiss National Bank to “to pre-emptively strengthen its liquidity.”

Markets are waiting with bated breath for the interest rate decision by the European Central Bank (ECB) due later on Thursday. It had been widely expected to hike interest rates by half a percentage point, but this week’s market rout may force a rethink.

US stocks were mixed in pre-market trade, with Dow futures down 0.33%, and the S&P 500 futures down 0.24%, while Nasdaq futures rose 0.14%.

Investors in Asia were more pessimistic. Banking stocks in the region fell Thursday, dragging broader markets lower.

But news that Credit Suisse had taken up the Swiss central bank’s offer of financial support limited the losses. On Wednesday, investors had sent shares in Switzerland’s second biggest lender crashing by as much as 30%.

Japan’s Topix Banks Index, a key index tracking Japanese lenders, tumbled as much as 6.4% in the morning session. It then trimmed some losses and closed 3.26% lower. The index has lost 7.4% so far this week.

In Hong Kong, Standard Chartered (SCBFF) closed down 5.4%. HSBC Holdings (HSBCPRA) ended the day 2.4% lower. Local bank BOC Hong Kong closed down 3.9%.

In South Korea, major lenders Shinhan Financial Group and KB Financial Group declined 2.8% and 1.9% respectively.

“What we are seeing is a definite unraveling of investor confidence across both the tech and banking sectors,” said Clifford Bennett, chief economist at ACY Securities, a Sydney-based online broker. “It is highly unlikely these concerns are going to simply vanish any time soon.”

“Regardless of balance sheets, a loss of confidence by investors and depositors can bring down any bank,” he added.

Japan’s broad benchmark Nikkei 225 (N225) finished the day 0.8% lower. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng (HSI) shed 1.7%. China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 1.1%.

Korea’s Kospi fell as much as 1.4%, but then reversed all losses and closed 0.08% down.

Banking shares were hammered in Europe and New York on Wednesday after shares in Credit Suisse fell to a new record low, with investors already reeling from the rapid collapse of two US banks within a week.

The bank failures had already forced US regulators to take emergency measures Sunday to protect deposits at both lenders: Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.

“Markets could get messy amid the fallout from Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse, alongside ongoing uncertainty over the future path of the global economy and interest rates,” said Marty Dropkin, head of equities for Asia Pacific at Fidelity International.","['Laura He Anna Cooban', 'Laura He', 'Anna Cooban']",2023-03-15 00:00:00

The deal was aimed at creating an investment-banking spinoff under the CS First Boston brand by merging Klein’s advisory boutique with Credit Suisse’s investment banking business.

Klein, who was part of Credit Suisse’s board, was expected to lead the spinoff from New York as a standalone entity.

Last month, Credit Suisse announced the acquisition of the investment banking arm of M. Klein & Company (MK&C), part of The Klein Group, for $175m.

Termination of the deal could save majority of Credit Suisse’s investment bank after UBS agreed to purchase its beleaguered Swiss rival, reported The New York Times.

UBS has appointed a legal team to review how to cancel the contract reached by Credit Suisse with Klein without incurring heavy expenses, added FT citing people privy to the development.

The bank, which is set to buy Credit Suisse for $3.2bn, is reportedly looking to reduce the size of the firm’s investment bank in a bid to curb the losses of its newly bought firm.

A person close to UBS was quoted by FT as saying: “We assume he (Klein) is cherry picking.

“The deal was done when the selling bank had a gun held to its head and we are no longer in that position.”

What was behind the shocking demise of a treasured institution – and how will the proposed rescue package play out?

When they hear the name “Credit Suisse”, my grandchildren will likely have to google (or whichever search engine exists then) these two words. For most of my contemporaries here in Switzerland, Credit Suisse is an inherent part of Swiss history and culture. The past weekend has been historical in many dimensions for Switzerland. The country used to be praised as a successful financial center due to its stability and lack of political uncertainty, but instead recent developments have prompted a combination of curiosity and panic. A too-big-to-fail institution has indeed failed, some of its bonds written off, and its remaining assets purchased by its neighbor and competitor UBS.

Why has this happened? Certainly Credit Suisse’s problems did not start last week. Its fate results from a combination of poor strategic decisions, a rotting culture, and bad luck. The power of its brand had kept the bank afloat despite corporate governance scandals, the choice of wrong partners, and a sequence of CEOs and top executives that were unable to restore confidence and lead a turnaround. And when there was turbulence in financial markets because of the default of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the weakest banks sunk first.

While the SVB collapse demonstrates the gaps in US banking regulation, the response of the Swiss National Bank (SNB), FINMA, the Swiss financial regulator, and the Swiss Confederation should be praised as adequate and speedy. SVB’s shareholders and depositors were the victims of a regulatory framework that allows non-systemic banks in the United States to account for fixed income securities as “held to maturity securities”— that is, accounted at cost of acquisition instead of at fair value or market value. When SVB showed financial weakness, depositors started to withdraw their money. Being forced to liquidate such fixed-income securities at depressed values, SVB became undercapitalized and technically bankrupt.

As financial panic spread throughout the world, it reached Switzerland, and Credit Suisse wealth management clients, depositors and shareholders became concerned about the going-concern value of the bank. We heard last night in a historical press conference that survival alternatives for Credit Suisse had been considered from last Wednesday, including splitting the business into parts, nationalization, and an outright sale to UBS. The latter is what ultimately happened after a frantic weekend.",[],2023-03-21 05:00:47+00:00

Male banker accused of intimidating female colleagues fights back,"If anyone has any doubts about UBS bankers enthusiasm for their fun new Credit Suisse colleagues, an article in yesterday’s Financial Times should help set them right. UBS bankers are not partial to their new adjuncts, and they are not holding back in expressing this.

Credit Suisse is “rancid” place, one senior US banker explains to the FT, deferring to give his name. It’s full of people ‘sharp elbows,’ says another, and they are particularly pointy in the investment bank. At Credit Suisse people have long been in it for themselves and encouraged to take advantage of the bank’s balance sheet in order to maximize their own bonuses, say its UBS decriers. It’s a flashy place, full of people who don’t necessarily like each other.

It's not like this at UBS. There, insiders say it’s “friendly, collegial, team-oriented.” People there have genuine bonds with each other. They keep their heads down.

In an illustration of the outré behaviours at Credit Suisse, the FT says some of Credit Suisse’s bankers were in a corporate box at the John Mayer concert in Madison Square Garden in New York when the news of the UBS rescue broke on Sunday. In a public display of non-penitence, they all began high-fiving each other.

A similar, although less vigorous lack of penitence is in evidence in Tidjane Thiam’s spiel (also in the FT) yesterday. There, the former Credit Suisse CEO often held partly culpable for Credit Suisse’s demise through his blind emphasis on hiring relationship managers in Asia, dumping of senior talent in the prime broking division which subsequently became embroiled in the Archegos scandal, and promotion of Lara Warner, a former equity researcher as chief risk officer, laments Credit Suisse's fate.- And says it was nothing to do with him.

Despite presiding over a decline in Credit Suisse’s share price from around CHF19 to around CHF10, Thiam remains convinced that he did nothing wrong and that he was instead Credit Suisse’s partial redeemer. “When I stepped down as the chief executive of Credit Suisse, it had just posted its highest profits for 10 years after a deep restructuring,” Thiam wrote in the FT yesterday. He then pointed out all the capital he raised, his emphasis on the bank’s risk systems, his focus on behaviour and his addition of many, many compliance staff. Thiam, it seems, did everything right. It was his successors who flatulated upon his legacy.

Thiam's self-absolvement has caused some incredulity among his former colleagues. ""I am speechless,"" wrote former Credit Suisse banks analyst Rhupak Ghose on Twitter. Someone else called Bong Capital credited Thiam, saying ""I have never before seen a CEO take responsibility as he does here."" However, this appears to have been ironic.

Separately, men everywhere who feel maligned by women can get behind Robert Record, a former Barclays wealth manager dismissed in 2020 after 14 years for gross misconduct.

Record's misconduct followed ""disciplinary findings"" accusing him of ""unwelcome physical contact with a female colleague, sexual harassment of another colleague and language and behaviour which reasonably could be taken to be a racial slur."" The accusations ranged from excluding a female colleague from a scavenger hunt, staring at breasts, inappropriate touching, and generally behaving in an ""intimidating way.""

Record says this is all wrong and is suing Barclays for $720k. He says his female colleagues made it all up because they wanted to get rid of him. All will become clear.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/business/dealbook/credit-suisse-annual-loss.html,Credit Suisse Reports Huge Loss as It Seeks to Revive Fortunes,"Credit Suisse on Thursday reported its biggest loss since the 2008 financial crisis, and warned of another “substantial” loss this year, as the beleaguered Swiss bank struggles to revive itself by refocusing on fewer business lines.

It is an ominous omen for Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old icon of Swiss banking that has lurched from crisis to crisis over the past two decades, including losses tied to the housing market, trading disasters, management upheaval and costly legal settlements. It has lost money in five of the last eight years.

In October, Credit Suisse announced a sweeping plan to shrink itself, focusing mainly on managing the fortunes of wealthy clients and spinning out its investment bank, abandoning a decades-long effort to compete with Wall Street giants in deal-making and trading. The bank is also laying off thousands of employees.

Last year was “extremely challenging,” Ulrich Körner, the bank’s chief executive, told analysts on a call. “Nonetheless, it was also a year which marked the beginning of the important and necessary transformation for our organization.”",['Michael J. De La Merced'],2023-02-09 00:00:00
https://fortune.com/2023/03/20/how-did-credit-suisse-collapse-so-fast/,How did Credit Suisse collapse so fast?,"Credit Suisse’s near-167 years of history came to a screeching end on Sunday as the lender sought refuge in the arms of cross-town rival UBS.

The $3.2 billion deal, brokered by a Swiss government under considerable pressure from abroad to contain the problem, marks the latest peak in a new financial crisis that claimed its first European victim.

Yet astonishingly, regulators at Swiss financial market watchdog Finma—almost up to the very end—gave the lender a clean bill of health under its highly demanding “Too Big To Fail” regulatory regime.

Finma president Marlene Amstad told reporters on Sunday evening Credit Suisse met the minimum threshold for both balance sheet strength and cash at hand right up until last week.

Tightened regulations introduced following the 2008 global financial crisis never foresaw what she called a “vicious circle” that triggered a stampede of customers withdrawing their funds for the second time in a matter of months.

“Unfortunately the loss in confidence was too great,” Amstad said during a press briefing. “The ‘too big to fail’ provisions are strongly geared at solvency problems.”

In other words, it sought to address the wrong issue.

Credit Suisse’s collapse marks the third major financial institution to fail in as many weeks following the spectacular implosion of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, respectively the second and third largest lenders to collapse in U.S. history.

So how could this all happen?

How can a bank perceived to be healthy suddenly fail?

In short, all it takes is a loss of confidence to spark a run on the bank.

Even a healthy lender with far more revenue-generating assets than liabilities listed on its balance sheet might temporarily find itself in a cash crunch for various reasons.

That’s because banks usually have a mismatch between the profitable long-term loans they hold that are often difficult to sell—such as your average mortgage—and its short-term funding needs.

The problems start when they are forced to divest these assets at distressed prices lower than their carrying value. Under accounting rules, they must be marked down and the resulting losses can turn a temporary liquidity shortfall into a full-blown solvency crisis.

It was depositor flight that ultimately killed off SVB and then Credit Suisse.

Why was Credit Suisse hit?

The bank, which held nearly $575 billion in assets on its balance sheet, had no known exposure to its smaller, failed U.S. peers. Simply put it had been in the doghouse following scandal after scandal.

By the time it failed, it was already on its third pair of chairman and chief executive since February 2020—that pace of turnover in senior management erodes client trust.

A sudden and massive outflow of customer funds nearly sank the bank in October already, but the team around new CEO Ulrich Körner was able to restore some measure of confidence.

After its most loyal investor revealed he had abandoned ship at the start of this month, questions over its future returned.

Amid the jitters surrounding SVB Financial and the broader U.S. banking system, Credit Suisse’s large shareholder Saudi National Bank inadvertently poured fuel on the fire when it emphatically refused any further help last Wednesday, sending the shares tumbling to a new record low.

“The recent events originating in the U.S. hit us at the worst possible time. One time last year [in October] we were able to overcome the deep uncertainty,” said Chairman Axel Lehman on Sunday, “but not a second time.”

Is this a bailout?

Not exactly. Credit Suisse hasn’t been seized and put under receivership, nor has it been nationalized. Instead, UBS is bearing much of the risk going forward by acquiring the ailing lender.

Moreover, CS shareholders are taking a significant hit with the value of their stock overnight dropping by almost two-thirds.

Finally, CS bondholders are being “bailed in” as well, since the value of their Additional Tier 1 (AT1) paper worth roughly $17 billion is being wiped out entirely in the process.

It is, however, broadly speaking a bailout in the sense that an impending bank failure forced the Swiss government to intervene, and taxpayers are partially on the hook.

Up to 200 billion francs in liquidity guarantees have been extended by the Swiss government and central bank, 75% of which can be called upon without any form of collateral at all.

The bigger problem stems from the sale of a portfolio of long-dated derivatives holdings like swaps.

The first 5 billion francs in losses would be borne by UBS, but the Swiss taxpayer would be on the hook for a further 9 billion if more ensue.

Luckily, UBS chairman Colm Kelleher indicated these were not toxic assets sitting on the balance sheet at artificially inflated prices. Rather he claimed they simply did not fit with his bank’s investment bank-lite business model and would gradually be sold in a managed process.

Is Credit Suisse another Lehman Brothers?

Certainly there is a ton of debt sloshing around in the financial system following an unprecedented period of zero interest rates that encouraged excessive risk-taking. This time however there is an important difference.

At the heart of the 2008 crisis were opaque, hard-to-price assets like collateralized debt obligations.

This involved mortgage providers like Countrywide Financial originating loans with little to no regard for the creditworthiness of its client.

These would then be bundled into complex securities for sale by Wall Street complete with the same ultra-safe AAA debt rating that agencies like Moody’s slapped on U.S. Treasury bonds.

Since these highly tailored securities had no real market price to use as a reference, banks used internal models to value them, akin to students marking their own homework. When U.S. housing prices declined nationwide, they quickly became worthless.

What were the risks if Credit Suisse filed for bankruptcy?

Lehman represented the disorderly bankruptcy where policymakers simply let free markets work and a lender fail without taking contingencies—presumably fearing a bailout would only encourage excessive risk-taking and lead to moral hazard in the future.

Since no one knew who had what kind of exposure to Lehman, banks stopped trusting each other and froze all interbank lending. This briefly brought the system of extending credit to the real economy to a complete standstill.

Were Credit Suisse allowed to fail without any intervention, it is quite possible the global financial system would have suffered another cardiac arrest.

“A collapse of CS would have had grave implications for the economy both in Switzerland and abroad,” the country’s finance minister, Karin Keller-Sutter, told reporters.

How is this different from Lehman?

Many of the assets held by banks like Credit Suisse and SVB are standard products like Treasuries that can be easily sold—albeit at a potential loss.

The source of today’s turmoil is not credit and counterparty risk so much as depositor flight heightened thanks to the advent of modern technology. Facebook, Reddit and Twitter barely existed at the outset of the global financial crisis and payment systems are also faster and more efficient.

Now rumors and speculation mean a run on a bank run can happen in real-time.

Under pressure to prevent another Lehman moment at all costs, Swiss authorities brokered a deal much more akin to the Fed stepping in to coordinate the March 2008 acquisition of Wall Street investment bank Bear Stearns by J.P. Morgan

Since the Swiss government is exercising emergency powers, closing is expected before the end of June to end uncertainty for employees, depositors and counterparties as soon as possible.

Investor consent of any kind is not required as the authorities made it explicitly clear the very health of the global financial system was at stake.

What does the deal mean for UBS investors?

The leadership team of Chairman Colm Kelleher and CEO Ralph Hamers, which will remain in place, plan to cherry-pick the two best crown jewels that Credit Suisse has to offer.

Following completion, UBS will have over $5 trillion in global assets under management and double the size of its highly profitable domestic universal banking business.

At the same time, it will downsize CS’s investment banking operations.

Their combined activities will equate to no more than a quarter of the new entity’s risk-weighted assets, UBS will align what remains of Credit Suisse’s IB business with its own conservative risk culture, and it will unwind market positions in CS’s trading book that don’t fit with its strategy.

What effect is this having on financial markets?

Shares in European banks are down across the board due to indiscriminate selling and spreads on credit default swaps—a gauge of insolvency risk—are rising, for example with UBS.

The bigger impact however could come from declining demand for risky contingent convertible (CoCo) debt that was created to avoid taxpayer bailouts.

These so-called “bail-in” instruments, like Credit Suisse’s AT1 bonds, are designed to act as a cushion in a crisis, by transforming debt into loss-absorbing equity.

The decision to allow CS shareholders to preserve a symbolic amount of their investment while letting AT1 bondholders take the full fall is controversial.

Typically the first to see their investment go to zero are owners of a company’s common equity.

How are central banks reacting?

Their number one priority is to quarantine sick banks before they infect healthy ones: the dreaded contagion effect.

The easiest way to prevent this is for central banks to act as the lender of last resort, providing liquidity to all solvent commercial banks that temporarily have a shortfall in funding.

There is perhaps no surer sign of stress in the global banking system than a coordinated effort between the world’s largest central banks to extend dollar swap lines—most recently this emergency measure was taken at the outset of the COVID pandemic.

Virtually every major international lender has large liabilities denominated in dollars since the greenback serves as the global reserve currency.

Cheap dollar funding is often one of the first things to disappear in a credit crunch, so the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and four other major peers agreed to provide dollars on a daily rather than weekly basis.

Whether this is enough to stave off a further escalation of a now global banking crisis is something only time will tell.",['Christiaan Hetzner'],2023-03-20 00:00:00

The embattled Swiss lender disclosed the observation in its annual report, which was initially scheduled for last Thursday, but was delayed by a late call from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The SEC conversation related to a ""technical assessment of previously disclosed revisions to the consolidated cash flow statements in the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, as well as related controls.""

In the Tuesday annual report, Credit Suisse revealed that it had identified ""certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting"" for the years 2021 and 2022.

These issues related to a ""failure to design and maintain an effective risk assessment process to identify and analyze the risk of material misstatements"" and various flaws in internal control and communication.

Despite this, the bank said that it was able to confirm that its financial statements over the years in question ""fairly present, in all material respects, [its] consolidated financial condition.""

Credit Suisse further said its net asset outflows had declined but ""not yet reversed."" The bank confirmed its 2022 results announced Feb. 9, which showed a full-year net loss of 7.3 billion Swiss francs ($8 billion).

Shares were down 5% as markets opened Tuesday but had pared losses by the close, ending fairly flat amid a general rebound in global markets.

Liquidity risk

In late 2022 the bank disclosed that it was seeing ""significantly higher withdrawals of cash deposits, non-renewal of maturing time deposits and net asset outflows at levels that substantially exceeded the rates incurred in the third quarter of 2022.""

Credit Suisse saw customer withdrawals of more than 110 billion Swiss francs in the fourth quarter, as a string of scandals, legacy risk and compliance failures continued to plague it.

""These outflows stabilized to much lower levels but had not yet reversed as of the date of this report. These outflows led us to partially utilize liquidity buffers at the Group and legal entity level, and we fell below certain legal entity-level regulatory requirements.""",['Elliot Smith'],2023-03-14 00:00:00

https://www.finews.asia/finance/39063-hidden-treasures-credit-suisse-asia-apac-ubs,The Hidden Treasures of Credit Suisse,"The federal government and supervisory authorities have forced UBS to take over Credit Suisse. In doing so it saddled UBS with several potential pitfalls. But hidden treasures also await the buyer.

It was hard to believe UBS chairman Colm Kelleher when he said on March 19 the takeover of Credit Suisse offered «tremendous opportunities.» The extraordinary session of the Swiss parliament over the past few days added fuel to such doubts. No fewer than ten proposals were adopted with twice as many motions further submitted, marking the start of significantly stricter regulation of the largest Swiss bank.

Huge Risks?

If the legal risks that UBS is assuming from Credit Suisse are added to the unknowns and costs of a four-year integration, observers have to conclude UBS has taken on considerable risk with the merger. Some clarity on the issue may be forthcoming soon. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (Finma) wants to wrap up enforcement proceedings on the Archegos debacle.

There is another view of the deal, at least on paper. UBS and its top management around Kelleher and new CEO Sergio Ermotti have surprising treasures waiting for them from their acquisition.

This is suggested by an analysis JP Morgan recently completed on UBS. The American bank is acting as an investment banking advisor to UBS in the takeover. These are the most surprising projections:

1. A New Julius Baer Every Three Years

According to the analysis, the acquisition of Credit Suisse will create a wealth management powerhouse. Once the integration is completed in 2027, two-thirds of the combined entities' pre-tax profit, estimated at seven billion dollars, would come from wealth management. In the business with wealthy private clients, the combined group would be in a position to collect $150 billion in new money every year. That much new money flowing in would create equivalent to a new Bank Julius Baer every three years measured by client assets, the analysts write. These figures would make many a private bank CEO in Switzerland giddy.

2. Costs Can be Squeezed More Easily than Expected

The team around lead analyst Kian Abouhossein calculates that UBS's savings target of eight billion dollars by 2027 is not a very challenging one. Credit Suisse's investment bank alone generates annual costs of seven billion dollars, and UBS wants to wind down this business. The costs of job cuts are also likely to be limited. Voluntary staff turnover at UBS was 13 percent last year and slightly higher for Credit Suisse at 15 percent.

The combined bank is expected to incur legal risk costs of around five billion dollars by 2027. Overall, analysts expect net restructuring costs of $8.2 billion, so UBS could manage quite a precision landing between savings and expenses.

3. Swiss business is worth billions.

According to the calculations, Credit Suisse's Swiss business is expected to contribute about a third of the combined bank's pre-tax profits from 2027. However, UBS may decide to share this revenue with the public for several reasons. With an initial public offering of Credit Suisse Switzerland, UBS will reap at least ten billion dollars, according to JP Morgan. The scenario has played out before. In 2015, then-CEO Tidjane Thiam planned to take the unit that is now the Swiss Bank, in a partial IPO on Switzerland's SIX stock exchange.

4. Guardrail Against Setbacks

By acquiring Credit Suisse for three billion francs, when it was worth around 7.4 billion on the stock exchange, UBS created a cushion worth billions against setbacks from the start. Add to that extensive guarantees from the federal government and supervisory authorities worth at least 25 billion francs. This is due to the mandatory convertible bonds of Credit Suisse of 15.8 billion francs triggered by Finma, and direct government guarantees of at least nine billion francs.

Thanks to the writedown of mandatory AT1 convertibles, UBS will save interest costs incurred by Credit Suisse, a savings analysts estimate at one billion dollars per year.

5. Enormous Reservoir of Deferred Claims

Deferred tax assets arising in the US business are a highly complex factor, but UBS has repeatedly drawn from this resource in the past and used it to boost its net profit. In the future, the bank could continue to capitalize on such assets to smooth out any setbacks from the merger. With the sale of Credit Suisse's US business units, such a capitalization might even become necessary, JP Morgan analysts believe.

According to their calculations, Credit Suisse had no less than $60 billion in net tax loss carryforwards at the end of last year, but the bank's management hardly used any of it. At UBS, the tax loss carryforwards at the same time amounted to 32 billion dollars.",[],2023-04-14 05:00:01

UBS has struck a deal to purchase troubled Credit Suisse for $3.2 billion, as bank solvency fears continue to batter global markets.

Why it matters: Aggressive central bank action to arrest stubborn inflation has shaken investor confidence, with financial institutions caught in the crosshairs.

The details: Under the terms of the all-share transaction, Credit Suisse shareholders will receive 1 UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares, for a total consideration of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion). The deal is expected to be finalized by year-end.

UBS offer represents a fraction of the bank's roughly $8.5 billion market capitalization as of Friday's close.

The Swiss National Bank agreed to lend up to 100 billion francs to UBS to support the transaction.

Finma, the Swiss financial regulator, took the extraordinary step of enforcing that $17 billion worth of higher-risk Credit Suisse’s bonds would be wiped out. The regulator also eliminated the need for shareholders to vote on the deal.

Flashback: After years of mismanagement and scandal-ridden headlines, the storied 167-year-old European banking giant was laid low by a crisis rattling the banking sector in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's failure.

Credit Suisse, one of a handful of global financial institutions deemed ""systemically important,"" posted a fourth-quarter loss of over $1 billion. Over the last few days, it has suffered mass outflows as problems mounted and bank sector concerns festered, pushing its stock to record lows.

What they're saying: “Given recent extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances, the announced merger represents the best available outcome,"" Axel P. Lehmann, Credit Suisse's chairman said in a statement.

""This has been an extremely challenging time for Credit Suisse and while the team has worked tirelessly to address many significant legacy issues and execute on its new strategy, we are forced to reach a solution today that provides a durable outcome,"" he added.

https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-borrow-up-54-bln-it-seeks-calm-investor-fears-2023-03-16/,Major US banks inject $30 billion to rescue First Republic Bank,"













March 16 (Reuters) - Large U.S. banks injected $30 billion in deposits into First Republic Bank (FRC.N) on Thursday, swooping in to rescue the lender caught up in a widening crisis triggered by the collapse of two other mid-size U.S. lenders over the past week.

Banking stocks globally have been battered since Silicon Valley Bank collapsed last week due to bond-related losses that piled up when interest rates surged last year, raising questions about what else might be lurking in the wider banking system.

Within days, the market turmoil had ensnared Swiss lender Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), forcing it to borrow up to $54 billion from Switzerland's central bank to shore up liquidity.

By Thursday afternoon, the spotlight whipsawed back to the United States as big banks led an effort to prop up support for First Republic, a regional lender whose shares had tumbled 70% in the last nine trading sessions.

First Republic Bank's stock market collapse

Some of the biggest U.S. banking names including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) were involved in the rescue, according to a statement from the banks.

The deal was put together by power brokers including U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who discussed the package on Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the situation.

U.S. regulators said the show of support was most welcome, and showed the resilience of the banking system.

A round of financing on Sunday raised through JPMorgan had given First Republic access to $70 billion in funds. But that failed to calm investors as worries of a contagion deepened with the demise of Signature Bank to follow that of SVB and depositors began moving cash to larger lenders.

First Republic Bank's stock closed up 10% on news of the rescue but its shares fell 18% in after-market trading, after the bank said it would suspend its dividend.

The bank's stock price is down more than 70% since March 6.

News of the rescue also helped boost Wall Street indexes, with JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America all up more than 1%, while the benchmark S&P 500 Banks Index (.SPXBK) recovered 2.2%.

Smaller banks also rebounded from the recent sell-off, with Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB.O), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC.N) and KeyCorp (KEY.N) each gaining more than 4%.

EMERGENCY LIQUIDITY

Earlier in the day, Credit Suisse became the first major global bank to take up an emergency lifeline since the 2008 financial crisis as fears of contagion swept the banking sector and raised doubts over whether central banks will be able to sustain aggressive interest rate hikes to rein in inflation.

Rapidly rising interest rates have made it harder for some businesses to pay back or service loans, increasing the chances of losses for lenders already worried about a recession.

However, the European Central Bank raised interest rates by 50 basis points on Thursday as flagged, stressing the resilience of the euro area banking sector while assuring it had plenty of tools to offer liquidity support if needed.

The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to follow the ECB move at its next meeting with a quarter-point interest-rate hike that just days ago looked derailed by turmoil in the banking sector.

Policymakers have tried emphasize that the current turmoil is different than the global financial crisis 15 years ago as banks are better capitalised and funds more easily available.

But central bank data on Thursday also showed that banks sought record amounts of emergency liquidity from the Federal Reserve in recent days, driving up the size of the Fed's balance sheet after months of contraction.

""The numbers, as we see them right here, are more consistent with the idea that this is just an idiosyncratic issue at a handful of banks,"" said Thomas Simons, money market economist with investment bank Jefferies.

Yellen said the U.S. banking system remains sound thanks to ""decisive and forceful"" actions following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

Allianz (ALVG.DE), one of Europe's biggest financial firms, said authorities were ""well equipped"" to deal with any liquidity crisis, ""unlike what happened during"" the 2007-2008 financial crisis.

BUYING TIME

Credit Suisse, a bank with a 167-year history, became the biggest European name swept up in the turmoil after its largest investor said it could not provide more funds due to regulatory constraints.

It said it would exercise an option to borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the Swiss National Bank, which confirmed it would provide liquidity to the bank against sufficient collateral.

Credit Suisse shares closed 19% higher on Thursday, recovering some of their 25% fall on Wednesday. Since March 8, before last week's collapse of SVB, European banks have lost around $165 billion in market value, Refinitiv data shows.

The stock market value of Switzerland's second-largest bank has fallen by 90% since its peak in February 2007 of around $91 billion, to around $8.66 billion following a prolonged slide in its shares.

Analysts said the measures will buy time for Credit Suisse to carry out a planned restructuring and possibly take further steps to pare back the Swiss lender.

https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/3/21/credit-suisse-and-svb-is-global-banking-headed-for-crisis,Credit Suisse and SVB: Is global banking in crisis?,"Global banking has been in turmoil over the last two weeks following a series of stunning bank collapses in Europe and the United States.

Despite a series of rescue packages for troubled lenders and the assurances of governments and financial regulators, concerns about the health of the global financial system persist in the aftermath of the March 10 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).

Even as economists caution against comparisons to the bank failures that precipitated the 2007–08 financial crisis, investors are skittish amid speculation that other financial institutions could soon land in trouble.

What is behind the ongoing turmoil in the banking sector?

While US regulators hoped to shore up confidence by guaranteeing deposits at SVB and crypto-focused Signature Bank earlier this month, the collapse of Credit Suisse over the weekend reignited fears of contagion across the financial sector.

Unlike SVB, a mid-tier bank, Credit Suisse is a financial behemoth – big enough that it is among 30 banks considered to be of systemic importance to the global economy.

The Zurich-based bank held about $1.1 trillion in assets in 2021, according to S&P Global, making it the 45th largest lender in the world. By comparison, SVB, the 16th-largest bank in the US, had about $209bn in assets last year.

Although Credit Suisse has been dogged by concerns over its financial health for years following a raft of scandals, the bank’s sale to UBS on Sunday delivered a blow to Switzerland’s image as a haven of financial stability and sparked volatility in financial markets.

While some bank stocks rose on news of the deal on Monday, big lenders, including HSBC and Standard Chartered, saw their share prices fall. On Tuesday, Asian stocks regained some ground in a sign of easing jitters, with the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rising 0.4 percent.

First Republic, one of a number of regional US banks under pressure in recent days, saw its share price plunge nearly 50 percent amid fears the San Francisco-based lender could need a second bailout only days after receiving a $30bn lifeline from top US banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo.

Despite being intended to quell market panic, the nature of Credit Suisse’s takeover has also stirred unease.

Under the rescue plan, Swiss authorities marked the value of 16 billion Swiss francs ($17bn) of bonds down to zero, while letting shareholders keep about 3 billion francs ($3.2bn) of their investment.

That decision upended the longstanding norm in debt recovery that shareholders, not bondholders, should suffer the biggest losses – outraging those who lost all of their investments.

Some bondholders have argued the move goes against the law and raised the threat of legal action.

Iris Chiu, a professor of corporate law and financial regulation at University College London, said banks may be more vulnerable to “information contagion” and market panic following post-2008 reforms that put shareholders on the hook for losses in order to spare taxpayers.

“This means if a weak link is exposed, investors become paranoid about sniffing out other weak links in order to sell down assets or pull liabilities,” Chiu told Al Jazeera.

“I think a large part of that has to do with the increase in ‘bail-inable’ debt that banks have issued to make their capital positions stronger – these place shareholders and creditors on the hook first before state bailout, and can make investors more sensitive during times of uncertainty. Bail in may unfortunately also exacerbate bank crisis perceptions and then leads to self-fulfilling prophecies regarding bank crisis.”

The merger of Credit Suisse with UBS, Switzerland’s biggest bank, has also raised concerns about the proliferation of more institutions deemed “too big to fail”.

Thorsten Beck, director of the Florence School of Banking and Finance, described the takeover as a “terrible idea, creating an even bigger too-big-to-fail institution”.

“But it shows again that all the talk about bail-in before the crisis is quickly forgotten when things turn south,” Beck told Al Jazeera.

What can be done to stem the panic?

After several bank rescues already, there are indications that authorities are planning further actions to shore up confidence.

In the US, financial regulators are considering temporarily guaranteeing all bank deposits, which are currently protected up to only $250,000, Bloomberg News reported on Monday.

Regulators announced similar moves to guarantee all deposits at SVB and Signature after those lenders got into difficulty earlier this month.

Extending protections to all deposits would raise questions about moral hazard, the situation where an investor or depositor has an incentive to take greater risks due to the knowledge he or she will not suffer any losses.

“I do think SVB is going to force a rethinking of the regulatory framework. The treatment of uninsured deposits is obviously a significant part of the problem,” David Skeel, a professor of corporate law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, told Al Jazeera.

“They’re legally at risk, but banking regulators nearly always bail them out, dating back to the 1984 failure of Continental Illinois. This situation reminds me of the ‘constructive ambiguity’ as to whether big banks would be bailed out back in 2008, which proved to be disastrous. Expectation but no certainty of a bailout often works out badly. It seems to me that regulators need to develop clear guidelines as to which depositors will and won’t be protected.”

In the longer term, Democrats, including US President Joe Biden, have flagged the need to tighten the oversight of banks, including restoring key provisions of Dodd-Frank reforms that were rolled back under the administration of former President Donald Trump.

Among the changes being sought by Democrats, who would likely face resistance from Republicans, is the restoration of the $50bn threshold for “too big to fail” banks subject to stress tests designed to assess their ability to weather a serious economic downturn.

Could we be heading for a meltdown of the global banking system?

Most economists see that as unlikely, although turmoil at more financial institutions is possible.

Not only have authorities moved swiftly to contain the fallout, financial regulation has also been tightened significantly since the last global financial crisis.

Compared with 2007-08, for example, banks are required to have much more capital on hand to deal with a severe downturn.

“The global banking system is not about to collapse,” Beck said. “What we see: with the tide receding, we see who has been swimming naked. Credit Suisse is not a surprise – given previous trouble – as are several of the mid-sized banks in the US. Could some other European banks be affected? Yes, possibly, but this would not be the same as a collapse. Overall, the banking system is significantly stronger than it was in 2008 and authorities are much better prepared to address distress early on.”

“The fallout from the SVB failure has been more sustained and widespread than I expected,” Skeel said. “I anticipated that it would blow over quickly given the idiosyncrasies of SVB, and that obviously hasn’t been the case. But I still don’t think it’s likely to spur a major banking crisis.”",['John Power'],2023-03-21 00:00:00

CREDIT SUISSE'S ALLEGED MISCONDUCT

On March 10, 2022, Credit Suisse filed with the SEC its 2021 annual report on a Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 2021 annual report failed to identify any material weaknesses with Credit Suisse's internal controls.

On December 1, 2022, Credit Suisse's Chairman, Axel P. Lehmann (""Lehmann"") stated in an interview with Financial Times that customer outflows had not only ""completely flattened out,"" but had, in fact, ""partially reversed."" The following day, in an interview with Bloomberg Television, Lehmann reiterated his previous statements, reassuring investors that as of November 11, 2022, customer outflows had ""basically stopped."" Following Lehmann's statements, Credit Suisse's American Depository Share (""ADS"") price rose $0.29 per ADS, or 9.36%, to close at $3.38 per ADS on December 2, 2022.

Then on February 9, 2023, Credit Suisse issued a press release announcing its 2022 financial results. The press release revealed that, contrary to Lehmann's prior statements, large customer outflows had continued through year-end 2022. Specifically, the press release reported customer outflows of 110.5 billion Swiss francs in the final three months of 2022, a figure which far exceeded market expectations. Following this news, Credit Suisse's ADS price fell $0.56 per ADS, or 15.64%, to close at $3.02 per ADS on February 9, 2023.

On February 21, 2023, Reuters reported that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority was reviewing Lehmann's previous comments regarding customer outflows. Following this news, Credit Suisse's ADS price fell another $0.10 per ADS, or 3.31%, to close at $2.92 per ADS on February 21, 2023.

Then on Tuesday, March 14, 2023, Credit Suisse issued its annual 2022 report and revealed that it had identified ""certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting"" for the years 2021 and 2022. Additionally, on Wednesday, March 15, 2023, the chairman of Credit Suisse's largest shareholder, Saudi National Bank, which holds 9.88% of Credit Suisse, announced that it won't provide further financial support to Credit Suisse and that it would not buy more shares on regulatory grounds.

Following this news, the price of Credit Suisse ADSs fell 13.94% to close at $2.16 per ADS on March 15, 2023.

Finally, on March 20, 2023, Credit Suisse issued an announcement on Form 6-K of its merger agreement with Union Bank of Switzerland and that Union Bank of Switzerland would be the surviving entity upon closing of the merger transaction.

Following this news, the price of Credit Suisse ADSs fell 52.99% to close at $0.9450 per ADS on March 20, 2023.

https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/3/20/relief-over-credit-suisse-rescue-short-lived-as-bank-shares-sink,Relief over Credit Suisse rescue short-lived as bank shares sink,"Banking stocks and bonds plummeted on Monday after UBS Group sealed a state-backed takeover of troubled peer Credit Suisse Group AG, a deal that was orchestrated in an attempt to restore confidence in a battered sector.

In a package engineered by Swiss regulators on Sunday, UBS Group AG will pay 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.24bn) for 167-year-old Credit Suisse Group AG and assume up to $5.4bn in losses.

Credit Suisse shares slumped 62 percent in premarket trade to a new low while UBS lost 7.1 percent. Those sharp moves followed a day of heavy selling in Asian financial markets as early investor optimism about official efforts to stem a banking crisis quickly evaporated. Once markets opened, shares in UBS fell by as much as 16 percent in early trading, the most since September 2008.

In particular, investor focus has shifted to the massive hit some Credit Suisse bondholders would take under the UBS acquisition, which has added to anxiety about other key risks including contagion, the fragile state of US regional banks and the challenges for central banks as they seek to contain inflation and financial risks.

“It should be clear that after more than a week into the banking panic, and two interventions organised by the authorities, this problem is not going away. Quite the contrary, it has gone global,” said Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jones Trading.

“The reports that UBS is acquiring Credit Suisse will likely magnify Credit Suisse’s problems by moving them to UBS.”

Under the deal, the Swiss regulator decided that Credit Suisse’s Additional Tier 1 bonds (AT1 bonds) with a notional value of $17bn will be valued at zero, angering some of the holders of the debt who thought they would be better protected than shareholders in the takeover deal announced on Sunday.

Credit Suisse’s Additional Tier 1 bonds dropped sharply in early European trade with a number of dollar-denominated issues being bid at 2 cents on the dollar, Tradeweb data showed.

The Swiss banks’ share tumble comes on top of what was already a rough day for banks, as investors shrugged off earlier promises by top central banks over the weekend to provide dollar liquidity to stabilise the financial system.

Standard Chartered Plc and HSBC shares each fell more than 6 percent in Hong Kong on Monday to more than two-month lows, with HSBC facing the possibility of posting its largest one-day drop in six months. The MSCI index for financial stocks in Asia ex-Japan was down 1.3 percent.

Global action

The shotgun Swiss banking marriage is backed by a massive government guarantee, helping prevent what would have been one of the largest banking collapses since the fall of Lehman Brothers in 2008.

Pressure on UBS helped seal Sunday’s deal.

“It’s a historic day in Switzerland, and a day frankly, we hoped, would not come,” UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher told analysts on a conference call. “I would like to make it clear that while we did not initiate discussions, we believe that this transaction is financially attractive for UBS shareholders,” Kelleher said.

UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said there were still many details to be worked through.

“I know that there must be still questions that we have not been able to answer,” he said. “And I understand that and I even want to apologise for it.”

In a global response not seen since the height of the pandemic, the Fed said it had joined central banks in Canada, England, Japan, the EU and Switzerland in a coordinated action to enhance market liquidity. The European Central Bank vowed to support eurozone banks with loans if needed, adding the Swiss rescue of Credit Suisse was “instrumental” in restoring calm.

On Monday, Credit Suisse’s banking operations appeared to be business as usual at its major offices in Asia.

Monetary authorities in Singapore and Hong Kong, where Credit Suisse hosts large regional offices, separately said the Swiss bank’s business continued without interruption.

And Credit Suisse urged its staff to go to work, according to a memo to staff seen by Reuters.

In a separate memo, the bank said that, as part of the takeover, if job cuts proved necessary it would be communicated to staff as per guidelines. The bank will also pay bonuses as communicated before and as per schedule, the memo added.

Credit Suisse staff arriving to work in Hong Kong and Singapore on Monday morning, however, fretted about retrenchments and retaining business.

Unresolved issues

Problems remain in the US banking sector, where bank stocks remained under pressure despite a move by several large banks to deposit $30bn into First Republic Bank, an institution rocked by the failures of Silicon Valley and Signature Bank.

On Sunday, First Republic saw its credit ratings downgraded deeper into junk status by S&P Global, which said the deposit infusion may not solve its liquidity problems.

There are also concerns about what happens next at Credit Suisse and what that means for investors, clients and employees.

In the memo to employees, Credit Suisse said that once the takeover is complete, wealth management clients may want to consider moving some assets to another bank if concentration was a concern.

The deal will also make UBS Switzerland’s only global bank and the Swiss economy more dependent on a single lender.

“The Credit Suisse debacle will have serious ramifications for other Swiss financial institutions. A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,” said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of Opimas, in Vienna.

UBS Chairman Kelleher told a media conference that it will wind down Credit Suisse’s investment bank, which has thousands of employees worldwide. UBS said it expected annual cost savings of some $7bn by 2027.

The Swiss central bank said Sunday’s deal includes 100 billion Swiss francs ($108bn) in liquidity assistance for UBS and Credit Suisse.

UBS will take over Credit Suisse, the Swiss National Bank announced Sunday afternoon.

The Swiss National Bank said in a statement Sunday afternoon that the takeover was made possible by support from the Swiss federal government and FINMA, which regulates Switzerland's finances.

""With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,"" the statement said.

The Swiss government issued an emergency ruling that the deal can avoid a shareholder vote to speed up the process.

Credit Suisse and UBS later said the deal would value Credit Suisse at Sfr3 billion, or around $3.25 billion.

""This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue,"" UBS chairman Colm Kelleher said in a statement. ""We have structured a transaction which will preserve the value left in the business while limiting our downside exposure.""

In a press conference to announce the deal, the Swiss president said that deposit outflows on Friday made it clear that a stabilization of Credit Suisse was required. As part of the deal, the Swiss government is giving UBS a guarantee of Sfr9 billion to assume potential losses arising from certain assets.

""Given recent extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances, the announced merger represents the best available outcome,"" Axel P. Lehmann, chairman of Credit Suisse, said in a statement. ""This has been an extremely challenging time for Credit Suisse and while the team has worked tirelessly to address many significant legacy issues and execute on its new strategy, we are forced to reach a solution today that provides a durable outcome.""

The all-share deal will almost entirely wipe out Credit Suisse investors, with the $2 billion price tag significantly less than Credit Suisse's market capitalization on Friday, and a fraction of what Credit Suisse had been valued at at the turn of the year.

In addition, investors in some of Credit Suisse's bonds will also get wiped out, with $17 billion of so-called additional tier one bonds, or AT1s, getting a ""complete write down"", per the Swiss regulator.

Credit Suisse's two biggest shareholders are the Saudi National Bank and the Qatar Investment Authority, which have a combined stake of 17%.

The rescue deal comes a week after Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, which had a ripple effect through the banking sector and rattled investors who feared other banks could follow suit.

Shares in Credit Suisse dropped 24% on Wednesday after Saudi National Bank, which is its largest shareholder, warned it wouldn't be able to invest more cash in the bank because of regulatory hurdles.

On Thursday, it secured a $50 billion lifeline from the Swiss National Bank and its shares jumped by a fifth, only to drop a further 8% on Friday.",['Jyoti Mann'],2023-03-19 00:00:00

Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS, has agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.24bn), officials from the banks have said, in a deal designed to contain a widening crisis of confidence in global finance.

The agreement, announced late on Sunday, includes 100 billion francs ($108bn) in liquidity assistance for UBS and Credit Suisse from the Swiss central bank.

“With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,” the Swiss central bank said.

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) said that there was a risk that Credit Suisse could have become “illiquid, even if it remained solvent, and it was necessary for the authorities to take action”.

To enable UBS to take over Credit Suisse, the federal government is providing a loss guarantee of a maximum of 9 billion francs ($9.7bn) for a clearly defined part of the portfolio, the government said.

This will be activated if losses are actually incurred on this portfolio. In that eventuality, UBS would assume the first 5 billion francs ($5.4bn), the federal government the next 9 billion francs ($9.7bn), and UBS would assume any further losses, the government said.

Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old bank, has been the biggest name ensnared in market turmoil unleashed by the recent collapse of United States lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, forcing it to tap $54bn in central bank funding last week.

Authorities had been scrambling to rescue Credit Suisse, among the world’s largest wealth managers, before financial markets reopened on Monday.

FINMA, which said it had approved the takeover, said recent measures to stabilise itself were “not enough to restore confidence in the bank, however, and more far-reaching options were also examined”.

UBS and Credit Suisse are both in a group of the 30 global systemically important banks watched closely by regulators, and Credit Suisse’s failure would ripple throughout the entire financial system.

The announcement came in a make-or-break weekend after some rivals grew cautious in their dealings with the struggling Swiss lender, and its regulators urged it to pursue a deal with UBS.

The two banks’ fortunes have diverged sharply over the past year. UBS earned $7.6bn in profit in 2022, while Credit Suisse lost $7.9bn. Credit Suisse’s shares are down 74 percent from a year ago, while UBS’s are relatively flat.",[],2023-03-19 00:00:00

Data provided to Financial News by Morningstar shows net outflows from around 300 EU and US domiciled Credit Suisse CSGN, -2.83% CS, +1.05% funds have reached $5.6 billion over the three weeks since the tie-up.

The latest outflows will pile pressure on the merged firm; investors had already pulled around $3 billion from Credit Suisse funds in the week surrounding the shotgun wedding.

The latest figures show an additional $2.5 billion of net outflows from Credit Suisse funds between March 23 and April 6.

“It is fair to say that there is still uncertainty around the deal and the potential impact that it may have on Credit Suisse Asset Management,” Johann Scholtz, an equity analyst at Morningstar told FN.

Heavy outflows from Credit Suisse funds began on March 14, the day the bank said it had discovered “material weaknesses” in its financial reporting controls.

Credit Suisse declined to comment.

The largest daily outflows remain those recorded on March 21 — two days after the landmark deal was announced — when $776 million was pulled from Credit Suisse’s European funds.

Despite the steady outflows in recent weeks, the Morningstar figures show Credit Suisse’s European funds posted net inflows of more than $240 million over April 5 and April 6 — an early indication that investor jitters are starting to subside.

The flows data does not include all the asset manager’s funds in Europe and the U,S,, and represents only those funds that report daily figures to Morningstar.

Laith Khalaf, head of investments at online platform AJ Bell, said the bulk of fund outflows in the days surrounding the tie-up with UBS UBSG, -2.98% UBS, +1.29% was likely driven by investors worried about the stability of Credit Suisse and those spooked by wider banking sector turmoil.

“Those assets should be ring-fenced in the event of an insolvency, but investors might have decided that a belt-and-braces approach was required given the febrile market conditions at the time,” he said.

The $3.25 billion tie-up between UBS and Credit Suisse — the biggest merger between two systematically integral banks since the 2008 global financial crisis — also combined the banks’ respective asset management units, creating Europe’s largest money manager with $1.5 trillion.

UBS announced on March 29 that former boss Sergio Ermotti would return to oversee the merger. Ermotti, who stepped down as UBS chief in 2020 after nine years in the role, took over from Ralph Hamers at the start of April.

Analysts told FN last month that Ermotti would likely face significant challenges bringing together the two management arms, citing differences in corporate cultures, overlapping product ranges and technology issues.

Scholtz said some outflows in recent weeks may have been driven by Credit Suisse’s wealth management clients moving to other firms to “lower their concentration risk” if they are already using similar wealth products and services offered by UBS.

Similarly, some institutional investors with allocation to Credit Suisse funds may want to diversify if they are also UBS Asset Management clients, he said.

If so, please visit Credit Suisse Group AG Shareholder Class Action Lawsuit or contact Peter Allocco at (212) 951-2030 or pallocco@bernlieb.com to discuss your rights.



NEW YORK, April 17, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bernstein Liebhard LLP, a nationally acclaimed investor rights law firm, reminds investors of the deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in a securities class action lawsuit that has been filed on behalf of investors who purchased or acquired the securities of Credit Suisse Group AG (""Credit Suisse"" or the ""Company"") CS between March 10, 2022 and March 20, 2023, inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Credit Suisse, together with its subsidiaries, provides various financial services in Switzerland, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Americas, and Asia Pacific. The Company offers wealth management solutions, including investment advice and discretionary asset management services; risk management solutions, such as managed investment products; and wealth planning, succession planning, and trust services.

In October 2022, Credit Suisse began experiencing a sharp increase in customer outflows, or withdrawals of client funds, after a series of quarterly losses and risk and compliance failures significantly decreased the Company's American Depositary Share (""ADS"") price.

On December 1, 2022, Credit Suisse's Chairman, Defendant Axel P. Lehmann (""Lehmann""), stated in an interview with Financial Times that customer outflows had not only ""completely flattened out,"" but had, in fact, ""partially reversed.""

The following day, in an interview with Bloomberg Television, Defendant Lehmann reiterated his previous statements, reassuring investors that as of November 11, 2022, customer outflows had ""basically stopped"".

Following Defendant Lehmann's statements, Credit Suisse's ADS price rose $0.29 per ADS, or 9.36%, to close at $3.38 per ADS on December 2, 2022.

Plaintiff alleges that Defendants made materially false and misleading statements throughout the Class Period. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants failed to disclose that: (i) contrary to Defendant Lehmann's representations in December 2022, the sharp increase in customer outflows Credit Suisse began experiencing in October 2022 remained ongoing; (ii) accordingly, Credit Suisse had downplayed the impact of the Company's recent series of quarterly losses and risk and compliance failures on liquidity and its ability to retain client funds; and (iii) as a result, Credit Suisse had overstated the Company's financial position and/or prospects.

On February 9, 2023, Credit Suisse issued a press release announcing its 2022 financial results. The press release revealed that, contrary to Defendant Lehmann's prior statements, large customer outflows had continued through year-end 2022. Specifically, the press release reported customer outflows of 110.5 billion Swiss francs in the final three months of 2022, a figure which far exceeded market expectations.

On this news, Credit Suisse's ADS price fell $0.56 per ADS, or 15.64%, to close at $3.02 per ADS on February 9, 2023.

Then, on February 21, 2023, Reuters reported that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (""FINMA"") was reviewing Defendant Lehmann's previous comments regarding customer outflows.

On this news, Credit Suisse's ADS price fell another $0.10 per ADS, or 3.31%, to close at $2.92 per ADS on February 21, 2023.

Clients at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (MUFG) lost more than $700 million on Credit Suisse Group AG's contingent convertible bond wipeout, according to people familiar with the matter, first reported by Bloomberg on Friday.

Sources say senior officials are reportedly reaching out to around 1,500 clients who lost a total 95 billion yen ($717 million) when Swiss regulators wrote down the value of Credit Suisse's (CSGN.EB) contingent convertible bonds ---- also known as CoCo bonds or Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds ---- last month.

American depositary receipts of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (8306.TO) were up almost 1% in Monday premarket trading.

The bonds were purchased through MUFG's brokerage venture with Morgan Stanley (MS), Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.

Of those 1,500 client accounts, 1,300 were held by individual investors and the rest were owned by corporations, according to a spokeswoman from Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities on Monday

A spokesperson for the bank told Bloomberg that it is looking into whether wealth managers operating within the venture properly explained the risks of AT1 bonds.

Those bonds were designed to be risky and could be written down if a bank needs capital in an emergency. But when the Switzerland's government wiped out the debt at Credit Suisse as part of a planned deal for the Swiss bank to be taken over by UBS (UBS), some bondholders lashed out against the move and sought legal advice

The move rocked the bond market and put the health of some European banks into the spotlight, with similar bonds at Deutsche Bank dropping in value after the event.

""We are very sorry that we are causing our clients concern,"" Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley told Bloomberg. ""We will continue to offer thorough explanations to the customers who have been affected.""

It was the most notable recommendation in a report commissioned by the ECB to evaluate its work on the key task as the euro zone's top financial supervisor, namely to decide how much capital banks must have to absorb losses.

The review was launched in September, well before problems at Silicon Valley Bank in the United States and Switzerland's Credit Suisse raised questions about banking watchdogs. But its findings chime with recent calls for tougher checks.

The ECB has been blending its analysis with the banks' own to come up with capital requirements.

But the five experts - all former bank supervisors from Japan, the United States, Ireland, Spain and Canada, respectively - said this approach was ""conceptually weak"" and banks' own Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) was often biased, so it shouldn't be relied upon.

""Banks’ self-evaluations are often subject to biases that may become even more significant when ICAAPs play a prominent role in the determination of P2R (Pillar 2 requirements),"" the experts said in the report, referring to the second of three tiers of bank capital requirements set under global rules.

""ICAAPs should be used as ancillary information, rather than the basis for the analysis.""

They told the ECB to change the way it sets capital demands and focus ""on specific risks requiring additional capital coverage, while significantly limiting the use of ICAAPs"".

The ECB's top supervisor Andrea Enria said the recommendations strengthened his ""conviction that supervision needs to become more adaptable, intrusive and risk-focused"".

Fellow ECB supervisor Elizabeth McCaul welcomed a recommendation to use more ""qualitative measures"" with banks, which she said could include ""limitations on business activity, demanding changes in the board and management, and monetary sanctions"".

Euro zone banks have come out unscathed from the recent turmoil in the banking sector, with Enria recently saying they were solid, also thanks to stricter rules in the European Union than in the United States.

Still, in a podcast published on Monday, Germany's central banker Joachim Nagel said recent events should spur supervisors to address the ""black spots"" in their vision.

UBS-Credit Suisse merger: The US Federal Reserve on Friday approved UBS Group AG taking over US subsidiaries of Credit Suisse Group. The US Fed said that the UBS Group had sought its approval to the deal on March 22.

As part of the deal, UBS will provide the Fed with “an implementation plan” for combining the US businesses of the two firms. The plan will be updated quarterly and will include UBS’ obligations to comply with more stringent “enhanced prudential standards”, the Fed said on Friday.

In a statement, the US Fed said the plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution. As per rules, the US central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

Last month, after the sudden collapse of US-based Silicon Valley Bank, investors lost confidence in Credit Suisse, which is Switzerland’s largest bank. In a matter of few days, Swiss authorities announced that UBS would buy Credit Suisse to contain further banking turmoil after the global lender had come to the brink of collapse. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets. Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

Besides the US, UBS secured temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, according to a report in Reuters.

Earlier this month, UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said that the unexpected takeover of rival Credit Suisse a significant milestone for Switzerland and for the global financial industry, which carries a “huge amount of risk”.

Addressing the annual shareholder meeting on April 5, Kelleher said that the takeover will take at least three to four years to take shape, excluding Credit Suisse’s non-core investment bank portfolio, which will have more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Describing the transaction as ""the first merger of two globally systematically important banks,"" Kelleher said the takeover ""means a new beginning and huge opportunities ahead for the combined bank and for the Swiss financial center as a whole.""

“Having a clear vision and a sound strategy is important….This transaction is the first merger of two global systemically important banks. This is not in any way an easy deal to do and brings with it execution risk,” Kelleher said.

A day before, Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann, while addressing the last AGM of the flagship bank, apologised to the shareholders for failing to contain the crisis, which led to its closure. In an emotional speech at Credit Suisse's last annual general meeting, chairman Axel Lehmann spoke of being caught off guard, pain, bitterness, accumulated scandals, and the grief that remains.

SBPV managing director Natalia Ferrara has written to lawmakers to demand they consider staff affected by the collapse of Credit Suisse and halt any job losses until the end of 2023.

""We ... call on you to support our demand for a freeze on layoffs by the end of 2023 in parliament,"" Ferrara wrote in the letter seen by Reuters.

""Politicians must not shirk their responsibility,"" she added.

The Swiss parliament is due to meet in extraordinary session on Tuesday to discuss the state-sponsored rescue of Credit Suisse which took place last month.

UBS agreed to buy Zurich rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.31 billion) in a deal engineered by the government, the central bank and market regulator to avoid a meltdown in the country's financial system.

""For the past three weeks, many of the approximately 17,000 employees at Credit Suisse and the 22,000 UBS employees have been looking at their future with uncertainty,"" said Ferrara, referring to the staff numbers in Switzerland.

Credit Suisse employs 45,000 people globally, while UBS has 74,000 in total.

""In the public debate about the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, there is a lot of talk about numbers, money, regulation, 'too big to fail' or bonuses,"" wrote Ferrara, whose organisation represents 6,000 workers in Switzerland.

""But the affected employees of the two banks remain only a side note. That needs to change.""

UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti last week warned there would be ""change and hard decisions"" ahead following the takeover.

The giant bank created could reduce its workforce by 20%-30%, it has been reported by Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger, with 11,000 jobs being cut in Switzerland.

UBS has said it is too early to speculate on job cuts.

Ferrara said it was not the fault of the bank employees that the rescue was required, adding it would take months for UBS's plans to be worked out.

""Now it is time for the affected employees of the two banks to be given protection and respect,"" Ferrara wrote in the letter that was first published by Swiss newspaper Blick on Tuesday.

""It must not be the case that parliament debates money and technical aspects of the CS rescue for days during the extraordinary session and the people affected are forgotten.""

https://whtc.com/2023/04/11/credit-suisse-job-cuts-must-be-frozen-swiss-bank-employees-association-says/,"Credit Suisse job cuts must be frozen, Swiss Bank Employees’ Association says","ZURICH (Reuters) – Credit Suisse and UBS must freeze any job cuts planned as part of their emergency merger, the Swiss Bank Employees’ Association (SBPV) said on Monday, in an open letter to the country’s parliament.

SBPV managing director Natalia Ferrara has written to lawmakers to demand they consider staff affected by the collapse of Credit Suisse and halt any job losses until the end of 2023.

“We … call on you to support our demand for a freeze on layoffs by the end of 2023 in parliament,” Ferrara wrote in the letter published by newspaper Blick on Monday.

“Politicians must not shirk responsibility,” she added.

The Swiss parliament is due to meet in extraordinary session on Tuesday to discuss the state-sponsored rescue of Credit Suisse which took place last month.

UBS agreed to buy Zurich rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.31 billion) in a deal engineered by the government, the central bank and market regulator to avoid a meltdown in the country’s financial system.

“For the past three weeks, many of the approximately 17,000 employees at Credit Suisse and the 22,000 UBS employees have been looking at their future with uncertainty,” said Ferrara, referring to the staff numbers in Switzerland.

Credit Suisse employs 45,000 people globally, while UBS has 74,000 in total.

“In the public debate about the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, there is a lot of talk about numbers, money, regulation, ‘too big to fail’ or bonuses,” Ferrara wrote.

“But the affected employees of the two banks remain only a side note.

“That needs to change.”

UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti last week warned there would be “change and hard decisions” ahead following the takeover.

The giant bank created could reduce its workforce by 20%-30%, it has been reported by Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger, with 11,000 jobs being cut in Switzerland.

UBS has said it is too early to speculate on job cuts.

Ferrara said it was not the fault of the bank employees that the rescue was required, adding it would take months for UBS’s plans to be worked out.

“Now it is time for the affected employees of the two banks to be given protection and respect,” Ferrara wrote.

“It must not be the case that parliament debates money and technical aspects of the CS rescue for days during the extraordinary session and the people affected are forgotten.”

CREDIT SUISSE'S ALLEGED MISCONDUCT

On March 10, 2022, Credit Suisse filed with the SEC its 2021 annual report on a Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 2021 annual report failed to identify any material weaknesses with Credit Suisse's internal controls.

On December 1, 2022, Credit Suisse's Chairman, Axel P. Lehmann (""Lehmann"") stated in an interview with Financial Times that customer outflows had not only ""completely flattened out,"" but had, in fact, ""partially reversed."" The following day, in an interview with Bloomberg Television, Lehmann reiterated his previous statements, reassuring investors that as of November 11, 2022, customer outflows had ""basically stopped."" Following Lehmann's statements, Credit Suisse's American Depository Share (""ADS"") price rose $0.29 per ADS, or 9.36%, to close at $3.38 per ADS on December 2, 2022.

Then on February 9, 2023, Credit Suisse issued a press release announcing its 2022 financial results. The press release revealed that, contrary to Lehmann's prior statements, large customer outflows had continued through year-end 2022. Specifically, the press release reported customer outflows of 110.5 billion Swiss francs in the final three months of 2022, a figure which far exceeded market expectations. Following this news, Credit Suisse's ADS price fell $0.56 per ADS, or 15.64%, to close at $3.02 per ADS on February 9, 2023.

On February 21, 2023, Reuters reported that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority was reviewing Lehmann's previous comments regarding customer outflows. Following this news, Credit Suisse's ADS price fell another $0.10 per ADS, or 3.31%, to close at $2.92 per ADS on February 21, 2023.

Then on Tuesday, March 14, 2023, Credit Suisse issued its annual 2022 report and revealed that it had identified ""certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting"" for the years 2021 and 2022. Additionally, on Wednesday, March 15, 2023, the chairman of Credit Suisse's largest shareholder, Saudi National Bank, which holds 9.88% of Credit Suisse, announced that it won't provide further financial support to Credit Suisse and that it would not buy more shares on regulatory grounds.

Following this news, the price of Credit Suisse ADSs fell 13.94% to close at $2.16 per ADS on March 15, 2023.

Finally, on March 20, 2023, Credit Suisse issued an announcement on Form 6-K of its merger agreement with Union Bank of Switzerland and that Union Bank of Switzerland would be the surviving entity upon closing of the merger transaction.

Following this news, the price of Credit Suisse ADSs fell 52.99% to close at $0.9450 per ADS on March 20, 2023.

NEW YORK (Reuters) – Credit Suisse and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) engaged in a months-long debate over the severity of reporting deficiencies that led the Swiss bank to delay its annual report last month.

Credit Suisse said in March it had postponed the annual filing after a “late call” with the regulator which raised questions about earlier financial statements.

Correspondence published in the SEC’s online database on Tuesday show that agency staff first raised questions with Credit Suisse officials in July 2022.

Credit Suisse and the SEC declined to comment.

At issue were changes Credit Suisse made to how it booked a series of cash flows, including share-based compensation and foreign exchange hedges, and if control deficiencies needed to be disclosed to its audit committee or escalated to investors.

“Management believes it is prudent to briefly delay the publication of its accounts in order to understand more thoroughly the comments received,” Credit Suisse said at the time of the delay on March 9.

The last-minute delay concerned analysts and sent Credit Suisse shares to near an all-time low. The back-and-forth between the bank and the U.S. regulator extended into another week as turmoil gripped the banking sector.

As recently as March 10, the SEC asked the bank to explain how it decided that an “entity-level material weakness did not exist” for its 2021 and 2022 financial years.

Material weaknesses are considered the most serious of such control failures. In previous letters to the SEC in August and November, Credit Suisse’s former chief financial officer David Mathers and his successor Dixit Joshi described the failings as “deficiencies”, which are considered to be less serious.

In the March 10 letter to Joshi, SEC staff acknowledged discussions with the bank on March 8-10. Joshi responded on March 12, saying in a letter that the firm noted the concerns and had reassessed its position.

“We will report that we have, and have had, a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting…” he said in the letter posted on the SEC online database.

Credit Suisse notified shareholders of the weaknesses in its annual report on March 14, the day before it was granted a liquidity lifeline by the Swiss National Bank.

This proved insufficient and on March 19, the bank’s takeover by Swiss rival UBS was announced.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swiss-parliament-holds-emergency-session-082141792.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,Credit Suisse rescue receives initial snub from Swiss parliament,"By Noele Illien and John Revill

BERN (Reuters) -Switzerland's parliament on Tuesday failed to approve the 109 billion Swiss francs ($120.5 billion) of financial guarantees used to rescue Credit Suisse last month, in a first-round vote that was largely symbolic given the state had committed the funds.

The lower house retrospectively rejected the rescue near midnight, with heated debates continuing into the early hours of Wednesday morning as members discussed other measures related to Credit Suisse.

Earlier on Tuesday, Switzerland's upper house had approved the rescue, meaning the two chambers of the legislative body will vote again on Wednesday.

Lawmakers were recalled for a rare extraordinary session to discuss the rapid rescue of Credit Suisse and the Swiss government's open chequebook response to a collapse that many in the country have blamed on top management.

A shotgun marriage which saw Credit Suisse taken over by Zurich-based rival UBS for 3 billion Swiss francs and propped up with more than 250 billion Swiss francs in guarantees and support has been the subject of widespread criticism.

While earlier in the day, 29 of Switzerland's 46-member Council of States upper house approved the measure, it was later rejected with 102 of the 200-Member National Council voting against it.

The votes are, however, largely symbolic because the state committed the funds and lawmakers cannot overturn that decision.

In the lead-up to the merger last month, Swiss emergency law was used so that a sub-group of six members of parliament approved the financial commitment on behalf of the legislative body, to the ire of the almost 250 lawmakers left without a say.

""The use of emergency law has reached a level in the last three years that is beginning to annoy me,"" Hansjoerg Knecht, a member of Parliament's upper house, said.

Calling the situation where the legislative body can only approve the already committed credits ""unsatisfactory"", Knecht said if Credit Suisse was to require more cash, there should be no use of emergency law to bypass parliament.

Story continues

'LOTS OF QUESTIONS'

Switzerland's finance minister had addressed the Council of States before the vote and acknowledged the ire being voiced.

""I heard anger, I heard frustration, sometimes I also heard a bit of helplessness,"" Karin Keller-Sutter said, adding that the merger between historic cross-town rivals Credit Suisse and UBS was not a forced marriage, but one of convenience.

She also there needed to be a discussion around the kind of financial centre Switzerland wanted to be and whether it wanted to continue playing in the top league globally.

""What kind of consequences does this have for the financial regulator? For politics? These discussions need to be had. What do we really want and if we want that, we won't get there without carrying certain risk in future as well,"" she said.

A poll of Swiss economists found that nearly half thought the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS was not the best solution, warning the saga had dented Switzerland's reputation.

Celine Widmer, a Swiss National Council member for the left-leaning Social Democrats told Reuters ahead of the vote that ""lots of questions"" needed to be answered.

Politicians also questioned why the Swiss financial regulator was unable to prevent Credit Suisse's failure.

""Does FINMA need stronger instruments or have they done a bad job?"" Eva Herzog asked during a speech to the upper house.

Herzog is one of the six members of parliament who approved the rescue deal on behalf of the legislative body.

As part of the unusual event, the third such session in more than 20 years, the Swiss parliament had a chance to challenge the rushed rescue package and to discuss whether conditions could be imposed on Credit Suisse.

Last week, Switzerland announced it was cutting bonus payments for Credit Suisse's top management.

Credit Suisse's rescue angered not only politicians but many in Switzerland. A survey by political research firm gfs.bern found a majority of Swiss did not support the deal.

There are also growing worries about jobs and in an open letter to parliament, the Swiss Bank Employees' Association said that Credit Suisse and UBS must freeze any cuts.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Credit Suisse and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) engaged in a months-long debate over the severity of reporting deficiencies that led the Swiss bank to delay its annual report last month.

Credit Suisse said in March it had postponed the annual filing after a ""late call"" with the regulator which raised questions about earlier financial statements.

Correspondence published in the SEC's online database on Tuesday show that agency staff first raised questions with Credit Suisse officials in July 2022.

Credit Suisse and the SEC declined to comment.

At issue were changes Credit Suisse made to how it booked a series of cash flows, including share-based compensation and foreign exchange hedges, and if control deficiencies needed to be disclosed to its audit committee or escalated to investors.

""Management believes it is prudent to briefly delay the publication of its accounts in order to understand more thoroughly the comments received,"" Credit Suisse said at the time of the delay on March 9.

The last-minute delay concerned analysts and sent Credit Suisse shares to near an all-time low. The back-and-forth between the bank and the U.S. regulator extended into another week as turmoil gripped the banking sector.

As recently as March 10, the SEC asked the bank to explain how it decided that an ""entity-level material weakness did not exist"" for its 2021 and 2022 financial years.

Material weaknesses are considered the most serious of such control failures. In previous letters to the SEC in August and November, Credit Suisse's former chief financial officer David Mathers and his successor Dixit Joshi described the failings as ""deficiencies"", which are considered to be less serious.

In the March 10 letter to Joshi, SEC staff acknowledged discussions with the bank on March 8-10. Joshi responded on March 12, saying in a letter that the firm noted the concerns and had reassessed its position.

Story continues

""We will report that we have, and have had, a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting..."" he said in the letter posted on the SEC online database.

Credit Suisse notified shareholders of the weaknesses in its annual report on March 14, the day before it was granted a liquidity lifeline by the Swiss National Bank.

This proved insufficient and on March 19, the bank's takeover by Swiss rival UBS was announced.

The SEC's chief accountant in March 2022 warned public companies away from a bias toward deeming accounting errors immaterial for investors.

Material weaknesses are unusual among large, sophisticated companies, said Miguel Angel Minutti-Meza, accounting department chair at the University of Miami.

""Once you get to the top bracket, it is very rare to see these issues,"" he said. ""Investors will wonder: how could you not fix these?""

By John Revill and Noele Illien

ZURICH/BERN (Reuters) -Switzerland's tradition of dependable consensus politics has taken a battering after the government used an emergency law to push through a state-backed mega-merger of UBS and Credit Suisse, sidelining the country's parliament.

Switzerland's two parliamentary chambers voted to reject the government's 109 billion Swiss francs ($122.82 billion) in aid for the deal between the country's two biggest banks, delivering a slap in the face for government.

The defeat is symbolic as it cannot change the merger, but it is a blow for the government in an election year and makes it harder to build broad support among the population for the biggest corporate rescue in Swiss history.

The use of emergency laws, in which shareholders and parliamentarians have no say, will also damage the standing of Switzerland's financial industry abroad, analysts have said, especially as it faces rising competition from other financial centres like Singapore.

The Swiss political model is under pressure at the moment, said political scientist Michael Hermann, a director of pollsters Sotomo, adding that the foreign perception of Switzerland as business friendly and as a financial safe haven could be undermined.

""Legitimacy in Swiss politics has been weakened, People who worried about an over powerful government during COVID will see their fears confirmed,"" said Hermann.

""This is damaging for the trust in democracy – parliament says no, but the emergency credits still go through.""

A recent Sotomo poll showed two thirds of the population was against the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse, while a third of respondents were angry that emergency laws had been used to bypass parliament.

The affair has already boosted support for populist right wing groups like the anti-immigrant Swiss People's Party (SVP) and the libertarian Aufrecht Schweiz movement in local elections since the takeover. Both parties are looking to make gains in national elections in October.

PARLIAMENT 'CIRCUMVENTED'

The Credit Suisse/UBS merger marked the first time that parliament had withheld its support for emergency laws designed to deal quickly with crises.

The facility to act without parliamentary approval, introduced in 2000, was used during the COVID pandemic to enforce restrictions and again last year to provide a Swiss energy producer with a credit line.

In the lead-up to the UBS/Credit Suisse merger last month, Swiss emergency law allowed a sub-group of six members of parliament to approve a cabinet plan to give financial aid on behalf of the legislative body, angering the almost 250 lawmakers, who were left without a say.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter defended the use of the emergency powers, saying Switzerland was not an ""emergency dictatorship.""

""We don't do it for fun. We really didn't know what else to do,"" Keller-Sutter told parliament during a stormy emergency session this week. ""The emergency law is based on the federal constitution and I don't think it's correct to say it's illegal.""

Lawmakers were dismayed.

""It has not been a great moment for Swiss democracy. It is terrible parliament has been put in this position and basically circumvented,"" said Roger Nordmann, leader of the Social Democrat group in the Swiss lower house told Reuters.

The Swiss government said it would take into account the rejection by parliament, but stressed the success of the takeover of Switzerland's second biggest bank - intended to prevent a financial meltdown - was paramount.

Industry experts said the deal was unlikely to be changed by politicians, with UBS being given a free hand to determine how many jobs will go and what will be done with Credit Suisse's valuable domestic retail banking business.

Swiss media has reported that the takeover could result in the combined bank cutting its Swiss workforce by up to 30%, which could cost 11,000 jobs.

""Despite the anger, most policy-makers do not want to interfere in the merger, to create and bear the risk that the merger does not succeed,"" said Hans Gersbach, co-director of the KOF economic research institute at ETH Zurich.

""Politicians might have wanted to show their disapproval about what happened, but they don’t want the UBS takeover to fail.""

Ultimately, 209 billion Swiss francs are being provided as state and central bank guarantees and support in the plan drawn up by the seven-strong Swiss cabinet, which has members from four political parties.

The amount is equivalent to around a quarter of Switzerland's entire economic output, and includes emergency liquidity injections and a state pledge to absorb up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS, based on documents outlining the deal.

Peter Kunz, an expert in economic law at the University of Bern, said the lawmakers were ultimately powerless to change it.

""In Switzerland, we often pat ourselves on the back for having the oldest democracy in the world. Yet seven people decided on 250 billion francs of support, an unimaginably huge sum of money,"" he said.

""And the parliament has no say in the matter. The use of such emergency legislation, overturning antitrust rules, is a problem for Swiss democracy and rule of law. It calls Swiss democracy into question.""

If so, please visit Credit Suisse Group AG Shareholder Class Action Lawsuit or contact Peter Allocco at (212) 951-2030 or pallocco@bernlieb.com to discuss your rights.

NEW YORK, April 11, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Bernstein Liebhard LLP, a nationally acclaimed investor rights law firm, reminds investors of the deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in a securities class action lawsuit that has been filed on behalf of investors who purchased or acquired the securities of Credit Suisse Group AG (""Credit Suisse"" or the ""Company"") CS between March 10, 2022 and March 20, 2023, inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Credit Suisse, together with its subsidiaries, provides various financial services in Switzerland, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Americas, and Asia Pacific. The Company offers wealth management solutions, including investment advice and discretionary asset management services; risk management solutions, such as managed investment products; and wealth planning, succession planning, and trust services.

In October 2022, Credit Suisse began experiencing a sharp increase in customer outflows, or withdrawals of client funds, after a series of quarterly losses and risk and compliance failures significantly decreased the Company's American Depositary Share (""ADS"") price.

On December 1, 2022, Credit Suisse's Chairman, Defendant Axel P. Lehmann (""Lehmann""), stated in an interview with Financial Times that customer outflows had not only ""completely flattened out,"" but had, in fact, ""partially reversed.""

The following day, in an interview with Bloomberg Television, Defendant Lehmann reiterated his previous statements, reassuring investors that as of November 11, 2022, customer outflows had ""basically stopped"".

Following Defendant Lehmann's statements, Credit Suisse's ADS price rose $0.29 per ADS, or 9.36%, to close at $3.38 per ADS on December 2, 2022.

Plaintiff alleges that Defendants made materially false and misleading statements throughout the Class Period. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants failed to disclose that: (i) contrary to Defendant Lehmann's representations in December 2022, the sharp increase in customer outflows Credit Suisse began experiencing in October 2022 remained ongoing; (ii) accordingly, Credit Suisse had downplayed the impact of the Company's recent series of quarterly losses and risk and compliance failures on liquidity and its ability to retain client funds; and (iii) as a result, Credit Suisse had overstated the Company's financial position and/or prospects.

On February 9, 2023, Credit Suisse issued a press release announcing its 2022 financial results. The press release revealed that, contrary to Defendant Lehmann's prior statements, large customer outflows had continued through year-end 2022. Specifically, the press release reported customer outflows of 110.5 billion Swiss francs in the final three months of 2022, a figure which far exceeded market expectations.

On this news, Credit Suisse's ADS price fell $0.56 per ADS, or 15.64%, to close at $3.02 per ADS on February 9, 2023.

Then, on February 21, 2023, Reuters reported that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (""FINMA"") was reviewing Defendant Lehmann's previous comments regarding customer outflows.

On this news, Credit Suisse's ADS price fell another $0.10 per ADS, or 3.31%, to close at $2.92 per ADS on February 21, 2023.

If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than May 8, 2023 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as lead plaintiff.

Sight deposits - cash held by commercial banks overnight with the SNB - fell by 31 billion Swiss francs ($34.3 billion)last week, data published by the central bank showed.

The drop was the second-biggest weekly decline on record, second only to when the SNB started mopping up market liquidity after it quit negative interest rates last September.

In recent weeks sight deposits have soared as Credit Suisse received emergency liquidity infusions to head off a bank run as nervous customers pulled out their cash.

The lender last month said it intended to borrow up to 50 billion francs from the SNB in a last-ditch attempt to save itself after confidence evaporated following a string of blunders.

Following a state-sponsored takeover by rival UBS, another 200 billion francs in liquidity was also made available by the SNB.

As a result sight deposits rose from 515 billion in mid March to peak at 567 billion francs as the SNB deposited the cash with Credit Suisse, an upward trend which reversed last week as sight deposits fell to 532 billion francs.

Credit Suisse, the SNB and UBS declined to comment on the development.

Karsten Junius, an economist at J.Safra Sarasin, said the decline could be attributed to Credit Suisse paying back some of the emergency liquidity it took and no longer needing to draw on the central bank support.

""Confidence in the bank has been restored by the UBS merger, and from this data it would appear customer outflows have stopped,"" Junius said.

""A bank run has been stopped by the SNB coming in and offering massive liquidity and customers are reassured by UBS being there too. Credit lines from other banks would also appear to have been re-established.""

The SNB may also have been active in forex markets, selling some of its foreign currencies to prop up the franc, an activity which would have seen sight deposits decline as the SNB received francs from commercial banks in return.

Story continues

But this was likely to be minor, Junius said, saying the SNB only sold foreign currencies worth 27 billion in the last three months of 2022.

""It's extremely unlikely the SNB sold more than 30 billion of forex just last week,"" Junius said. ""Confidence has been restored – the rescue seems to have done the trick. It seems to have been a successful operation.""

The National Council, through an unusual left-right alliance, voted twice over the last day to reject government guarantees authorized last month of 100 billion Swiss francs (about $110 billion) to help keep Credit Suisse afloat and 9 billion francs to help UBS mop up any losses it may incur in the deal.

The votes took place in a special parliamentary session that wrapped up Wednesday to scrutinize long-running troubles at Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old bank that was a pillar of Swiss finance, and the government plan to save it from a collapse that could have shaken the global financial system.

Switzerland's main right-wing party opposed tighter regulations on banks, while centrists favored tougher rules but would accept state help for banks in some cases. Left-leaning parties that have long decried “overly dangerous” banks were insistent on stricter limits on bonuses for top executives and requirements for more money to be kept on hand by the biggest lenders.

""The whole discussion centered on whether more regulation was needed — in particular to the leverage ratio — and severely regulate bonuses of the managers of the big, systemically important banks,"" Socialist lawmaker Roger Nordmann said.

GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland's lower house of parliament issued a searing — though symbolic — rebuke Wednesday of an emergency plan spearheaded by the executive branch to prop up embattled Credit Suisse and shepherd it into a takeover by Swiss banking rival UBS.

By Noele Illien

BERN (Reuters) -Switzerland's parliament rejected on Wednesday the government's 109 billion Swiss francs ($120.82 billion) aid for Credit Suisse's merger with UBS, leaving the fallen bank's hastily arranged rescue without a largely symbolic parliamentary blessing.

While the upper house had approved the government's contribution to the rescue package, parliament's lower, and larger chamber, pushed back again on Wednesday.

It had already rejected the proposals in a late night session on Tuesday, forcing the upper house to find a solution when it met again on Wednesday.

Seeking a compromise, the upper house passed changes to the measure on Wednesday morning, but it was not enough to sway the lower house lawmakers.

They turned it down by 103 votes to 71 in favour, a similar level of opposition to the night before.

Speaking just before the lower house vote, Cedric Wermuth, the co-president of the Social Democrats said the party just could not support the funding.

While the government's commitment, made using emergency law, cannot be overturned, the vote marks a symbolic rebuke for the authorities, whose decision to largely bypass the nation's legislative has angered many politicians.

Lawmakers who backed an approval of the deal, voiced concern about Switzerland's image.

""It doesn't really matter what we decide in detail, but it would really send a bad signal if these loans were rejected,"" said Eva Herzog, who is a member of the Council of States, the upper house, before the vote.

Following a day of heated debates held in the country's four national languages, that continued into early morning hours, the upper house passed changes aimed at winning over the sceptics.

They included a proposal for Switzerland's federal government to draft an amendment to the country's Banking Act. Its aim would be to reduce the risks posed by systemically relevant banks, such as Credit Suisse and UBS for Switzerland, by, for example, raising capital requirements and restricting bonuses.

Addressing parliament before the vote on Wednesday, finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter told lawmakers to consider what message their rejection of the rescue would send to the world.

""What signal do you want to give internationally, are the institutions reliable, do you value financial market stability in a place where you already have a financial centre with a certain importance?""

Lawmakers were recalled to the country's capital, Bern, for the rare extraordinary session to discuss the Swiss government's open chequebook response to a collapse that many in the country have blamed on Credit Suisse's top management.

Last month's shotgun marriage which saw the bank taken over by rival UBS for 3 billion Swiss francs and propped up with more than 250 billion Swiss francs in guarantees and support has drawn widespread criticism.

The government invoked Swiss emergency law so that a sub-group of six members of parliament approved the financial commitment on behalf of the legislative body, to the ire of the almost 250 lawmakers left without a say.

""The use of emergency law has reached a level in the last three years that is beginning to annoy me,"" Hansjoerg Knecht, a member of Parliament's upper house, said on Tuesday.

Dragi Ristevski will become Head of Financial Sponsors, Asia Pacific for Macquarie Capital, according to a memo Wednesday. Based in Sydney, Ristevski will sit on the APAC Group Heads Committee and will work alongside Dieu Ndenzako to build a new specialist private equity coverage team for the Asia-Pacific market, the bank said in the memo.

A representative for Macquarie confirmed the contents of the memo. Representatives for Credit Suisse didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Ristevski, who joined the Swiss bank from Citigroup Inc. in February 2021, was swiftly elevated to regional head as other senior leaders departed. He advised KKR & Co on its A$1.2 billion ($800 million) acquisition of ProbeCX and its proposal to acquire hospital operator Ramsay Health Care Ltd., as well as TPG Inc. on its sale of a strategic stake in veterinary firm Greencross to AustralianSuper, according to the memo.

Ristevski, who also worked at Macquarie earlier in his career, will report to Tim Joyce.

The Australian Financial Review reported the move earlier Wednesday.

UBS Group AG bought Credit Suisse last month in a deal orchestrated by the Swiss government, following a collapse in confidence at the lender that threatened to trigger a broader financial crisis.

GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland's lower house of parliament issued a searing — though symbolic — rebuke Wednesday of an emergency plan spearheaded by the executive branch to prop up embattled Credit Suisse and shepherd it into a takeover by Swiss banking rival UBS.

Credit Suisse and certain of its executives are charged with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws.

On February 9, 2023, the Company announced its 2022 financial results, disclosing that, contrary to its prior statements, it had continued to experience large customer outflows through yearend 2022, specifically, outflows of 110.5 billion Swiss francs in the final three months of 2022, a figure which far exceeded market expectations. On this news, shares of Credit Suisse fell $0.56 per ADS, or 15.64%, to close at $3.02 per ADS on February 9, 2023. Then, on March 15, 2023, news media sources revealed that the Company’s “biggest backer,” Saudi National Bank, would not buy any more of the Company’s shares on regulatory grounds. On this news, shares of Credit Suisse fell 13.94% to close at $2.16 per ADS.

The case is Calhoun v. Credit Suisse Group AG, et al., No. 23-cv-01297.

A subsequently-filed case, Turner v. Credit Suisse Group AG, et al., No. 23-cv-01476, expanded the class period.

What Happened: At an extraordinary government session held to discuss the lender's collapse, 102 parliamentarians voted against the measure, reported Reuters.

The votes are, however, largely symbolic as the government has committed the funds and lawmakers cannot overturn that decision.

Switzerland’s upper house had voted in favor of the government guarantees, earlier on Tuesday.

Significant Challenge: Earlier, UBS Group AG UBS executives reportedly told shareholders that its unexpected takeover of Credit Suisse was a milestone for the industry and a significant challenge for the bank.

Describing the transaction as “the first merger of two globally systematically important banks,” Chairman Colm Kelleher sought to assure investors that it also meant “a new beginning and huge opportunities ahead for the combined bank and the Swiss financial center as a whole.”

April 13 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Group AG has hired BlackRock Inc to help sell a portfolio of structured bonds for the Swiss bank, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.

BlackRock's Financial Markets Advisory group has been selling off securities over the last two weeks, including pieces of collateralized loan obligations, commercial mortgage bonds and niche asset-backed debt, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

BlackRock and Credit Suisse declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.

The move comes after the Swiss lender was acquired by UBS Group AG in a state-brokered deal.

Earlier this month, U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) retained BlackRock's unit to sell the securities portfolios it kept in receivership after the collapse of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank.

In March, law firm Pallas Partners told Reuters that they along with a Swiss council were working on possible legal action on behalf of some Credit Suisse AT1 bond investors whose holdings were wiped out following the bank's takeover.

(Alessandro della Valle/Keystone via AP)

Switzerland’s lower house of parliament issued a searing — though symbolic — rebuke Wednesday of an emergency plan spearheaded by the executive branch to prop up embattled Credit Suisse and shepherd it into a takeover by Swiss banking rival UBS.

The National Council, through an unusual left-right alliance, voted twice over the last day to reject government guarantees authorized last month of 100 billion Swiss francs (about $110 billion) to help keep Credit Suisse afloat and 9 billion francs to help UBS mop up any losses it may incur in the deal.

The votes took place in a special parliamentary session that wrapped up Wednesday to scrutinize long-running troubles at Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old bank that was a pillar of Swiss finance, and the government plan to save it from a collapse that could have shaken the global financial system.

Switzerland’s main right-wing party opposed tighter regulations on banks, while centrists favored tougher rules but would accept state help for banks in some cases. Left-leaning parties that have long decried “overly dangerous” banks were insistent on stricter limits on bonuses for top executives and requirements for more money to be kept on hand by the biggest lenders.

“The whole discussion centered on whether more regulation was needed — in particular to the leverage ratio — and severely regulate bonuses of the managers of the big, systemically important banks,” Socialist lawmaker Roger Nordmann said.

Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter, who has been at the epicenter of a political firestorm around the 3 billion franc ($3.25 billion) Credit Suisse-UBS deal, told lawmakers that capital requirements would be increased — and “you can start from the premise that big banks will face more severe restrictions.”

But Nordmann, who had questioned the minister on that issue, said by phone that Keller-Sutter hadn’t presented any clear measures and was too noncommittal.

“That’s an invitation for all dishonest bankers to come to Switzerland, and what we need is honest people,” he said.

The votes were symbolic because a parliamentary commission has already signed on to the emergency rescue plan that Swiss authorities orchestrated last month as shares of Credit Suisse sank and customers rushed to pull out their money. The failure of two U.S. banks just days before had sparked concerns about the stability of the Swiss lender and the global financial system.

Both the Swiss central bank and the government splashed out more than 200 billion Swiss francs in guarantees to help underpin the fusion of the country’s top two banks and keep Credit Suisse from failing.

Parliament’s upper house had voted Tuesday to accept the takeover plan announced March 19 by Switzerland’s seven-member executive branch — known as the Federal Council, which is headed by the Swiss president — as well as the Swiss National Bank and the financial markets regulator, FINMA.

Lawmakers in the upper house backed a plan that would have included limits to bonuses for bankers, but it didn’t go far enough for the lower house.

The projected annual revenue for Progressive is $57,099MM, an increase of 15.15%. The projected annual non-GAAP EPS is $6.35.

Progressive Declares $0.10 Dividend

On March 3, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of April 6, 2023 received the payment on April 14, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share.

At the current share price of $138.21 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.29%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 2.96%, the lowest has been 0.27%, and the highest has been 5.69%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.43 (n=237).

The current dividend yield is 1.86 standard deviations below the historical average.

Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.32. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.

The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is -0.85%.

“Politicians must not shirk their responsibility,” she added.

The Swiss parliament is due to meet in extraordinary session on Tuesday to discuss the state-sponsored rescue of Credit Suisse which took place last month.

UBS agreed to buy Zurich rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.31 billion) in a deal engineered by the government, the central bank and market regulator to avoid a meltdown in the country’s financial system.

“For the past three weeks, many of the approximately 17,000 employees at Credit Suisse and the 22,000 UBS employees have been looking at their future with uncertainty,” said Ferrara, referring to the staff numbers in Switzerland.

Credit Suisse employs 45,000 people globally, while UBS has 74,000 in total.

“In the public debate about the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, there is a lot of talk about numbers, money, regulation, ‘too big to fail’ or bonuses,” wrote Ferrara, whose organisation represents 6,000 workers in Switzerland.

“But the affected employees of the two banks remain only a side note. That needs to change.”

UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti last week warned there would be “change and hard decisions” ahead following the takeover.

The giant bank created could reduce its workforce by 20%-30%, it has been reported by Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger, with 11,000 jobs being cut in Switzerland.

UBS has said it is too early to speculate on job cuts.

Ferrara said it was not the fault of the bank employees that the rescue was required, adding it would take months for UBS’s plans to be worked out.

“Now it is time for the affected employees of the two banks to be given protection and respect,” Ferrara wrote in the letter that was first published by Swiss newspaper Blick on Tuesday.

“It must not be the case that parliament debates money and technical aspects of the CS rescue for days during the extraordinary session and the people affected are forgotten.”

The Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors on Friday said it has approved UBS Group’s acquisition of the U.S. subsidiaries of Credit Suisse, clearing another major hurdle for the completion of the Swiss-brokered rescue deal.

UBS has committed to give the U.S. central bank an implementation plan for combining its U.S. business and operations with those of Credit Suisse within three months of consummating the deal, the Fed’s Board said in a statement. The plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution, the statement said.

The U.S. central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

UBS had requested the Fed’s approval of the merger March 22, the Fed said.

After years of scandal and losses, 167-year-old Credit Suisse came to the brink of collapse before Zurich-based rival UBS rode to the rescue with a merger engineered and bankrolled by the Swiss authorities last month. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

The Swiss authorities and UBS Group AG have been racing to close the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG within as little as a month, in an effort to retain the lender’s clients and employees, Reuters previously reported.

UBS secured a temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, people familiar with the process told Reuters.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

The Fed subjects firms with more than $700 billion in assets, or more than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activities, to heightened supervision, including annual company-run stress tests and increased liquidity standards.

Shares of Credit Suisse (CS 1.05%) took a dive as it got swept in the global banking crisis and was forced to sell itself to UBS (UBS 1.29%) in a deal brokered by the Swiss government.

Credit Suisse is still publicly traded as the deal hasn't closed yet, but the stock fell sharply last month, losing 71%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

As you can see from the chart below, the stock fell sharply following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank as problems with Credit Suisse became apparent.

So what

Banking stocks were already falling on the exposure of problems at Silicon Valley Bank as rapidly rising interest rates have created challenges for banks that held long-duration bonds.

For Credit Suisse, chinks in its armor appeared in early March after one of its longest-standing shareholders sold its entire stake in the bank. It also delayed the publication of its annual report, and its head of regulatory compliance quit.

The stock then started to unravel after the bank said it found material weaknesses in its financial reporting. The following day the stock plunged again as its top shareholder, the Saudi National Bank, said it refused to buy any more of the stock, a sign it would no longer bail out the struggling bank.

Credit Suisse then asked the Swiss National Bank to step in and offer it a loan or another form of support, and the Swiss National Bank said it would offer it liquidity if necessary. The following day, on March 16, Credit Suisse borrowed 50 billion Swiss francs from the Swiss National Bank, and as the stock spiraled and the bank's untenable financial position became clear, a deal for UBS, another Swiss global, to take it over emerged brokered by the Swiss National Bank.

After back-and-forth offers from UBS, Credit Suisse agreed to sell itself to its rival for $3.3 billion and entered into the agreement on March 19.

Credit Suisse stock stabilized from there and closed out the month flat.

Now what

UBS is reportedly moving quickly to close the deal this month, and Credit Suisse stock was trading slightly above the buyout price, a sign that investors believe that the deal could change in their favor.

For Credit Suisse, the takeover could mean tens of thousands of layoffs and a major overhaul of its business. For investors, the deal seems likely to close with Credit Suisse stock trading where it is today.",['Jeremy Bowman'],2023-04-10 00:00:00
https://whtc.com/2023/04/13/blackrock-sells-asset-backed-bonds-from-credit-suisses-books-bloomberg-news/,BlackRock sells asset-backed bonds from Credit Suisse’s books- Bloomberg News,"(Reuters) – Credit Suisse Group AG has hired BlackRock Inc to help sell a portfolio of structured bonds for the Swiss bank, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.

BlackRock’s Financial Markets Advisory group has been selling off securities over the last two weeks, including pieces of collateralized loan obligations, commercial mortgage bonds and niche asset-backed debt, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

BlackRock declined to comment, while Credit Suisse did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The move comes after the Swiss lender was acquired by UBS Group AG in a state-brokered deal.

Earlier this month, U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) retained BlackRock’s unit to sell the securities portfolios it kept in receivership after the collapse of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank.

In March, law firm Pallas Partners told Reuters that they along with a Swiss council were working on possible legal action on behalf of some Credit Suisse AT1 bond investors whose holdings were wiped out following the bank’s takeover.

The Class Period was expanded to include more investors. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than May 8, 2023.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Credit Suisse securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Credit Suisse class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=12359 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than May 8, 2023. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) contrary to Defendant Lehmann's representations in December 2022, the sharp increase in customer outflows Credit Suisse began experiencing in October 2022 remained ongoing; (2) accordingly, Credit Suisse had downplayed the impact of the Company's recent series of quarterly losses and risk and compliance failures on liquidity and its ability to retain client funds; (3) as a result, Credit Suisse had overstated the Company's financial position and/or prospects; and (4) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

To join the Credit Suisse class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=12359 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Put together over a weekend, the legal and regulatory fall-out from the merger with UBS will take much longer.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Macquarie Group has hired Credit Suisse's top Australian dealmaker Dragi Ristevski, according to a memo from the bank.

Ristevski has been Credit Suisse's head of investment banking and capital markets. He will join Macquarie as the investment bank's head of financial sponsors for Asia Pacific, the memo said.

A Macquarie spokesman confirmed the contents of the memo.

https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/04/10/why-credit-suisse-stock-plunged-71-in-march/,Why Credit Suisse Stock Plunged 71% in March,"What happened

Shares of Credit Suisse (CS 1.05%) took a dive as it got swept in the global banking crisis and was forced to sell itself to UBS (UBS 1.29%) in a deal brokered by the Swiss government.

Credit Suisse is still publicly traded as the deal hasn't closed yet, but the stock fell sharply last month, losing 71%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

As you can see from the chart below, the stock fell sharply following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank as problems with Credit Suisse became apparent.

So what

Banking stocks were already falling on the exposure of problems at Silicon Valley Bank as rapidly rising interest rates have created challenges for banks that held long-duration bonds.

For Credit Suisse, chinks in its armor appeared in early March after one of its longest-standing shareholders sold its entire stake in the bank. It also delayed the publication of its annual report, and its head of regulatory compliance quit.

The stock then started to unravel after the bank said it found material weaknesses in its financial reporting. The following day the stock plunged again as its top shareholder, the Saudi National Bank, said it refused to buy any more of the stock, a sign it would no longer bail out the struggling bank.

Credit Suisse then asked the Swiss National Bank to step in and offer it a loan or another form of support, and the Swiss National Bank said it would offer it liquidity if necessary. The following day, on March 16, Credit Suisse borrowed 50 billion Swiss francs from the Swiss National Bank, and as the stock spiraled and the bank's untenable financial position became clear, a deal for UBS, another Swiss global, to take it over emerged brokered by the Swiss National Bank.

After back-and-forth offers from UBS, Credit Suisse agreed to sell itself to its rival for $3.3 billion and entered into the agreement on March 19.

Credit Suisse stock stabilized from there and closed out the month flat.

Now what

UBS is reportedly moving quickly to close the deal this month, and Credit Suisse stock was trading slightly above the buyout price, a sign that investors believe that the deal could change in their favor.

For Credit Suisse, the takeover could mean tens of thousands of layoffs and a major overhaul of its business. For investors, the deal seems likely to close with Credit Suisse stock trading where it is today.",['Jeremy Bowman'],2023-04-10 00:00:00

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-suisse-pays-back-emergency-101613470.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,"Credit Suisse pays back some emergency liquidity, central bank data suggests","ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse has already paid back some of the emergency liquidity offered by the Swiss National Bank (SNB), data suggested on Tuesday, signaling an ebbing of the liquidity crisis which triggered the lender's fall.

Sight deposits - cash held by commercial banks overnight with the SNB - fell by 31 billion Swiss francs ($34.3 billion)last week, data published by the central bank showed.

The drop was the second-biggest weekly decline on record, second only to when the SNB started mopping up market liquidity after it quit negative interest rates last September.

In recent weeks sight deposits have soared as Credit Suisse received emergency liquidity infusions to head off a bank run as nervous customers pulled out their cash.

The lender last month said it intended to borrow up to 50 billion francs from the SNB in a last-ditch attempt to save itself after confidence evaporated following a string of blunders.

Following a state-sponsored takeover by rival UBS, another 200 billion francs in liquidity was also made available by the SNB.

As a result sight deposits rose from 515 billion in mid March to peak at 567 billion francs as the SNB deposited the cash with Credit Suisse, an upward trend which reversed last week as sight deposits fell to 532 billion francs.

Credit Suisse, the SNB and UBS declined to comment on the development.

Karsten Junius, an economist at J.Safra Sarasin, said the decline could be attributed to Credit Suisse paying back some of the emergency liquidity it took and no longer needing to draw on the central bank support.

""Confidence in the bank has been restored by the UBS merger, and from this data it would appear customer outflows have stopped,"" Junius said.

""A bank run has been stopped by the SNB coming in and offering massive liquidity and customers are reassured by UBS being there too. Credit lines from other banks would also appear to have been re-established.""

The SNB may also have been active in forex markets, selling some of its foreign currencies to prop up the franc, an activity which would have seen sight deposits decline as the SNB received francs from commercial banks in return.

Story continues

But this was likely to be minor, Junius said, saying the SNB only sold foreign currencies worth 27 billion in the last three months of 2022.

""It's extremely unlikely the SNB sold more than 30 billion of forex just last week,"" Junius said. ""Confidence has been restored – the rescue seems to have done the trick. It seems to have been a successful operation.""

The National Council, through an unusual left-right alliance, voted twice over the last day to reject government guarantees authorized last month of 100 billion Swiss francs (about $110 billion) to help keep Credit Suisse afloat and 9 billion francs to help UBS mop up any losses it may incur in the deal.

The votes took place in a special parliamentary session that wrapped up Wednesday to scrutinize long-running troubles at Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old bank that was a pillar of Swiss finance, and the government plan to save it from a collapse that could have shaken the global financial system.

Switzerland's main right-wing party opposed tighter regulations on banks, while centrists favored tougher rules but would accept state help for banks in some cases. Left-leaning parties that have long decried ""overly dangerous"" banks were insistent on stricter limits on bonuses for top executives and requirements for more money to be kept on hand by the biggest lenders.

""The whole discussion centered on whether more regulation was needed — in particular to the leverage ratio — and severely regulate bonuses of the managers of the big, systemically important banks,"" Socialist lawmaker Roger Nordmann said.

Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter, who has been at the epicenter of a political firestorm around the 3 billion franc ($3.25 billion) Credit Suisse-UBS deal, told lawmakers that capital requirements would be increased — and ""you can start from the premise that big banks will face more severe restrictions.""

But Nordmann, who had questioned the minister on that issue, said by phone that Keller-Sutter hadn't presented any clear measures and was too noncommittal.

“That's an invitation for all dishonest bankers to come to Switzerland, and what we need is honest people,” he said.

The votes were symbolic because a parliamentary commission has already signed on to the emergency rescue plan that Swiss authorities orchestrated last month as shares of Credit Suisse sank and customers rushed to pull out their money. The failure of two U.S. banks just days before had sparked concerns about the stability of the Swiss lender and the global financial system.

Both the Swiss central bank and the government splashed out more than 200 billion Swiss francs in guarantees to help underpin the fusion of the country's top two banks and keep Credit Suisse from failing.

Parliament's upper house had voted Tuesday to accept the takeover plan announced March 19 by Switzerland’s seven-member executive branch — known as the Federal Council, which is headed by the Swiss president — as well as the Swiss National Bank and the financial markets regulator, FINMA.

Lawmakers in the upper house backed a plan that would have included limits to bonuses for bankers, but it didn't go far enough for the lower house.

For now, stricter legislative rules on Switzerland's biggest banks — led by UBS — are in limbo ahead of crucial elections for parliament this fall.

Sight deposits - cash held by commercial banks overnight with the SNB - fell by 31 billion Swiss francs ($34.3 billion)last week, data published by the central bank showed.

The drop was the second-biggest weekly decline on record, second only to when the SNB started mopping up market liquidity after it quit negative interest rates last September.

In recent weeks sight deposits have soared as Credit Suisse received emergency liquidity infusions to head off a bank run as nervous customers pulled out their cash.

The lender last month said it intended to borrow up to 50 billion francs from the SNB in a last-ditch attempt to save itself after confidence evaporated following a string of blunders.

Following a state-sponsored takeover by rival UBS, another 200 billion francs in liquidity was also made available by the SNB.

As a result sight deposits rose from 515 billion in mid March to peak at 567 billion francs as the SNB deposited the cash with Credit Suisse, an upward trend which reversed last week as sight deposits fell to 532 billion francs.

Credit Suisse, the SNB and UBS declined to comment on the development.

Karsten Junius, an economist at J.Safra Sarasin, said the decline could be attributed to Credit Suisse paying back some of the emergency liquidity it took and no longer needing to draw on the central bank support.

""Confidence in the bank has been restored by the UBS merger, and from this data it would appear customer outflows have stopped,"" Junius said.

""A bank run has been stopped by the SNB coming in and offering massive liquidity and customers are reassured by UBS being there too. Credit lines from other banks would also appear to have been re-established.""

The SNB may also have been active in forex markets, selling some of its foreign currencies to prop up the franc, an activity which would have seen sight deposits decline as the SNB received francs from commercial banks in return.

But this was likely to be minor, Junius said, saying the SNB only sold foreign currencies worth 27 billion in the last three months of 2022.

""It's extremely unlikely the SNB sold more than 30 billion of forex just last week,"" Junius said. ""Confidence has been restored – the rescue seems to have done the trick. It seems to have been a successful operation.""

The vote, above all, amounted to a rebuke of the executive branch at a time when Switzerland is gearing up for crucial legislative elections this fall.

The decision, which came after midnight, was largely symbolic because a parliamentary commission has already signed on to the rescue plan, which mostly involved guarantees through the Swiss central bank — not parliament.

There is no cost or obligation to you.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading minority and Woman-owned national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia.

As detailed below, the lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) contrary to Defendant Lehmann's representations in December 2022, the sharp increase in customer outflows Credit Suisse began experiencing in October 2022 remained ongoing; (2) accordingly, Credit Suisse had downplayed the impact of the Company's recent series of quarterly losses and risk and compliance failures on liquidity and its ability to retain client funds; (3) as a result, Credit Suisse had overstated the Company's financial position and/or prospects; and (4) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On February 9, 2023, Credit Suisse issued a press release announcing its 2022 financial results. The press release revealed that, contrary to Defendant Lehmann's prior statements, large customer outflows had continued through yearend 2022. Specifically, the press release reported customer outflows of 110.5 billion Swiss francs in the final three months of 2022, a figure which far exceeded market expectations.

On this news, Credit Suisse's ADS price fell $0.56 per ADS, or 15.64%, to close at $3.02 per ADS on February 9, 2023.

Then, on February 21, 2023, Reuters reported that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (""FINMA""), was reviewing Defendant Lehmann's previous comments regarding customer outflows.

On this news, Credit Suisse's ADS price fell another $0.10 per ADS, or 3.31%, to close at $2.92 per ADS on February 21, 2023.

As a result of Defendants' wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company's securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Creedit Suisse's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/apr/12/credit-suisse-rescue-rebuked-by-switzerlands-lower/,Credit Suisse rescue rebuked by half of Swiss parliament,"GENEVA — Switzerland‘s lower house of parliament issued a searing - though symbolic - rebuke Wednesday of an emergency plan spearheaded by the executive branch to prop up embattled Credit Suisse and shepherd it into a takeover by Swiss banking rival UBS.

The National Council, through an unusual left-right alliance, voted 102 to 71 to reject government guarantees authorized last month of 100 billion Swiss francs (about $110 billion) to help keep Credit Suisse afloat and 9 billion francs to help UBS mop up any losses it may incur in the takeover.

The vote took place as part of a three-day special parliamentary session that opened Tuesday to scrutinize long-running troubles at Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old bank that was a pillar of Swiss finance, and the plan to save it from a collapse that could have had major implications for the global financial system.

The vote, above all, amounted to a rebuke of the executive branch at a time when Switzerland is gearing up for crucial legislative elections this fall.

The decision, which came after midnight, was largely symbolic because a parliamentary commission has already signed on to the rescue plan, which mostly involved guarantees through the Swiss central bank - not parliament.

Swiss authorities stepped in to orchestrate the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.25 billion) fusion of Switzerland’s top two banks as shares of Credit Suisse sank last month and customers pulled their money out after the failure of two U.S. banks sparked concerns about the stability of the Swiss lender and the global financial system.

Earlier, Switzerland‘s upper house of parliament voted to accept the takeover plan announced March 19 by Switzerland’s seven-member executive branch - known as the Federal Council, which is headed by the Swiss president - as well as the Swiss National Bank and the Swiss financial markets regulator, FINMA.

Further debate Wednesday was expected to center on ironing out differences between the two chambers of parliament.","['The Washington Times Https', 'Jamey Keaten']",2023-04-12 00:00:00

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-suisse-sec-letters-show-173338093.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,"Credit Suisse, SEC letters show months-long reporting errors debate","By Chris Prentice

NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) engaged in a months-long debate over the severity of reporting deficiencies that led the Swiss bank to delay its annual report last month.

Credit Suisse said in March it had postponed the annual filing after a ""late call"" with the regulator which raised questions about earlier financial statements.

Correspondence published in the SEC's online database on Tuesday show that agency staff first raised questions with Credit Suisse officials in July 2022.

Credit Suisse and the SEC declined to comment.

At issue were changes Credit Suisse made to how it booked a series of cash flows, including share-based compensation and foreign exchange hedges, and if control deficiencies needed to be disclosed to its audit committee or escalated to investors.

""Management believes it is prudent to briefly delay the publication of its accounts in order to understand more thoroughly the comments received,"" Credit Suisse said at the time of the delay on March 9.

The last-minute delay concerned analysts and sent Credit Suisse shares to near an all-time low. The back-and-forth between the bank and the U.S. regulator extended into another week as turmoil gripped the banking sector.

As recently as March 10, the SEC asked the bank to explain how it decided that an ""entity-level material weakness did not exist"" for its 2021 and 2022 financial years.

Material weaknesses are considered the most serious of such control failures. In previous letters to the SEC in August and November, Credit Suisse's former chief financial officer David Mathers and his successor Dixit Joshi described the failings as ""deficiencies"", which are considered to be less serious.

In the March 10 letter to Joshi, SEC staff acknowledged discussions with the bank on March 8-10. Joshi responded on March 12, saying in a letter that the firm noted the concerns and had reassessed its position.

Story continues

""We will report that we have, and have had, a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting..."" he said in the letter posted on the SEC online database.

Credit Suisse notified shareholders of the weaknesses in its annual report on March 14, the day before it was granted a liquidity lifeline by the Swiss National Bank.

This proved insufficient and on March 19, the bank's takeover by Swiss rival UBS was announced.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-suisse-pays-back-emergency-101338511.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,"Credit Suisse pays back some emergency liquidity, central bank data suggests","ZURICH, April 11 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse has already paid back some of the emergency liquidity offered by the Swiss National Bank (SNB), data suggested on Tuesday, signaling an ebbing of the liquidity crisis which triggered the lender's fall.

Sight deposits - cash held by commercial banks overnight with the SNB - fell by 31 billion Swiss francs ($34.3 billion)last week, data published by the central bank showed.

The drop was the second-biggest weekly decline on record, second only to when the SNB started mopping up market liquidity after it quit negative interest rates last September.

In recent weeks sight deposits have soared as Credit Suisse received emergency liquidity infusions to head off a bank run as nervous customers pulled out their cash.

The lender last month said it intended to borrow up to 50 billion francs from the SNB in a last-ditch attempt to save itself after confidence evaporated following a string of blunders.

Following a state-sponsored takeover by rival UBS, another 200 billion francs in liquidity was also made available by the SNB.

As a result sight deposits rose from 515 billion in mid March to peak at 567 billion francs as the SNB deposited the cash with Credit Suisse, an upward trend which reversed last week as sight deposits fell to 532 billion francs.

Credit Suisse, the SNB and UBS declined to comment on the development.

Karsten Junius, an economist at J.Safra Sarasin, said the decline could be attributed to Credit Suisse paying back some of the emergency liquidity it took and no longer needing to draw on the central bank support.

""Confidence in the bank has been restored by the UBS merger, and from this data it would appear customer outflows have stopped,"" Junius said.

""A bank run has been stopped by the SNB coming in and offering massive liquidity and customers are reassured by UBS being there too. Credit lines from other banks would also appear to have been re-established.""

Story continues

The SNB may also have been active in forex markets, selling some of its foreign currencies to prop up the franc, an activity which would have seen sight deposits decline as the SNB received francs from commercial banks in return.

But this was likely to be minor, Junius said, saying the SNB only sold foreign currencies worth 27 billion in the last three months of 2022.

""It's extremely unlikely the SNB sold more than 30 billion of forex just last week,"" Junius said. ""Confidence has been restored – the rescue seems to have done the trick. It seems to have been a successful operation.""

GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland’s lower house of parliament issued a searing — though symbolic — rebuke Wednesday of an emergency plan spearheaded by the executive branch to prop up embattled Credit Suisse and shepherd it into a takeover by Swiss banking rival UBS.

The National Council, through an unusual left-right alliance, voted twice over the last day to reject government guarantees authorized last month of 100 billion Swiss francs (about $110 billion) to help keep Credit Suisse afloat and 9 billion francs to help UBS mop up any losses it may incur in the deal.

The votes took place in a special parliamentary session that wrapped up Wednesday to scrutinize long-running troubles at Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old bank that was a pillar of Swiss finance, and the government plan to save it from a collapse that could have shaken the global financial system.

Switzerland’s main right-wing party opposed tighter regulations on banks, while centrists favored tougher rules but would accept state help for banks in some cases. Left-leaning parties that have long decried “overly dangerous” banks were insistent on stricter limits on bonuses for top executives and requirements for more money to be kept on hand by the biggest lenders.

“The whole discussion centered on whether more regulation was needed — in particular to the leverage ratio — and severely regulate bonuses of the managers of the big, systemically important banks,” Socialist lawmaker Roger Nordmann said.

Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter, who has been at the epicenter of a political firestorm around the 3 billion franc ($3.25 billion) Credit Suisse-UBS deal, told lawmakers that capital requirements would be increased — and “you can start from the premise that big banks will face more severe restrictions.”

But Nordmann, who had questioned the minister on that issue, said by phone that Keller-Sutter hadn’t presented any clear measures and was too noncommittal.

“That’s an invitation for all dishonest bankers to come to Switzerland, and what we need is honest people,” he said.

The votes were symbolic because a parliamentary commission has already signed on to the emergency rescue plan that Swiss authorities orchestrated last month as shares of Credit Suisse sank and customers rushed to pull out their money. The failure of two U.S. banks just days before had sparked concerns about the stability of the Swiss lender and the global financial system.

Both the Swiss central bank and the government splashed out more than 200 billion Swiss francs in guarantees to help underpin the fusion of the country’s top two banks and keep Credit Suisse from failing.

Parliament’s upper house had voted Tuesday to accept the takeover plan announced March 19 by Switzerland’s seven-member executive branch — known as the Federal Council, which is headed by the Swiss president — as well as the Swiss National Bank and the financial markets regulator, FINMA.

Lawmakers in the upper house backed a plan that would have included limits to bonuses for bankers, but it didn’t go far enough for the lower house.

For now, stricter legislative rules on Switzerland’s biggest banks — led by UBS — are in limbo ahead of crucial elections for parliament this fall.

https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ecb-told-not-take-banks-word-it-when-assessing-risk-2023-04-17/,ECB told not to take banks' word for it when assessing risk,"













FRANKFURT, April 17 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank should stop relying on banks' self-assessments when setting capital requirements and do its own homework instead, independent experts said on Monday.

It was the most notable recommendation in a report commissioned by the ECB to evaluate its work on the key task as the euro zone's top financial supervisor, namely to decide how much capital banks must have to absorb losses.

The review was launched in September, well before problems at Silicon Valley Bank in the United States and Switzerland's Credit Suisse raised questions about banking watchdogs. But its findings chime with recent calls for tougher checks.

The ECB has been blending its analysis with the banks' own to come up with capital requirements.

But the five experts - all former bank supervisors from Japan, the United States, Ireland, Spain and Canada, respectively - said this approach was ""conceptually weak"" and banks' own Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) was often biased, so it shouldn't be relied upon.

""Banks’ self-evaluations are often subject to biases that may become even more significant when ICAAPs play a prominent role in the determination of P2R (Pillar 2 requirements),"" the experts said in the report, referring to the second of three tiers of bank capital requirements set under global rules.

""ICAAPs should be used as ancillary information, rather than the basis for the analysis.""

They told the ECB to change the way it sets capital demands and focus ""on specific risks requiring additional capital coverage, while significantly limiting the use of ICAAPs"".

The ECB's top supervisor Andrea Enria said the recommendations strengthened his ""conviction that supervision needs to become more adaptable, intrusive and risk-focused"".

Fellow ECB supervisor Elizabeth McCaul welcomed a recommendation to use more ""qualitative measures"" with banks, which she said could include ""limitations on business activity, demanding changes in the board and management, and monetary sanctions"".

Euro zone banks have come out unscathed from the recent turmoil in the banking sector, with Enria recently saying they were solid, also thanks to stricter rules in the European Union than in the United States.

Still, in a podcast published on Monday, Germany's central banker Joachim Nagel said recent events should spur supervisors to address the ""black spots"" in their vision.

By Hannah Lang, Chris Prentice and Ann Saphir

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's Board of Governors on Friday said it has approved UBS Group AG's acquisition of the U.S. subsidiaries of Credit Suisse, clearing another major hurdle for the completion of the Swiss-brokered rescue deal.

UBS has committed to give the U.S. central bank an implementation plan for combining its U.S. business and operations with those of Credit Suisse within three months of consummating the deal, the Fed's Board said in a statement. The plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution, the statement said.

The U.S. central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

UBS had requested the Fed's approval of the merger March 22, the Fed said.

After years of scandal and losses, 167-year-old Credit Suisse came to the brink of collapse before Zurich-based rival UBS rode to the rescue with a merger engineered and bankrolled by the Swiss authorities last month. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

The Swiss authorities and UBS Group AG have been racing to close the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG within as little as a month, in an effort to retain the lender's clients and employees, Reuters previously reported.

UBS secured a temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, people familiar with the process told Reuters.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

The Fed subjects firms with more than $700 billion in assets, or more than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activities, to heightened supervision, including annual company-run stress tests and increased liquidity standards.

By John Revill and Noele Illien

ZURICH/BERN (Reuters) - Switzerland's tradition of dependable consensus politics has taken a battering after the government used an emergency law to push through a state-backed mega-merger of UBS and Credit Suisse, sidelining the country's parliament.

Switzerland's two parliamentary chambers voted to reject the government's 109 billion Swiss francs ($122.82 billion) in aid for the deal between the country's two biggest banks, delivering a slap in the face for government.

The defeat is symbolic as it cannot change the merger, but it is a blow for the government in an election year and makes it harder to build broad support among the population for the biggest corporate rescue in Swiss history.

The use of emergency laws, in which shareholders and parliamentarians have no say, will also damage the standing of Switzerland's financial industry abroad, analysts have said, especially as it faces rising competition from other financial centres like Singapore.

The Swiss political model is under pressure at the moment, said political scientist Michael Hermann, a director of pollsters Sotomo, adding that the foreign perception of Switzerland as business friendly and as a financial safe haven could be undermined.

""Legitimacy in Swiss politics has been weakened, People who worried about an over powerful government during COVID will see their fears confirmed,"" said Hermann.

""This is damaging for the trust in democracy – parliament says no, but the emergency credits still go through.""

A recent Sotomo poll showed two thirds of the population was against the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse, while a third of respondents were angry that emergency laws had been used to bypass parliament.

The affair has already boosted support for populist right wing groups like the anti-immigrant Swiss People's Party (SVP) and the libertarian Aufrecht Schweiz movement in local elections since the takeover. Both parties are looking to make gains in national elections in October.

PARLIAMENT 'CIRCUMVENTED'

The Credit Suisse/UBS merger marked the first time that parliament had withheld its support for emergency laws designed to deal quickly with crises.

The facility to act without parliamentary approval, introduced in 2000, was used during the COVID pandemic to enforce restrictions and again last year to provide a Swiss energy producer with a credit line.

In the lead-up to the UBS/Credit Suisse merger last month, Swiss emergency law allowed a sub-group of six members of parliament to approve a cabinet plan to give financial aid on behalf of the legislative body, angering the almost 250 lawmakers, who were left without a say.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter defended the use of the emergency powers, saying Switzerland was not an ""emergency dictatorship.""

""We don't do it for fun. We really didn't know what else to do,"" Keller-Sutter told parliament during a stormy emergency session this week. ""The emergency law is based on the federal constitution and I don't think it's correct to say it's illegal.""

Lawmakers were dismayed.

""It has not been a great moment for Swiss democracy. It is terrible parliament has been put in this position and basically circumvented,"" said Roger Nordmann, leader of the Social Democrat group in the Swiss lower house told Reuters.

The Swiss government said it would take into account the rejection by parliament, but stressed the success of the takeover of Switzerland's second biggest bank - intended to prevent a financial meltdown - was paramount.

Industry experts said the deal was unlikely to be changed by politicians, with UBS being given a free hand to determine how many jobs will go and what will be done with Credit Suisse's valuable domestic retail banking business.

Swiss media has reported that the takeover could result in the combined bank cutting its Swiss workforce by up to 30%, which could cost 11,000 jobs.

""Despite the anger, most policy-makers do not want to interfere in the merger, to create and bear the risk that the merger does not succeed,"" said Hans Gersbach, co-director of the KOF economic research institute at ETH Zurich.

""Politicians might have wanted to show their disapproval about what happened, but they don’t want the UBS takeover to fail.""

Ultimately, 209 billion Swiss francs are being provided as state and central bank guarantees and support in the plan drawn up by the seven-strong Swiss cabinet, which has members from four political parties.

The amount is equivalent to around a quarter of Switzerland's entire economic output, and includes emergency liquidity injections and a state pledge to absorb up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS, based on documents outlining the deal.

Peter Kunz, an expert in economic law at the University of Bern, said the lawmakers were ultimately powerless to change it.

""In Switzerland, we often pat ourselves on the back for having the oldest democracy in the world. Yet seven people decided on 250 billion francs of support, an unimaginably huge sum of money,"" he said.

""And the parliament has no say in the matter. The use of such emergency legislation, overturning antitrust rules, is a problem for Swiss democracy and rule of law. It calls Swiss democracy into question.""

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's Board of Governors on Friday said it has approved UBS Group AG's acquisition of the U.S. subsidiaries of Credit Suisse, clearing another major hurdle for the completion of the Swiss-brokered rescue deal.

UBS has committed to give the U.S. central bank an implementation plan for combining its U.S. business and operations with those of Credit Suisse within three months of consummating the deal, the Fed's Board said in a statement. The plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution, the statement said.

The U.S. central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

UBS had requested the Fed's approval of the merger March 22, the Fed said.

After years of scandal and losses, 167-year-old Credit Suisse came to the brink of collapse before Zurich-based rival UBS rode to the rescue with a merger engineered and bankrolled by the Swiss authorities last month. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

The Swiss authorities and UBS Group AG have been racing to close the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG within as little as a month, in an effort to retain the lender's clients and employees, Reuters previously reported.

UBS secured a temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, people familiar with the process told Reuters.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

The Fed subjects firms with more than $700 billion in assets, or more than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activities, to heightened supervision, including annual company-run stress tests and increased liquidity standards.

The plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution, the statement said.

The U.S. central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers that would create an institution with total assets of more than $250 billion. The Fed’s approval of UBS’s application clears a key hurdle for the shotgun merger between the two banks orchestrated last month by the Swiss central bank. After years of scandal and losses, 167-year-old Credit Suisse came to the brink of collapse before Zurich-based rival UBS rode to the rescue with a merger engineered and bankrolled by the Swiss authorities last month. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value. UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets. Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion. The Fed subjects firms with more than $700 billion in assets, or more than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activities, to heightened supervision, including annual company-run stress tests and increased liquidity standards.

CREDIT SUISSE'S ALLEGED MISCONDUCT

On March 10, 2022, Credit Suisse filed with the SEC its 2021 annual report on a Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 2021 annual report failed to identify any material weaknesses with Credit Suisse's internal controls.

On December 1, 2022, Credit Suisse's Chairman, Axel P. Lehmann (""Lehmann"") stated in an interview with Financial Times that customer outflows had not only ""completely flattened out,"" but had, in fact, ""partially reversed."" The following day, in an interview with Bloomberg Television, Lehmann reiterated his previous statements, reassuring investors that as of November 11, 2022, customer outflows had ""basically stopped."" Following Lehmann's statements, Credit Suisse's American Depository Share (""ADS"") price rose $0.29 per ADS, or 9.36%, to close at $3.38 per ADS on December 2, 2022.

Then on February 9, 2023, Credit Suisse issued a press release announcing its 2022 financial results. The press release revealed that, contrary to Lehmann's prior statements, large customer outflows had continued through year-end 2022. Specifically, the press release reported customer outflows of 110.5 billion Swiss francs in the final three months of 2022, a figure which far exceeded market expectations. Following this news, Credit Suisse's ADS price fell $0.56 per ADS, or 15.64%, to close at $3.02 per ADS on February 9, 2023.

On February 21, 2023, Reuters reported that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority was reviewing Lehmann's previous comments regarding customer outflows. Following this news, Credit Suisse's ADS price fell another $0.10 per ADS, or 3.31%, to close at $2.92 per ADS on February 21, 2023.

Then on Tuesday, March 14, 2023, Credit Suisse issued its annual 2022 report and revealed that it had identified ""certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting"" for the years 2021 and 2022. Additionally, on Wednesday, March 15, 2023, the chairman of Credit Suisse's largest shareholder, Saudi National Bank, which holds 9.88% of Credit Suisse, announced that it won't provide further financial support to Credit Suisse and that it would not buy more shares on regulatory grounds.

Following this news, the price of Credit Suisse ADSs fell 13.94% to close at $2.16 per ADS on March 15, 2023.

Finally, on March 20, 2023, Credit Suisse issued an announcement on Form 6-K of its merger agreement with Union Bank of Switzerland and that Union Bank of Switzerland would be the surviving entity upon closing of the merger transaction.

Following this news, the price of Credit Suisse ADSs fell 52.99% to close at $0.9450 per ADS on March 20, 2023.

WHAT CAN I DO?

Credit Suisse investors may, move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff for the class, through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

https://www.ibtimes.com/analysis-emergency-credit-suisse-rescue-shakes-faith-switzerland-3686042,Analysis-Emergency Credit Suisse Rescue Shakes Faith In Switzerland,"Switzerland's tradition of dependable consensus politics has taken a battering after the government used an emergency law to push through a state-backed mega-merger of UBS and Credit Suisse, sidelining the country's parliament.

Switzerland's two parliamentary chambers voted to reject the government's 109 billion Swiss francs ($122.82 billion) in aid for the deal between the country's two biggest banks, delivering a slap in the face for government.

The defeat is symbolic as it cannot change the merger, but it is a blow for the government in an election year and makes it harder to build broad support among the population for the biggest corporate rescue in Swiss history.

The use of emergency laws, in which shareholders and parliamentarians have no say, will also damage the standing of Switzerland's financial industry abroad, analysts have said, especially as it faces rising competition from other financial centres like Singapore.

The Swiss political model is under pressure at the moment, said political scientist Michael Hermann, a director of pollsters Sotomo, adding that the foreign perception of Switzerland as business friendly and as a financial safe haven could be undermined.

""Legitimacy in Swiss politics has been weakened, People who worried about an over powerful government during COVID will see their fears confirmed,"" said Hermann.

""This is damaging for the trust in democracy - parliament says no, but the emergency credits still go through.""

A recent Sotomo poll showed two thirds of the population was against the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse, while a third of respondents were angry that emergency laws had been used to bypass parliament.

The affair has already boosted support for populist right wing groups like the anti-immigrant Swiss People's Party (SVP) and the libertarian Aufrecht Schweiz movement in local elections since the takeover. Both parties are looking to make gains in national elections in October.

PARLIAMENT 'CIRCUMVENTED'

The Credit Suisse/UBS merger marked the first time that parliament had withheld its support for emergency laws designed to deal quickly with crises.

The facility to act without parliamentary approval, introduced in 2000, was used during the COVID pandemic to enforce restrictions and again last year to provide a Swiss energy producer with a credit line.

In the lead-up to the UBS/Credit Suisse merger last month, Swiss emergency law allowed a sub-group of six members of parliament to approve a cabinet plan to give financial aid on behalf of the legislative body, angering the almost 250 lawmakers, who were left without a say.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter defended the use of the emergency powers, saying Switzerland was not an ""emergency dictatorship.""

""We don't do it for fun. We really didn't know what else to do,"" Keller-Sutter told parliament during a stormy emergency session this week. ""The emergency law is based on the federal constitution and I don't think it's correct to say it's illegal.""

Lawmakers were dismayed.

""It has not been a great moment for Swiss democracy. It is terrible parliament has been put in this position and basically circumvented,"" said Roger Nordmann, leader of the Social Democrat group in the Swiss lower house told Reuters.

The Swiss government said it would take into account the rejection by parliament, but stressed the success of the takeover of Switzerland's second biggest bank - intended to prevent a financial meltdown - was paramount.

Industry experts said the deal was unlikely to be changed by politicians, with UBS being given a free hand to determine how many jobs will go and what will be done with Credit Suisse's valuable domestic retail banking business.

Swiss media has reported that the takeover could result in the combined bank cutting its Swiss workforce by up to 30%, which could cost 11,000 jobs.

""Despite the anger, most policy-makers do not want to interfere in the merger, to create and bear the risk that the merger does not succeed,"" said Hans Gersbach, co-director of the KOF economic research institute at ETH Zurich.

""Politicians might have wanted to show their disapproval about what happened, but they don't want the UBS takeover to fail.""

Ultimately, 209 billion Swiss francs are being provided as state and central bank guarantees and support in the plan drawn up by the seven-strong Swiss cabinet, which has members from four political parties.

The amount is equivalent to around a quarter of Switzerland's entire economic output, and includes emergency liquidity injections and a state pledge to absorb up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS, based on documents outlining the deal.

Peter Kunz, an expert in economic law at the University of Bern, said the lawmakers were ultimately powerless to change it.

""In Switzerland, we often pat ourselves on the back for having the oldest democracy in the world. Yet seven people decided on 250 billion francs of support, an unimaginably huge sum of money,"" he said.

""And the parliament has no say in the matter. The use of such emergency legislation, overturning antitrust rules, is a problem for Swiss democracy and rule of law. It calls Swiss democracy into question.""

""Despite the anger, most policy-makers do not want to interfere in the merger, to create and bear the risk that the merger does not succeed,"" said Hans Gersbach, co-director of the KOF economic research institute at ETH Zurich.

""Politicians might have wanted to show their disapproval about what happened, but they don’t want the UBS takeover to fail.""

Ultimately, 209 billion Swiss francs are being provided as state and central bank guarantees and support in the plan drawn up by the seven-strong Swiss cabinet, which has members from four political parties.

The amount is equivalent to around a quarter of Switzerland's entire economic output, and includes emergency liquidity injections and a state pledge to absorb up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS, based on documents outlining the deal.

Peter Kunz, an expert in economic law at the University of Bern, said the lawmakers were ultimately powerless to change it.

""In Switzerland, we often pat ourselves on the back for having the oldest democracy in the world. Yet seven people decided on 250 billion francs of support, an unimaginably huge sum of money,"" he said.

""And the parliament has no say in the matter. The use of such emergency legislation, overturning antitrust rules, is a problem for Swiss democracy and rule of law. It calls Swiss democracy into question.""

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mufg-clients-lost-700-million-090125498.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,MUFG Clients Lost $700 Million in Credit Suisse AT1 Wipeout,"(Bloomberg) -- Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.’s wealthy clients lost more than $700 million on Credit Suisse Group AG’s riskiest bonds purchased through the Japanese bank’s brokerage venture with Morgan Stanley, according to people familiar with the matter.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Japan’s largest banking group is holding meetings of senior officials to look into the matter as it reaches out to roughly 1,500 clients who lost a combined 95 billion yen ($717 million), said the people, who asked not to be named discussing private information.

While MUFG is hardly the only firm to get caught up in the Credit Suisse debacle, the loss tally offers one of the first glimpses into how badly clients of a major investment bank were burned by the writedown. The Credit Suisse bonds, known as Additional Tier 1 notes, were purchased by customers from Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co.

A spokesperson for the bank confirmed the losses.

Other Lenders

A representative for Mizuho Financial Group Inc.’s brokerage unit said its clients have lost more than 4 billion yen on Credit Suisse AT1s. Daiwa Securities Group Inc.’s client lost less than 1 billion yen on the instruments, according to a spokesperson.

A representative for Nomura Holdings Inc. said it hadn’t sold any of the Swiss lender’s AT1s in Japan. A spokesperson for SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. declined to comment.

MUFG is also checking that wealth managers at the brokerage - one of the two joint ventures between the Japanese institution and the Wall Street giant - appropriately explained to the buyers the risks associated with the debt, the spokesperson said.

The development illustrates how the fallout from Credit Suisse’s rescue by rival UBS Group AG and the resulting wipeout of about 16 billion Swiss francs ($18 billion) of its AT1 bonds is being felt across global finance. The deal to save the bank rendered the notes worthless, allowing Credit Suisse shareholders to recoup some value.

Story continues

The AT1 notes were risky and designed to be written down in the event of Credit Suisse needing capital in a hurry. Some holders argue that they were treated unfairly and are looking for legal remedies.

Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley has been working to boost profit through wealth management services in Japan, where banks have been increasingly competing to manage a larger slice of the nation’s roughly 2 quadrillion yen in household financial assets.

“We are very sorry that we are causing our clients concern,” Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley said by email. “We will continue to offer thorough explanations to the customers who have been affected.”

By Hannah Lang, Chris Prentice and Ann Saphir

(Reuters) -The Federal Reserve's Board of Governors on Friday said it has approved UBS Group AG's acquisition of the U.S. subsidiaries of Credit Suisse, clearing another major hurdle for the completion of the Swiss-brokered rescue deal.

UBS has committed to give the U.S. central bank an implementation plan for combining its U.S. business and operations with those of Credit Suisse within three months of consummating the deal, the Fed's Board said in a statement. The plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution, the statement said.

The U.S. central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers that would create an institution with total assets of more than $250 billion.

After years of scandal and losses, 167-year-old Credit Suisse came to the brink of collapse before Zurich-based rival UBS rode to the rescue with a merger engineered and bankrolled by the Swiss authorities last month. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

The Swiss authorities and UBS Group AG have been racing to close the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG within as little as a month, in an effort to retain the lender's clients and employees, Reuters previously reported.

UBS secured a temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, people familiar with the process told Reuters.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

The Fed subjects firms with more than $700 billion in assets, or more than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activities, to heightened supervision, including annual company-run stress tests and increased liquidity standards.

BERN (Reuters) -Switzerland's parliament rejected on Wednesday the government's 109 billion Swiss francs ($120.82 billion) aid for Credit Suisse's merger with UBS, leaving the fallen bank's hastily arranged rescue without a largely symbolic parliamentary blessing.

While the upper house had approved the government's contribution to the rescue package, parliament's lower, and larger chamber, pushed back again on Wednesday.

It had already rejected the proposals in a late night session on Tuesday, forcing the upper house to find a solution when it met again on Wednesday.

Seeking a compromise, the upper house passed changes to the measure on Wednesday morning, but it was not enough to sway the lower house lawmakers.

Political Cartoons on World Leaders View All 208 Images

They turned it down by 103 votes to 71 in favour, a similar level of opposition to the night before.

Speaking just before the lower house vote, Cedric Wermuth, the co-president of the Social Democrats said the party just could not support the funding.

While the government's commitment, made using emergency law, cannot be overturned, the vote marks a symbolic rebuke for the authorities, whose decision to largely bypass the nation's legislative has angered many politicians.

""This decision has no impact on the takeover of Credit Suisse decided on March 19,"" the Swiss Finance Ministry said after the vote.

The support package had already been given binding approval by the parliament's finance delegation, due to the urgency of the matter, it said.

""The funds have already been fully committed,"" it added.

Lawmakers who backed an approval of the deal, voiced concern about Switzerland's image.

""It doesn't really matter what we decide in detail, but it would really send a bad signal if these loans were rejected,"" said Eva Herzog, who is a member of the Council of States, the upper house, before the vote.

Following a day of heated debates held in the country's four national languages, that continued into early morning hours, the upper house passed changes aimed at winning over the sceptics.

They included a proposal for Switzerland's federal government to draft an amendment to the country's Banking Act. Its aim would be to reduce the risks posed by systemically relevant banks, such as Credit Suisse and UBS for Switzerland, by, for example, raising capital requirements and restricting bonuses.

Addressing parliament before the vote on Wednesday, finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter told lawmakers to consider what message their rejection of the rescue would send to the world.

""What signal do you want to give internationally, are the institutions reliable, do you value financial market stability in a place where you already have a financial centre with a certain importance?""

Lawmakers were recalled to the country's capital, Bern, for the rare extraordinary session to discuss the Swiss government's open chequebook response to a collapse that many in the country have blamed on Credit Suisse's top management.

Last month's shotgun marriage which saw the bank taken over by rival UBS for 3 billion Swiss francs and propped up with more than 250 billion Swiss francs in guarantees and support has drawn widespread criticism.

The government invoked Swiss emergency law to sign it off to the ire of the almost 250 lawmakers left without a say.

""The use of emergency law has reached a level in the last three years that is beginning to annoy me,"" Hansjoerg Knecht, a member of Parliament's upper house, said on Tuesday.

ZURICH/BERN (Reuters) -Switzerland's tradition of dependable consensus politics has taken a battering after the government used an emergency law to push through a state-backed mega-merger of UBS and Credit Suisse, sidelining the country's parliament.

Switzerland's two parliamentary chambers voted to reject the government's 109 billion Swiss francs ($122.82 billion) in aid for the deal between the country's two biggest banks, delivering a slap in the face for government.

The defeat is symbolic as it cannot change the merger, but it is a blow for the government in an election year and makes it harder to build broad support among the population for the biggest corporate rescue in Swiss history.

The use of emergency laws, in which shareholders and parliamentarians have no say, will also damage the standing of Switzerland's financial industry abroad, analysts have said, especially as it faces rising competition from other financial centres like Singapore.

The Swiss political model is under pressure at the moment, said political scientist Michael Hermann, a director of pollsters Sotomo, adding that the foreign perception of Switzerland as business friendly and as a financial safe haven could be undermined.

""Legitimacy in Swiss politics has been weakened, People who worried about an over powerful government during COVID will see their fears confirmed,"" said Hermann.

""This is damaging for the trust in democracy – parliament says no, but the emergency credits still go through.""

A recent Sotomo poll showed two thirds of the population was against the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse, while a third of respondents were angry that emergency laws had been used to bypass parliament.

The affair has already boosted support for populist right wing groups like the anti-immigrant Swiss People's Party (SVP) and the libertarian Aufrecht Schweiz movement in local elections since the takeover. Both parties are looking to make gains in national elections in October.

PARLIAMENT 'CIRCUMVENTED'

The Credit Suisse/UBS merger marked the first time that parliament had withheld its support for emergency laws designed to deal quickly with crises.

The facility to act without parliamentary approval, introduced in 2000, was used during the COVID pandemic to enforce restrictions and again last year to provide a Swiss energy producer with a credit line.

In the lead-up to the UBS/Credit Suisse merger last month, Swiss emergency law allowed a sub-group of six members of parliament to approve a cabinet plan to give financial aid on behalf of the legislative body, angering the almost 250 lawmakers, who were left without a say.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter defended the use of the emergency powers, saying Switzerland was not an ""emergency dictatorship.""

""We don't do it for fun. We really didn't know what else to do,"" Keller-Sutter told parliament during a stormy emergency session this week. ""The emergency law is based on the federal constitution and I don't think it's correct to say it's illegal.""

Lawmakers were dismayed.

""It has not been a great moment for Swiss democracy. It is terrible parliament has been put in this position and basically circumvented,"" said Roger Nordmann, leader of the Social Democrat group in the Swiss lower house told Reuters.

The Swiss government said it would take into account the rejection by parliament, but stressed the success of the takeover of Switzerland's second biggest bank - intended to prevent a financial meltdown - was paramount.

Industry experts said the deal was unlikely to be changed by politicians, with UBS being given a free hand to determine how many jobs will go and what will be done with Credit Suisse's valuable domestic retail banking business.

Swiss media has reported that the takeover could result in the combined bank cutting its Swiss workforce by up to 30%, which could cost 11,000 jobs.

""Despite the anger, most policy-makers do not want to interfere in the merger, to create and bear the risk that the merger does not succeed,"" said Hans Gersbach, co-director of the KOF economic research institute at ETH Zurich.

Swiss lawmakers gather to discuss Credit Suisse rescue

*

Frustration grows over use of state funds

*

Lawmakers protest but cannot overturn deal

By Noele Illien and John Revill

BERN, April 11 (Reuters) - Since Switzerland's authorities last month pulled out all the stops to rush through a rescue of Credit Suisse, a storm has been brewing in the normally tranquil country.

Many Swiss parliamentarians have criticised the shotgun marriage, which saw Credit Suisse taken over by rival UBS for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion) and propped up with over 250 billion francs in guarantees and support.

On Tuesday, they will meet in Bern for an extraordinary session to discuss Credit Suisse's downfall as well as the government's open chequebook response.

The unusual event - the third such session in over twenty years - provides parliament with a chance to reject the massive loans given as part of the rescue package.

The vote is, however, largely symbolic as the state has already committed the funds and lawmakers cannot overturn that decision.

In the lead-up to the announced merger, a sub-group of six members of parliament approved the financial commitment on behalf of the legislative body, to the ire of the almost 250 lawmakers left without a say.

""It's the responsibility of politics to have a say especially when such a big contribution is being made by state and emergency law is being used,"" said Celine Widmer, a member of the Swiss National Council for the left-leaning Social Democrats.

“We have a lots of questions that need to be answered,"" she told Reuters.

""There is a lot of anger and frustration in the Swiss population and we can feel that,"" said Roland Fischer, another lawmaker. ""In theory, we could reject it but that would not hold up legally.""

In Tuesday's session, lawmakers will get a chance to challenge the rushed rescue package and discuss whether conditions can be imposed on Credit Suisse.

Story continues

Last week, Switzerland announced it was cutting bonus payments for Credit Suisse's top management.

""We demand a thorough investigation into how the Credit Suisse crisis could have come about,"" Thierry Burkart, leader of the centre-right FDP party, told Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger.

""The de facto state guarantee of the systematically important banks is a big problem.""

Credit Suisse's rescue angered not only politicians but many in Switzerland. A survey by political research firm gfs.bern found a majority of Swiss did not support the deal.

A poll of Swiss economists found that nearly half think the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS was not the best solution, warning the saga has dented Switzerland's reputation.

Switzerland's KOF economic research institute found that 48% of the 167 university economists it questioned would have preferred a state takeover and possible later sale of Credit Suisse.

There are also growing worries about a staff cull.

In an open letter to the country's parliament, the Swiss Bank Employees' Association said on Tuesday that Credit Suisse and UBS must freeze any job cuts.

https://whtc.com/2023/04/12/swiss-parliament-meets-for-a-second-day-over-credit-suisse-rescue/,Swiss parliament meets for a second day over Credit Suisse rescue,"By Noele Illien

ZURICH (Reuters) – Swiss lawmakers resumed their debate over the rescue of Credit Suisse on Wednesday, after parliament’s two chambers failed to reach an agreement a day earlier.

The vote to approve the 109 billion Swiss francs ($120.82 billion) the government included as part of a rescue package for the Swiss bank is, however, largely symbolic.

The government had already committed the financial guarantees, using emergency law to largely bypass the legislative body in a move that has angered politicians.

While Switzerland’s upper house earlier on Tuesday approved the rescue, its lower, and larger chamber, later rejected it.

Heated debates held in the country’s four national languages continued into early morning hours, with lawmakers fuelling themselves with raclette, hard boiled eggs left over from Easter and wine.

On Wednesday, the will vote again, tweaking the measures in the hope to find agreement.

Speaking in parliament on Wednesday, finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter said lawmakers needed to consider what sort of a financial centre Switzerland wanted to be and what message their rejection of the rescue would send to the world.

“What signal do you want to give internationally, are the institutions reliable, do you value financial market stability in a place where you already have a financial centre with a certain importance?”

Lawmakers were recalled to the country’s capital, Bern, this week for the rare extraordinary session to discuss the rapid rescue of Credit Suisse and the Swiss government’s open chequebook response to a collapse that many in the country have blamed on top management.

A shotgun marriage which saw Credit Suisse taken over by rival UBS for 3 billion Swiss francs and propped up with more than 250 billion Swiss francs in guarantees and support has been the subject of widespread criticism.

In the lead-up to the merger last month, Swiss emergency law was used so that a sub-group of six members of parliament approved the financial commitment on behalf of the legislative body, to the ire of the almost 250 lawmakers left without a say.

“The use of emergency law has reached a level in the last three years that is beginning to annoy me,” Hansjoerg Knecht, a member of Parliament’s upper house, said on Tuesday.

Speaking ahead of the vote on Tuesday, Keller-Sutter acknowledged the frustration.

“I heard anger, I heard frustration, sometimes I also heard a bit of helplessness,” Karin Keller-Sutter said, adding that the merger between historic cross-town rivals Credit Suisse and UBS was not a forced marriage, but one of convenience.

By Scott Murdoch

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Macquarie Group has hired Credit Suisse's top Australian dealmaker Dragi Ristevski, according to a memo from the bank.

Ristevski has been Credit Suisse's head of investment banking and capital markets. He will join Macquarie as the investment bank's head of financial sponsors for Asia Pacific, the memo said.

A Macquarie spokesman confirmed the contents of the memo.

Ristevski joined Credit Suisse in 2021 after spending 11 years at Citigroup where he earned a reputation as one of Australia's top private equity investment bankers.

He hired a number of senior bankers at Credit Suisse in an attempt to compete more aggressively alongside the bulge bracket firms in Australia.

In the memo, Macquarie Capital executive director Tim Joyce said Ristevski had advised high profile clients such as Bain, PEP, KKR, Quadrant and TPG on takeover deals in the region.

UBS last month agreed to buy Zurich rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.31 billion) in a deal engineered by the government, the central bank and market regulator to avoid a meltdown in the country's financial system.

The merged bank could reduce its workforce by 20% to 30%, Swiss media reported on April 2.

On this news, shares of Credit Suisse fell $0.56 per ADS, or 15.64%, to close at $3.02 per ADS on February 9, 2023.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Macquarie Group has hired Credit Suisse's top Australian dealmaker Dragi Ristevski, according to a memo from the bank.

Ristevski has been Credit Suisse's head of investment banking and capital markets. He will join Macquarie as the investment bank's head of financial sponsors for Asia Pacific, the memo said.

A Macquarie spokesman confirmed the contents of the memo.

Ristevski joined Credit Suisse in 2021 after spending 11 years at Citigroup where he earned a reputation as one of Australia's top private equity investment bankers.

He hired a number of senior bankers at Credit Suisse in an attempt to compete more aggressively alongside the bulge bracket firms in Australia.

In the memo, Macquarie Capital executive director Tim Joyce said Ristevski had advised high profile clients such as Bain, PEP, KKR, Quadrant and TPG on takeover deals in the region.

UBS last month agreed to buy Zurich rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.31 billion) in a deal engineered by the government, the central bank and market regulator to avoid a meltdown in the country's financial system.

The merged bank could reduce its workforce by 20% to 30%, Swiss media reported on April 2.
