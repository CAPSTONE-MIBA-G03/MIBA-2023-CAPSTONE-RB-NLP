Outflows from Credit Suisse branded investment funds have accelerated in the weeks since its historic merger with Swiss rival UBS, as investors continue to redeem billions of dollars.

Data provided to Financial News by Morningstar shows net outflows from around 300 EU and US domiciled Credit Suisse funds have reached $5.6 billion over the three weeks since the tie-up.

The latest outflows will pile pressure on the merged firm; investors had already pulled around $3 billion from Credit Suisse funds in the week surrounding the shotgun wedding.

The latest figures show an additional $2.5 billion of net outflows from Credit Suisse funds between March 23 and April 6.

“It is fair to say that there is still uncertainty around the deal and the potential impact that it may have on Credit Suisse Asset Management,” Johann Scholtz, an equity analyst at Morningstar told FN.

Heavy outflows from Credit Suisse funds began on March 14, the day the bank said it had discovered “material weaknesses” in its financial reporting controls.

Credit Suisse declined to comment.

The largest daily outflows remain those recorded on March 21 — two days after the landmark deal was announced — when $776 million was pulled from Credit Suisse’s European funds.

Despite the steady outflows in recent weeks, the Morningstar figures show Credit Suisse’s European funds posted net inflows of more than $240 million over April 5 and April 6 — an early indication that investor jitters are starting to subside.

The flows data does not include all the asset manager’s funds in Europe and the U,S,, and represents only those funds that report daily figures to Morningstar.

Laith Khalaf, head of investments at online platform AJ Bell, said the bulk of fund outflows in the days surrounding the tie-up with UBS was likely driven by investors worried about the stability of Credit Suisse and those spooked by wider banking sector turmoil.

“Those assets should be ring-fenced in the event of an insolvency, but investors might have decided that a belt-and-braces approach was required given the febrile market conditions at the time,” he said.

The $3.25 billion tie-up between UBS and Credit Suisse — the biggest merger between two systematically integral banks since the 2008 global financial crisis — also combined the banks’ respective asset management units, creating Europe’s largest money manager with $1.5 trillion.

UBS announced on March 29 that former boss Sergio Ermotti would return to oversee the merger. Ermotti, who stepped down as UBS chief in 2020 after nine years in the role, took over from Ralph Hamers at the start of April.

Analysts told FN last month that Ermotti would likely face significant challenges bringing together the two management arms, citing differences in corporate cultures, overlapping product ranges and technology issues.

Scholtz said some outflows in recent weeks may have been driven by Credit Suisse’s wealth management clients moving to other firms to “lower their concentration risk” if they are already using similar wealth products and services offered by UBS.

Similarly, some institutional investors with allocation to Credit Suisse funds may want to diversify if they are also UBS Asset Management clients, he said.

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's Board of Governors on Friday said it has approved UBS Group AG's acquisition of the U.S. subsidiaries of Credit Suisse, clearing another major hurdle for the completion of the Swiss-brokered rescue deal.

UBS has committed to give the U.S. central bank an implementation plan for combining its U.S. business and operations with those of Credit Suisse within three months of consummating the deal, the Fed's Board said in a statement. The plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution, the statement said.

The U.S. central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

UBS had requested the Fed's approval of the merger March 22, the Fed said.

After years of scandal and losses, 167-year-old Credit Suisse came to the brink of collapse before Zurich-based rival UBS rode to the rescue with a merger engineered and bankrolled by the Swiss authorities last month. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

The Swiss authorities and UBS Group AG have been racing to close the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG within as little as a month, in an effort to retain the lender's clients and employees, Reuters previously reported.

UBS secured a temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, people familiar with the process told Reuters.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

The Fed subjects firms with more than $700 billion in assets, or more than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activities, to heightened supervision, including annual company-run stress tests and increased liquidity standards.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The government has argued that no matter the outcome of the vote, the state’s 109 billion francs ($122 billion) in guarantees for UBS to takeover Credit Suisse are binding. The government says that’s because a small number of lawmakers — the financial delegation — gave their approval at the time the deal was negotiated in March.

Neue Zuercher Zeitung and Tages-Anzeiger, the main German language newspapers, cited the same emergency law expert who disagrees with the government’s assessment. Both reports also referred to specialists who agreed with the government’s view or acknowledged there was a gray area. One suggested that lawmakers might have voted differently if they thought their ballot actually mattered.

Blick am Sonntag cited a legal expert who said parliament’s views should count, but one needs to take into account what legal obligations the government entered into before parliament said “no.” Those remain in place due to the protection of legitimate expectations and legal certainty.

Meanwhile, the parties that opposed the guarantees — Swiss People’s Party, Greens and Social Democrats — are seeking clarification, Tages-Anzeiger reported.

“What applies must now be clarified,” also in regard to future emergency decisions by the government, said Gregor Rutz, from the SVP, who also spoke of a legal gray area. He is planning to submit an application to the state political commission next week for an investigation, Tages-Anzeiger said.

https://www.investmentnews.com/ubs-in-talks-with-former-executive-naratil-about-possible-return-236372,UBS in talks with former executive Naratil about possible return,"Former UBS Group veteran Tom Naratil has held talks about returning to the bank as part of a broader outreach by Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti, people with knowledge of the matter said.

Ermotti has reached out to a select number of high-profile former UBS bankers to gauge their interest in rejoining, the people said, asking not to be identified as the matter is private. It’s unclear what role may be under discussion for Naratil, who left the bank just six months ago. In almost four decades at the firm he held a number of senior positions, including president of UBS Americas, co-head of wealth management and chief financial officer.

UBS brought back Ermotti, chairman of Swiss Re, as CEO earlier this month to oversee the historic acquisition of Credit Suisse Group after its rival almost collapsed. UBS has already tapped strategy consultant Oliver Wyman for help on the integration, reconnecting Ermotti with former adviser Huw van Steenis, vice chair of the firm, who left the Swiss bank under former CEO Ralph Hamers.

A spokesman for UBS declined to comment. Naratil wasn’t immediately available to comment.

Ermotti may enlist longtime allies with investment banking and finance division experience to help with the massive integration effort of Credit Suisse, a firm that had material weaknesses in its financial reporting and brings a money-losing investment bank. UBS CFO Sarah Youngwood has been in her role for less than a year after being brought in by Hamers, while investment bank chief Rob Karofsky has a trading rather than dealmaking background.

UBS named Karofsky sole head of its investment banking unit in February 2021, elevating its top trader after co-president Piero Novelli accepted a job as chairman of the Euronext stock exchange. He joined UBS in 2014, helping drive a digital transformation of the markets unit, an area Hamers had wanted to focus on.

Naratil stepped down as the joint leader of the key wealth unit and president of UBS’s business in the Americas late last year. As well as previously serving as CFO during Ermotti’s first term, he was also chief risk officer for wealth management in the Americas.

UBS elevated Iqbal Khan as sole head of the global wealth management business and appointed Naureen Hassan to succeed Naratil as president of UBS Americas and chief executive officer of UBS Americas Holding.

Last month, UBS agreed to acquire its local rival in an emergency, government-backed rescue after Credit Suisse lost the confidence of investors, clients and other banks following a string of scandals, losses and client outflows. The combination of the two major banks has the potential to create a wealth management powerhouse with some $5 trillion in invested assets.

A strong finance function is a priority for Ermotti to ensure confidence after Credit Suisse’s troubles included problems with its annual report, and because of the challenges ahead, including winding down problem assets and potentially spinning off its Swiss domestic business, according to one of the people.

Khan, who helped run Credit Suisse’s wealth business for several years before jumping to UBS in 2019, has already been on the road courting his former colleagues to stick around as his bank aims to halt a talent exodus before the deal closes, Bloomberg News reported.",[],2023-04-14 14:51:24+00:00

(AP ... [+] Photo/Paul Sakuma) Copyright 2009 AP. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Analysts at investment bank UBS are forecasting that some 50,000 U.S. stores are likely to close by the end of 2027, because of expected cutbacks in consumer spending, tighter credit and the continued shift to ecommerce.

Store closings could accelerate to 70,000 to 90,000 if retail sales turn out to be weaker than expected, according to UBS.

The United States gained stores in 2021, adding a net total of about 11,000 new stores. Last year, the country returned to the previous pattern of shrinking store counts, with 1,500 store closing as of the third quarter of 2022, according to UBS.

The pace of store closings has already accelerated this year, UBS said, with small chains and mom-and-pop stores being most at risk in the current economy. As of 2020, more than half of retail stores were operated by companies with fewer than 20 employees, and 68% of stores were operated by chains with less than 500 employees

The store-closing forecast is based on the assumption by UBS analysts that ecommerce penetration will increase from 20% currently to 26% by 2027. UBS calculates that every 100 basis point increase in online percentage of sales triggers about 8,000 store closings.

Banks are showing they are less willing to make consumer installment loans, which will hurt consumers’ ability to spend. UBS also expects there to will less capital available to allow entrepreneurs to open new retail stores.

Higher costs, particularly labor costs, also will drive store closings, UBS said. “Notably, despite all the automation in retail over the past several years, employees per store has increased for several retail sub-sectors,” according to UBS.

Home improvements stores had an average of 21 employees per store in 2021, compared to 16 in 2012. Electronics, home furnishings, auto parts, grocery, and sporting goods stores also have reported increases in average numbers of employees per store.

The retail sectors expected to have the most store closings, according to UBS, are clothing and clothing accessories (approximately 14,000); consumer electronics (some 9,000 closings); and home furnishings (4,000 closings).

Smaller number of closings are forecast for the home improvement and general merchandise sectors, and the number of auto parts stores is expected remain steady.

In-store fulfillment of online grocery orders is expected to help keep physical grocery stores open.

Since 2018. clothing stores have had the most store closings (down 10,500), followed by consumer electronics stores (-3,000) and sporting goods (-1,300).

Over the next five years, shopping center growth is expected to be limited, and thus will not contribute to store growth.

While the number of shopping centers continued to grow modestly in 2022, UBS believes the number of U.S. shopping centers, and the amount of shopping center square footage, have peaked, meaning mall-based stores face the greatest risk of closings.

The shift in malls toward more food and non-retail tenants will also contribute to store closings, UBS said.

“Even for malls that remain open, we believe there will be a shift away from retail to non-retail establishments, leading to retail closures,” the report said.","['Joan Verdon', 'Amy Danise', 'Senior Contributor']",2023-04-12 00:00:00

Shares of General Electric Co. gained ground Thursday after bullish UBS analyst Chris Snyder raised his price target by 15%, saying the aviation, power and renewable-energy company is a defensive play in the face of a worrisome economic outlook.

Synder said while the market’s valuation of GE’s stock may be “pushing near the upper limit,” his chief concern is geopolitical, not macroeconomic.

“[GE’s] exposure is defensive and well positioned for the macro at hand with each business line seeing low-risk [positive] rate of change, into both 2023 [and] 2024,” Snyder wrote in a note to clients.

He reiterated the buy rating he’s had on GE’s stock for at least three years while lifting his price target to $109 from $95. The stock hasn’t closed at or above $109 since January 2018.

The stock rose 0.2% to close at $94.30, with Snyder’s new price target implying further 15.6% upside. It has slipped 2.7% since closing at a five-year high of $96.92 on April 3.

Synder said his new price target includes a $94-per-share valuation for GE’s aviation business and a $16-per-share valuation for GE Vernova, which includes the company’s power and renewable-energy businesses.

GE Vernova is expected to separate from GE in early 2024, which would leave GE operating as GE Aerospace. GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. separated from GE in January 2023.

GE is scheduled to report first-quarter results on April 25 before the opening bell. Since the end of January, after the separation of GE HealthCare, the average analyst estimate compiled by FactSet for earnings per share has increased to 14 cents from 13 cents, while the FactSet revenue consensus has slipped to $13.25 billion from $13.35 billion.

Of the 21 analysts surveyed by FactSet who cover GE, 14 are bullish and seven are neutral, and the average stock-price target is $101.17. Snyder’s new price target makes him the fourth most bullish on the stock.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Wednesday drew an upgrade to buy from hold at UBS on the stock’s attractive valuation and lower risk profile than its peers.

UBS also upgraded boutique investment bank Evercore Inc. by two notches to buy from sell and adjusted price targets for Morgan Stanley as well as wealth-management specialists Charles Schwab Corp. Ameriprise Financial Inc. LPL Financial Holdings Inc. Stifel Financial Corp. and Regions Financial Corp.

Analyst Brennan Hawken said Goldman Sachs “appears well positioned to outperform amidst elevated levels of market volatility” with potential growth in its asset- and wealth-management business and transactional banking.

Goldman Sachs offers less exposure to consumer deposits and commercial banking than other firms, analysts said.

The investment bank also enjoys an opportunity to accelerate its asset-management business through “attractively priced mergers and acquisitions,” Hawken said.

UBS hiked Goldman’s price target to $385 a share from $350 a share.

Shares of Goldman Sachs rose 0.8%.

Evercore stock rose 1.5% after UBS rated the bank a buy and lifted its price target to $135 a share from $112.

Hawken said Evercore “is executing better than expected” in the downtrodden business of mergers and acquisition advisory services.

While M&A completion volumes were down 50% in the first quarter, UBS is forecasting a less severe 20% drop in its M&A advisory business.

The figure indicates that Evercore’s investment-banking relationships “are strong enough to generate over $500 million per quarter even though financing banks are in a better competitive position,” Hawken said.

In terms of price-target adjustments, Evercore and Goldman were the only two out of 11 financial stocks covered by UBS to get increases instead of price cuts on Wednesday.

UBS reduced its price target for Morgan Stanley to $98 a share from $108 and reiterated a buy rating.

UBS also reiterated buy ratings on Schwab and Ameriprise and cut their price targets to $70 from $90 for the former and to $285 from $400 for the latter.

UBS reiterated a neutral rating on LPL Financial and cut its price target on the stock to $215 from $235.

Analysts also reiterated a neutral rating on Stifel Financial and cut their price target by $6 to $62. A neutral rating was reiterated for Regions Financial, while its price target was reduced to $100 from $130.

UBS reiterated a buy rating on Houlihan Lokey Inc. and cut its price target to $105 from $115. It kept its neutral rating on Lazard Ltd. and reduced its price target to $32 from $40. It also reiterated a sell rating on Moelis & Co. and reduced its price target to $27 from $30.

https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/ubs-can-score-quick-win-with-swiss-sale-2023-04-12/,UBS can score a quick win with Swiss sale,"













LONDON, April 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Credit Suisse’s (CSGN.S) Swiss business is theoretically the jewel in the bank’s tarnished crown. But for UBS (UBSG.S) Chair Colm Kelleher, getting rid of his rival’s local unit may nonetheless be the least-bad option.

A key appeal of UBS’s state-backed emergency rescue of its struggling peer is the chance to axe expenses. Meshing Credit Suisse’s local bank – which serves retail, corporate and wealthy clients in Switzerland – with UBS’s equivalent division could generate $1.5 billion of annual savings, according to RBC analysts. Those could have a net present value of $9.5 billion, after factoring in tax and restructuring costs, according to a Breakingviews calculation.

Yet the savings could easily disappoint. Swiss clients of both UBS and Credit Suisse may decide to spread their risk by moving some business elsewhere, rather than sticking entirely with the newly created behemoth. RBC analysts reckon these so-called dis-synergies could lead to a $1.4 billion loss of revenue in Switzerland, or roughly one-third of the Credit Suisse unit’s 2022 top line.

UBS also risks inflaming opposition to the deal, which will create a giant with 29% of total Swiss deposits and may lead to job losses and branch closures in the country. Politicians, who debated the takeover in an emergency session on Tuesday, can’t block it. But after the 2008 crisis, many governments punished banks by imposing taxes and pay restrictions. Swiss solvency rules already include add-ons linked to market share, meaning UBS may in future have to fund the combined domestic business with more capital than if the two divisions were separate.

Hiving off the Credit Suisse local unit could save Kelleher and his Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti a lot of grief. It may also generate a handsome payday, which could help speed up the rest of the merger integration. The legal entity that houses much of Credit Suisse’s domestic business last year made about a 9% return on $14 billion of shareholder’s equity, according to Breakingviews calculations. That justifies a valuation of perhaps $11 billion, assuming a conservative 12% cost of equity. By contrast, UBS is paying just $3.6 billion for all of Credit Suisse, based on the buyer’s most recent share price.

The tricky part would be how to structure a deal. Kelleher could in theory just hand the Credit Suisse local division to shareholders, but that could prove destabilising if they all cash out immediately. Another option is to raise funds by listing a chunk of the shares, and sell the rest over time. It helps that most of Credit Suisse’s domestic business is already in a carved-out unit with its own capital and funding requirements.

True, a sale or listing would add one more complication to an already tricky deal. But it has to be simpler than a lengthy and politically fraught integration.

CONTEXT NEWS

Switzerland’s parliament on April 11 failed to approve the 109 billion Swiss francs ($120.5 billion) of financial guarantees used to rescue Credit Suisse in a deal with UBS last month, in a first-round vote that was largely symbolic.

The lower house retrospectively rejected the rescue at close to midnight, with heated debates continuing into the early hours of April 12. Earlier on April 11, Switzerland’s upper house had approved the rescue, meaning the two chambers of the legislative body will vote again.

The votes are, however, largely symbolic because the state committed the funds and lawmakers cannot overturn that decision.

UBS will rescue Credit Suisse in a deal worth about 3 billion Swiss francs, Swiss authorities and the two banks said on March 19.

UBS Group AG agreed to buy Credit Suisse Group AG in a historic, government-brokered deal aimed at containing a crisis of confidence that threatened to spread across global financial markets.

(Bloomberg) -- Swiss parliament’s lower house on Tuesday evening began debating whether to approve 109 billion francs ($120 billion) in government guarantees for UBS Group AG’s takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG. The upper house gave its green light earlier in the day.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Lawmakers from both sides of the political spectrum again lined up to blame the government, regulators and the bank’s management for failures around the takeover last month. Two hours into the debate in the lower house, it wasn’t clear if a vote on the guarantees would be held Tuesday night.

Damien Cottier, an MP with the Liberal-Radicals, called the day the deal was struck a “day of shame” for Switzerland before going on to call it the “least-bad and least risky” option.

Cottier’s tone reflects that of many frustrated lawmakers who are critical — and in an election year want to be seen as being so — of the banks and the government while at the same time are wary of trying to block the deal. Though parliament doesn’t have the power to derail the takeover, the extraordinary session has forced the government to once again defend the unpopular emergency takeover by UBS Group AG announced on March 19.

In that vein, Swiss President Alain Berset opened the lower-house debate after 7pm local time by saying Credit Suisse’s “negative spiral” spurred his government into action. Temporary nationalisation, a forced bankruptcy and orderly wind-down of the bank were all considered but rejected in favor of the UBS takeover, he said.

The government, Swiss National Bank and Swiss banking regulator Finma “acted in a decisive manner to restore confidence,” Berset said.

Earlier in the day, more than a dozen lawmakers in the upper house voiced their grievances. Their concerns varied from being circumvented in the emergency legislation, to regulatory lapses that allowed Credit Suisse’s failings to go un-addressed, to demanding accountability for the bank’s management.

“The legal possibilities against the bankers responsible and the possibilities to claw back bonuses need to be exhausted to the fullest extent,” said the president of the Free Democrats Thierry Burkart.

Some legislators called for greater powers for the financial regulator, Finma, amid a broader review of too-big-to-fail rules for the sector, while others asked for a parliamentary inquiry commission. Quick legislative changes are unlikely though, as became apparent during the debate.

The deal — described by Berset earlier as the best option to re-establish confidence in markets — created a banking giant whose assets are more than twice the size of the Swiss economy.

Job Cuts

Politicians and business leaders have voiced worries that the combined lender will have excessive market power, leading to a loss of competition. Despite the risks involved in integrating Credit Suisse, UBS stands to become a banking “powerhouse” post merger, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in a note Tuesday.

UBS, already one of the world’s largest wealth managers, is now taking over a key rival for a fraction of the value of its assets and receiving as much as 9 billion Swiss francs in government loss guarantees.

Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter made clear that if these guarantees turned out to be not enough, it would be up to parliament to decide on an extension. The government and UBS agreed on the lender taking on the first 5 billion francs in potential losses, before the administration steps in for the next 9 billion.

Before the takeover, Credit Suisse had already planned to cut as many as 9,000 jobs worldwide over the coming years. The overlaps between the two banks’ businesses will likely lead to that number rising, though executives including UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher have said that it’s too early to say how big the cuts will be.

‘Finma Failed’

Finma didn’t move in time, said Heidi Z’graggen, upper-house member of the Center Alliance.

“Finma’s job is to protect shareholder rights and ensure functioning of the financial center,” she said. “At this, Finma failed.”

A parliamentary inquiry commission is necessary to answer whether the financial regulator, the Swiss National Bank and the finance ministry reacted properly, she said. Such a body would have subpoena powers to summon witnesses.

Given the merger has been met with little public enthusiasm, parliament is also trying to curtail government powers in the future: They are attempting to block the use of emergency measures to push through deals like this.

Stock prices aren't going to make much sense the rest of this year with investors grappling with waves of confusing economic data, according to UBS. Richard Drew/Associated Press

Stock prices for the rest of 2023, UBS's investment chief predicts.

Markets could ""keep jumping from one narrative to another"" as economic data rolls in, Mark Haefele said.

Investors are still struggling to make sense of the US labor market, he added.

It's going to remain tricky for investors to pick stocks for the rest of this year because markets are still hooked on unpredictable economic data, according to UBS.

The Swiss bank's CIO Mark Haefele expects the choppiness stocks seen in the early months of 2023 to continue, thanks to traders' fixation on the rate of inflation and unemployment.

""So far, 2023 has been a much better year for asset class returns, with the S&P 500 up 7.5% year-to-date, but has been characterized by ever-changing market narratives,"" Haefele wrote in a note Wednesday.

The investment chief was referring to the benchmark US stock index's rebound this year from a plunge of 18% in 2022.

""The potential remains for this data-dependent market to keep jumping from one narrative to another for the rest of the year,"" he added. ""This should make it difficult for investors to navigate the coming months.""

The note comes ahead of the release later Wednesday of the monthly Consumer Price Index report, which will show how much US inflation rose in March. His bank believes the CPI will come in at 5.1% — down from 6% in February, but still far off the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

Markets will stay unpredictable even if inflation cools for a ninth month in a row, according to Haefele, because investors are still struggling to make sense of the US labor market.

Friday's nonfarm payrolls report showed the US economy added 236,000 jobs in March, its lowest print since December 2020. Investors are divided on whether that's good or bad news.

""While the optimistic interpretation of this data is that the tightness in the labor market is easing as the balance of supply and demand of labor improves, the pessimists view it as the first cracks that could be followed by much greater deterioration in the coming months,"" Haefele said.

Worries about an economic slowdown could soon replace inflation tracking as a key focus, UBS's investment chief added.

Economists have warned that the Fed's year of aggressive interest-rate hikes will likely soon start weighing on growth – and that slowdown could drag on stocks by chipping away at listed companies' earnings.

""As inflation eases, growth may take over as the more dominant concern, perceived or otherwise,"" Haefele said.

""The optics of a decline in headline CPI to 3% may reinforce the view that growth, rather than inflation, will be driving Fed decisions and the market's performance,"" he added.

The vote was mostly symbolic as a parliamentary commission had already approved the rescue plan, which mostly involved guarantees through the Swiss central bank, not parliament,

In addition, the upper house of the Swiss parliament had voted earlier to accept the transaction that was announced on March 19 by Switzerland's seven-member executive branch — known as the Federal Council land headed by the Swiss president — along with the Swiss National Bank and Finma, the Swiss financial markets regulator.

Debate on Wednesday was expected to focus on working out the differences between the two chambers, the AP said.

https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/50-000-stores-could-close-193032161.html,"50,000 Stores Could Close in the Next 5 Years, UBS Says","Store closures are expected to pick up again in 2023 and could total more than 50,000 in the next five years.

That’s according to a recent report from UBS, which found that store closures in 2023 are already up significantly compared to the prior year. In the last few months, various retailers have announced plans to consolidate their store bases and close stores. Foot Locker last month announced a decision to close more than 400 stores locations through 2026 focus on higher-performing doors. Walmart also recently announced a plan to close seven underperforming stores, including its last two pickup and delivery concept locations.

More from Footwear News

By the end of 2027, UBS estimates that about 50,000 stores will close across the current U.S. store count of about 940,000 stores, meaning there would be less than 5 percent fewer stores by the end of 2027.

Retailers have announced about 2,600 store closures and 5,100 store openings for the year, according to Coresight Research cited in BDO’s bi-annual bankruptcy report. Store openings this year have been mainly led by dollar store and discount chains, which have benefitted from cost-cutting consumers.

As for the reasons for the predicted closures, UBS outlined a few key factors. For starters, the cost to run a store is going up, especially as wages increase and rents stay high. At the same time, a general slowdown in consumer spending, less available credit and e-commerce growth are also to blame.

UBS predicts e-commerce penetration to grow from its current 20 percent to 26 percent by 2027, with 25 percent of online sales being fulfilled from stores. This model also assumes that retail sales grow 4 percent annually.

Story continues

The National Retail Federation forecast that retail sales will grow between 4 percent and 6 percent in 2023, with sales reaching between $5.13 trillion and $5.23 trillion this year. While NRF has said a recession is unlikely in 2023, a recession could result in even more store closures, UBS said.

The stores at risk of closures are those of smaller chains, department stores and specialty retailers with mainly discretionary items.

“In our view, these smaller chains and mom and pops are most at risk of closures given these firms typically have less access to capital needed to invest in developing a robust omnichannel offering,” UBS analysts wrote in the report.

Meanwhile, off-price retailers and dollar stores are set to continue to grow their presence as they resonate with cost-conscious consumers.

Like store closures, retail bankruptcies are set to come back into play in a big way in 2023 after a relatively slow year in 2022. Between the start of 2023 through the end of February, six major retailers filed for bankruptcy, according to BDO’s bi-annual bankruptcy report. That’s more than the total number of retail bankruptcies in 2022.

In some cases, these bankruptcies could correlate with store closures for chains as well.

UBS-Credit Suisse merger: The US Federal Reserve on Friday approved UBS Group AG taking over US subsidiaries of Credit Suisse Group. The US Fed said that the UBS Group had sought its approval to the deal on March 22.

As part of the deal, UBS will provide the Fed with “an implementation plan” for combining the US businesses of the two firms. The plan will be updated quarterly and will include UBS’ obligations to comply with more stringent “enhanced prudential standards”, the Fed said on Friday.

In a statement, the US Fed said the plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution. As per rules, the US central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

Last month, after the sudden collapse of US-based Silicon Valley Bank, investors lost confidence in Credit Suisse, which is Switzerland’s largest bank. In a matter of few days, Swiss authorities announced that UBS would buy Credit Suisse to contain further banking turmoil after the global lender had come to the brink of collapse. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets. Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

Besides the US, UBS secured temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, according to a report in Reuters.

Earlier this month, UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said that the unexpected takeover of rival Credit Suisse a significant milestone for Switzerland and for the global financial industry, which carries a “huge amount of risk”.

Addressing the annual shareholder meeting on April 5, Kelleher said that the takeover will take at least three to four years to take shape, excluding Credit Suisse’s non-core investment bank portfolio, which will have more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Describing the transaction as ""the first merger of two globally systematically important banks,"" Kelleher said the takeover ""means a new beginning and huge opportunities ahead for the combined bank and for the Swiss financial center as a whole.""

“Having a clear vision and a sound strategy is important….This transaction is the first merger of two global systemically important banks. This is not in any way an easy deal to do and brings with it execution risk,” Kelleher said.

A day before, Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann, while addressing the last AGM of the flagship bank, apologised to the shareholders for failing to contain the crisis, which led to its closure. In an emotional speech at Credit Suisse's last annual general meeting, chairman Axel Lehmann spoke of being caught off guard, pain, bitterness, accumulated scandals, and the grief that remains.

However, he said it would be business as usual in the short term.

Sources told TOI that Cognizant, TCS and Wipro have deals with Credit Suisse, amounting collectively to as much as $350-400 million annually. The remaining slice of the outsourcing pie is shared between Infosys, Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech.

""It's good to assume there will be change. The way the regulators structured the deal (UBS taking over Credit Suisse) has brought in stability. All the existing work that's being done in countries, in technology and operations, all of that is continuing as business as usual. In two quarters, we will pitch to them (UBS) how they can leverage synergies,"" he said. He expects more business from the integration.

In the March quarter, TCS signed $10 billion in total contract value, out of which $3 billion came from banking & financial services. Revenue grew a modest 0.6% in constant currency compared to the preceding quarter, weighed by banking and financial services. ""After the SVB (Silicon Valley Bank) collapse, customers became a bit tentative. They want to do projects, but they want to spend wisely. If they don't do anything in six months, given the pace at which technology changes, they will become a legacy company very quickly. They have deferred a few projects which have impacted our revenue,"" he said.

Subramaniam said banks are focusing on cost-optimisation by simplifying the organisation. ""The whole approach is to kill reconciliation. In each bank, there are thousands of people doing reconciliation work in the back office. They don't need them if they optimise using tech. With newer technologies like generative AI, there are opportunities to co-innovate and cocreate,"" he added.

Subramaniam said he doesn't anticipate the chain reaction that was pronounced in the banking and financial services space during the great financial crisis of 2008.

Have you ever thought about investing in a Swiss bank? It’s actually not a bad idea, especially if we’re talking about UBS Group (NYSE:UBS). First of all, UBS stock is trading at a reasonable valuation. Plus, UBS Group’s takeover of Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) shouldn’t be as troublesome as some fearmongers would have you believe.

Banking-sector contagion isn’t limited to any single nation or continent. UBS Group’s “shotgun wedding” merger with Credit Suisse demonstrated that a crisis could strike practically anywhere, anytime.

Some people are unhappy with UBS Group’s takeover of Credit Suisse, perhaps because it will create a financial sector giant. Even if they’re not pleased with the outcome, however, the acquisition is still likely to take place. So, why not wager on a power player that happens to be trading at a fair price right now?

What’s Happening With UBS Stock?

CS stock was hammered after UBS Group announced its planned buyout of Credit Suisse for $3.2 billion. Reportedly, the deal will create a bank with “assets double the size of” Switzerland’s “annual economic output.”

Meanwhile, UBS stock has dup relatively well, considering there’s a multinational banking crisis in progress. If you choose to purchase some shares now, you’ll have access to UBS Group forward annual dividend yield of 1.32%.

Additionally, you’ll get a decent value with UBS stock. As it turns out, UBS Group’s GAAP trailing-12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9.2x is below the sector median of 9.44x. Also, the company’s trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash-flow (P/CF) ratios are all lower than the respective sector medians.

And by the way, UBS Group has beaten Wall Street’s EPS forecasts during the past four quarters. So far, the company looks like a winner for growth, value and dividend investors.

Don’t Worry About UBS Group’s Merger With Credit Suisse

I’ve already mentioned that UBS Group’s merger with Credit Suisse will create a financial giant. Will the deal actually go through despite some people’s opposition, though?

Bank of America analyst Alastair Ryan doesn’t seem to be losing sleep about it. He recently upgraded UBS stock from “neutral” to “buy,” lifting his price target on the shares from $22.65 to $24.81. The analyst’s commentary about the merger was definitely upbeat:

“We think the objective of this transaction, while solving CS’ situation & associated risks for the system, is to reach a win/win, where UBS shareholders also get value out of this deal over time.”

Ryan’s optimism seems to be justified. Reportedly, the Bank of England has approved UBS Group’s takeover of Credit Suisse in the United Kingdom. Moreover, European Union antitrust regulators gave UBS Group a temporary green light (pending a review) to complete the Credit Suisse acquisition.

On top of all that, Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter declared that she doesn’t “see any stumbling blocks at the moment” concerning the merger between UBS Group and Credit Suisse.

What You Can Do Now

Even if some people are opposed to UBS Group forming a banking leviathan with Credit Suisse, let’s be honest here. The merger will probably go through whether the critics want it to or not.

So, as an investor, there’s really no need to worry about that. In addition, UBS Group has a strong quarterly earnings track record. It’s also worth noting that UBS Group offers an enticing combination of value and yield. All in all, the bull case for UBS stock is super strong and you should think about buying some shares today.

Stefan Wermuth/Bloomberg

The Federal Reserve Board of Governors approved UBS's acquisition of Credit Suisse's U.S. business on Friday afternoon.

The acquisition of Credit Suisse's New York-based holding company is part of UBS's $3.25 billion acquisition of its distressed domestic rival. The combination of the two banks was brokered by the Swiss government and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority last month to preempt Credit Suisse's collapse.

UBS's acquisition of Credit Suisse came at a tumultuous time in the global banking industry following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Credit Suisse had a long, well-documented history of regulatory problems and appeared to be in danger of collapse before the deal was struck.

The Swiss National Bank supported the acquisition by providing liquidity to UBS on March 19. To help facilitate the transaction and provide support to other central banks around the world, the Fed enhanced its dollar liquidity swap facility that same day.

UBS's acquisition of Credit Suisse will result in ""more stringent enhanced prudential standards, including liquidity standards,"" the Fed said in a press release issued Friday.

UBS's U.S. subsidiary, UBS Americas Holding, has nearly $202 billion of assets under management, according to the U.S. Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, making it the 22nd largest bank holding company in the country.

As part of its approval, the Fed will allow UBS to keep the assets from Credit Suisse Holdings USA in a separate holding company for one year, after which they will have to be consolidated. Those Credit Suisse assets total more than $57 billion, according to the FFIEC.

Credit Suisse's Americas business includes investment banking, private banking, corporate debt underwriting and asset management.

Following the consolidation under a single holding company, UBS's U.S. operation will be upgraded from Category III to Category II under the Fed's regulatory tailoring rules. Such a change would bring with it requirements for annual company-run stress testing and ""advanced approaches"" to risk-based capital requirements.

Upon completion of the deal, UBS will have three months to provide the Fed with a plan for how it will adapt to the new regulatory and supervisory standards that come with the change in categorization.

UBS's implementation plan must also outline the structural organization of its consolidated U.S. operations, including whether branches will be consolidated or closed.

UBS will then have to provide quarterly updates to the Fed's Board of Governors in Washington as well as to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on its progress in implementing the plan.

Until the assets are combined, UBS will have to treat the two holding companies as distinct entities and will be responsible for ensuring that both meet all the regulatory requirements, the Fed noted.","['Stefan Wermuth Bloomberg', 'Staff Writer', 'American Banker']",2023-04-14 21:04:45.921000

Analyst Price Forecast Suggests 6.05% Upside

As of April 6, 2023, the average one-year price target for Ingredion is $112.61. The forecasts range from a low of $106.05 to a high of $126.00. The average price target represents an increase of 6.05% from its latest reported closing price of $106.18.

The projected annual revenue for Ingredion is $8,615MM, an increase of 8.42%. The projected annual non-GAAP EPS is $8.10.

Ingredion Declares $0.71 Dividend

On March 15, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.71 per share ($2.84 annualized). Shareholders of record as of April 3, 2023 will receive the payment on April 25, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.71 per share.

At the current share price of $106.18 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 2.67%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 2.87%, the lowest has been 1.84%, and the highest has been 3.95%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.33 (n=236).

The current dividend yield is 0.58 standard deviations below the historical average.

Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.38. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.

The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.13%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time.

On the one hand, the bank believes that ""unsynchronized"" global growth and recessionary concerns in the U.S. make it difficult for mining companies to perform well. On the other hand, UBS expects energy stocks to continue delivering bumper cash flow this year, according to UBS. ""Both sectors tend to benefit from rising global growth, but we don't expect that. That is why we think this is an appealing relative opportunity,"" UBS strategists led by Gerry Fowler wrote in a note to clients on April 3. ""Energy free cashflow is very high and we think sustainable. Mining free cashflow is set to deteriorate significantly, in our view."" The performance of both sectors has been weak so far this year, with the Stoxx Europe Basic Resources index down by 6.7% and the Stoxx Europe Energy index up by just 1.8%. However, UBS thinks investors have an opportunity to target the relative value between those two sectors as their paths diverge during this period of global growth. The following table shows eight buy-rated energy stocks with double-digit price targets. The table below shows six sell-rated mining stocks with significant downside to their price targets. UBS analysts have forecast that free cash flow from the mining sector will decline as bulk commodity prices retrace from their highs. Copper prices are still hovering around their highs for this decade at about $4 a pound. If commodity prices move lower toward their forecasts, UBS estimates that free cash flow from the sector will fall to little more than 5%. On the flip side, UBS said it believes that even if Brent crude oil trades at $85 per barrel in 2024, current market levels would still provide a free cash flow yield of around 15% for energy stocks. That's likely to happen for two reasons. First, valuations on energy companies are currently priced at a discount rate compared with pre-Covid levels, according to UBS, making them cheaper than before. Second, the bank's analysts said the U.S. economy is predicted not to grow significantly, causing demand to exceed supply again within the coming months and leading to potentially sharp falls in commodity prices.",['Ganesh Rao'],2023-04-10 00:00:00

By Hannah Lang, Chris Prentice and Ann Saphir

April 14 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's Board of Governors on Friday said it has approved UBS Group AG's acquisition of the U.S. subsidiaries of Credit Suisse, clearing another major hurdle for the completion of the Swiss-brokered rescue deal.

UBS has committed to give the U.S. central bank an implementation plan for combining its U.S. business and operations with those of Credit Suisse within three months of consummating the deal, the Fed's Board said in a statement. The plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution, the statement said.

The U.S. central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

After years of scandal and losses, 167-year-old Credit Suisse came to the brink of collapse before Zurich-based rival UBS rode to the rescue with a merger engineered and bankrolled by the Swiss authorities last month. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

The Swiss authorities and UBS Group AG have been racing to close the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG within as little as a month, in an effort to retain the lender's clients and employees, Reuters previously reported.

UBS secured a temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, people familiar with the process told Reuters.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

The Fed subjects firms with more than $700 billion in assets, or more than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activities, to heightened supervision, including annual company-run stress tests and increased liquidity standards.

The Swiss parliament is due to hold an extraordinary session next week to discuss the emergency merger engineered by the Swiss authorities after Credit Suisse came close to collapse.

Nearly 260 billion Swiss francs ($287 billion) of liquidity support and state guarantees have been offered to back the takeover and avoid a financial meltdown the bank's uncontrolled failure could have triggered.

""There is a merger agreement between UBS and CS, for its part the cabinet has made a commitment to the national bank to provide CS with liquidity in order to ensure stability,"" Keller-Sutter told newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft.

""The guarantee agreement with UBS is still being negotiated. In many committee meetings, I got the impression that politicians definitely don't want to jeopardize the takeover,"" she added.

""I don't see any stumbling blocks at the moment.""

Completing the merger was the highest priority, the minister said, who defended the government's intervention last month, which critics have said came too late and promised too much taxpayer support for a bank that paid out billions in bonuses to executives.

""The primary goal of the Federal Council was to ensure the stability of the Swiss economy and the Swiss financial center and to prevent an international financial crisis,"" she said.

""Under the circumstances, it was and is the best possible choice, which also places the least burden on the state and the taxpayer,"" Keller-Sutter said.

The new combined bank will have $1.6 trillion in assets - double the size of the entire Swiss economy - and more than 120,000 staff and Keller-Sutter said the structure of UBS would have to be considered in the future.

""UBS will have to hold more equity after the takeover. This will rather force them to shrink,"" Keller-Sutter said.

Switzerland's Competition Commission can also make recommendations, the minister added.

The risks to the taxpayer were also acceptable - even though the government could assume up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS by the takeover.

Keller-Sutter criticized the culture at Credit Suisse, which she said had set the wrong incentives and had not learned from previous scandals and prosecutions.

The minister also defended the writedown of AT1 bonds to zero, a controversial part of the rescue.

""These are high-risk bonds with high yields, sometimes over 9%,"" Keller-Sutter said. ""The prospectus for these bonds makes it clear that if a company claims indirect government aid, they can be written off.""

The special parliamentary session next week was important, she added, and a welcome opportunity to get to the truth of the Credit Suisse debacle.

""At the moment, parliament can 'only' advise on the commitment credit, but it also has the opportunity to comment on the case and play an active role in the process."" ($1 = 0.9051 Swiss francs) (Reporting by John Revill Editing by Tomasz Janowski)",[],

The move would give the Swiss lender a stronger foothold among the growing ranks of Indian billionaires while underscoring a return for Khan, who steered the private wealth business during his time at Credit Suisse before joining UBS in 2019. Credit Suisse has around 40 wealth management employees in India and around 7,000 people.

UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment on the report to Bloomberg. By 2014, UBS had opted to exit India's private-wealth market. In recent months, UBS has already hired several Credit Suisse private bankers in Singapore to target India's wealthy client portfolio, including Gautam Anand, a managing director.

https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2023/04/10/Facilities/ubs-arena-islanders-naming-rights-mercedes-f1-team-sponsorship.aspx,"UBS says Isles deal ‘has delivered,’ F1 ‘important’ for brand","The Islanders this week will wrap up UBS Arena’s second regular season, and the building’s naming rights sponsor feels the venue “has certainly delivered” thus far. “It’s won several design awards, and that’s been very important for us when it comes to our client base,” notes Anneliese Mesilati, UBS’ head of brand activation, sponsorships and events, Americas. “We’re a global wealth manager, so for us to be able to bring our clients through the door and see this luxury, elevated experience is extremely important. … Around 97% of the club spaces have been sold, so that’s important for us.” UBS, a Switzerland-based financial services and wealth advisory firm, has not been a notable spender in U.S. sports sponsorships until recently. The company, which now has around one-third of its employees based in the U.S., inked its most high-profile stateside deal by putting the UBS name on the Isles’ arena as part of a 20-year pact. “It was an opportunity for us to demonstrate and accelerate our commitment and presence in the U.S.,” said Mesilati. “We viewed that this would be a highly visible destination for visitors across the globe, but also from the New York area, which is extremely important for our ultra-high net worth clients.” Mesilati also noted the timing of the deal, signed in July 2020, meant UBS was taking something of a chance on the bounceback of the live fan experience. “It was very counterintuitive to enter into a naming rights agreement in the middle of a global pandemic,” she said. “But we always had absolute confidence.”

STRONG AS OAK: One key area of collaboration between UBS and the Islanders at the local level has come in the form of the 43 Oak Foundation, a DEI-driven youth hockey program that UBS and the Islanders have pledged $1M toward over a five-year period. The effort, which has seen involvement from both Islanders and UBS execs, focuses on bringing down barriers to playing hockey for underprivileged and minority athletes, serving primarily N.Y. metro area players ages 12-22 by providing transportation, equipment, ice time, funding for travel and other resources -- not to mention mentorship from both Islanders and UBS senior execs. “We work very closely with the players on career development, interview skills,” Mesilati noted when talking about off-ice efforts within the program. “We can have generational impact there.” Participation in the initiative has grown 500% since its start, and has even expanded beyond the N.Y. metro area.

WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Another key sports sponsorship pact for UBS is with the Mercedes F1 team, which counts Lewis Hamilton and George Russell as drivers. Mesilati said the growth of F1 in the U.S. has “extremely important” to UBS -- something she attributed to the popularity of “Drive to Survive” on Netflix. “Miami is a core market for UBS,” Mesilati noted when discussing the race that debuted on the grounds of Hard Rock Stadium last year. “We have a huge percentage of our business in the Miami area. We were extremely over-subscribed. Huge amount of demand from our clients. … We cannot wait for Vegas. … It will be a huge platform for us.” UBS around two years ago also began sponsoring shows on streaming service PlayersTV to promote its wealth management services. That included “Front Office,” a Chris Paul-backed show focused on athlete entrepreneurs such as Michelle Wie, Mookie Betts and Travis Kelce. Two other shows -- “Long Game” and “Level Up” -- are hosted by former NFLer and current UBS exec Wale Ogunleye. “It really worked for us because it enabled a way for us to authentically engage with athletes,” said Mesilati.",[],2023-04-10 00:00:00

Huntington Bancshares Declares $0.16 Dividend

On January 20, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share ($0.62 annualized). Shareholders of record as of March 20, 2023 received the payment on April 3, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.16 per share.

At the current share price of $11.19 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 5.54%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 4.47%, the lowest has been 2.83%, and the highest has been 8.57%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.01 (n=237).

The current dividend yield is 1.05 standard deviations above the historical average.

Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.40. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.

The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.03%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time.

https://www.investmentnews.com/credit-suisse-deal-will-make-ubs-a-wealth-management-powerhouse-jpmorgan-236257,Credit Suisse deal will make UBS a wealth management ‘powerhouse’: JPMorgan,"UBS Group’s $3.3 billion acquisition of rival Credit Suisse Group will transform it into a banking juggernaut at a bargain price, JPMorgan analysts said Tuesday.

The deal is set to turn UBS into a wealth management “powerhouse” with “one of the most attractive business models in global banking,” analysts led by Kian Abouhossein said in a research note. Meanwhile, the price paid is “attractive” for UBS even after factoring in potential losses on Credit Suisse assets, litigation costs and restructuring expenses, they said.

UBS bought Credit Suisse last month in a deal orchestrated by the Swiss government, following a collapse in confidence at the lender that threatened to trigger a broader financial crisis. UBS, already one of the world’s largest wealth managers, is now taking over a key rival for a fraction of the value of its assets and as much as 9 billion Swiss francs ($9.9 billion) in government loss guarantees.

UBS shares plunged after the deal announcement but they have since gained more than 10% as investors increasingly seem to see the terms as positive. By comparison, the Bloomberg Europe 500 Banks And Financial Services Index — a benchmark for the industry as a whole — has only increased by about 5% over the same period.

“The transaction has potential to be very attractive on an economic return-on-investment basis,” the analysts wrote. They forecast that the combined group could generate $7 billion in wealth management pretax profit by 2027.

However, the government-orchestrated rescue of Credit Suisse has met with some discontent among the Swiss population and politicians, with some lawmakers voicing their frustration over the government’s use of emergency measures at a parliamentary session on Tuesday.

Job cuts at Credit Suisse’s Swiss operations following the takeover could be delayed if they become “a political issue,” the JPMorgan analysts said in their note. Risks to the smooth execution of the deal could end up forcing UBS to sell or float the Credit Suisse’s domestic universal bank, which would fetch at least $10 billion in such a scenario.

That would “more than offset” the amount spent on the acquisition of the group by UBS, they wrote.

REUTERS/Pierre Albouy















BASEL, April 5 (Reuters) - UBS's (UBSG.S) Chairman told the bank's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday that the takeover of rival Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) was a significant milestone for Switzerland and for the global financial industry.

Describing the transaction as ""the first merger of two globally systematically important banks,"" Colm Kelleher said it ""means a new beginning and huge opportunities ahead for the combined bank and for the Swiss financial center as a whole.""

Kelleher addressed shareholders for the fist time since the announcement of the takeover, urgently engineered and pushed through by the Swiss authorities last month.

Outlining UBS's strategy, Kelleher said the Credit Suisse takeover would help the bank to deliver value to the Swiss economy and accelerate its strategic plans to expand its position as the leading wealth manager, particularly through growth in the United States and Asia.

Swiss authorities defended the state-brokered merger of the country’s two largest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, in an emergency parliamentary session called to scrutinise the decision.

The Swiss President, Alain Berset, argued “the Federal Council was obliged to intervene to maintain stability both in Switzerland and internationally and to protect the economy.”

“A failure of Credit Suisse would have had disastrous consequences,” he said.

The emergency session, only the third in over twenty years, cannot annul the deal as it has already been confirmed by a small group of senior MPs.

One of those MPs, Peter Hegglin, also stressed that there was no other option to the takeover, although he remained critical of Credit Suisse’s leadership team.

“The decision wasn’t easy for me,” he said. “The banking industry was warned by the 2008 crisis — unfortunately, Credit Suisse’s leadership didn’t learn from the crisis,” he said.

“Like in a dramatic tragedy, the managers destroyed values and made themselves rich in the process,” Hegglin continued.

Other parliamentarians hit out at the takeover. “Credit Suisse’s leadership has to take responsibility for its actions, that’s not only dictated by fairness,” Hansjoerg Knecht said.

“Tens of thousands of employees worry for their jobs,” he continued.

In March, UBS acquired Credit Suisse for a discount $3.25bn in an attempt to preserve the global financial system from a wider meltdown. In effect the deal is backstopped by the Swiss government, which has assured liquidity assistance for the newly merged entity.

While the parliamentarians cannot overturn the deal, they can signal their discontent and raise questions about the likely impact the takeover will have on the Swiss economy.

The emergency session is expected to go on for a few days and lawmakers are expected to raise concerns about possible job cuts and the impact on the economy of having one bank which is more than twice the size of the entire Swiss economy.

The Swiss Bank Employees’ Association wrote a letter to the Swiss parliament earlier today demanding that any job cuts be frozen. Reports last month suggested that UBS would cut up to a third of the bank’s workforce.

The deal has been deeply unpopular with shareholders, politicians and the broader public. The country’s two largest political parties have already both expressed discontent with the takeover in different ways.

In Japan last week the Fair Trade Commission reprimanded Mizuho Securities for, in its view, setting IPO prices too low. That looks harsh. The period in question, between June 2020 and May 2021, was a much better market for equities than now, but IPO pricing is always a fine art. A heavily oversubscribed book could fall away if an issuer raises the price, and a well covered deal doesn’t always trade well. The FTC is criticising Mizuho for its decisions not to price deals higher, arguing that the secondary market showed the shares were undervalued. In the absence of evidence that there was something specifically nefarious going on, that implies the FTC can identify the ideal amount for a stock to rise on its debut – which is quite a claim. Companies will only know they maximised their IPO pricing if their shares trade down on listing, which isn’t a great outcome for them either if they want to keep investors engaged for future equity raising. Instead of prescribing the right pricing or degree of first-day gains, regulators should stay out of the way. As long as markets are fair and transparent, pricing is a matter of opinion. Which takes us to China, which last week saw the first batch of main board Shanghai and Shenzhen IPOs using a new system under which the China Securities Regulatory Commission removed restrictions on size and pricing, and introduced less rigid trading limits. The old rules capped IPO valuations at a price-to-earnings multiple of 23, but companies are now free to price above that, and some in the new batch did so. If that implies those IPOs had come at rich pricing, the first-day trading sent a different message, with all 10 stocks soaring to gains of between 47.9% and 221.5%. Despite a softening over subsequent trading days, all 10 were above their IPO prices at the end of the week. In other words, given the freedom to achieve higher valuations, the companies still delivered good secondary trading performances. That looks like a good outcome for issuers and investors alike. But that won’t necessarily be the case for all issuers that follow. China tends to pick the strongest candidates to lead market reforms, so these were sought-after companies. While China’s rigorous screening of IPO candidates shouldn’t let through weak names, not all companies will receive the same reception from investors. China has taken big strides in recent years to focus on removing unfair practices from IPO bookbuilding – for example, banning some institutional investors in 2021 for colluding in the bidding process to drive down prices for Star and ChiNext IPOs, in the ECM equivalent of Libor rigging. Now it is focused on making sure the right companies go public, rather than being fixated on their share prices. It is quite a development that regulators in China – at least those overseeing listings – understand the value of market-based pricing better than some others in more developed markets. Place your bets Gambling company Lottomatica has launched the first major IPO in Europe since Easter. That should be good news for an equity capital market still on its knees, even though the deal’s proceeds are likely to be close to half the expected €1bn size. The only floats in the region this year, by Ionos and EuroGroup Laminations, handed double-digit percentage losses to participants, continuing a pattern seen in 2022 when most IPOs in Europe delivered losses. Investors are naturally nervous about backing another loser. So will they be encouraged by the smaller size for Lottomatica? A smaller deal means owner Apollo is selling fewer shares. That is a positive, as new investors are never keen to see shareholders heading out the door at the same time as selling via an IPO. On the face of it, less stock to sell overall – with only €425m of primary funds fixed so",[],

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter has confirmed that UBS’s multi-billion state-sponsored takeover of Credit Suisse should proceed smoothly without any political obstructions.

Credit Suisse’s rescue

In an interview with the newspaper, Finanz und Wirtschaft, published on Saturday, Keller-Sutter stated that she does not see any stumbling blocks at the moment.

The Swiss parliament is due to hold an extraordinary session next week to discuss the emergency merger engineered by Swiss authorities after Credit Suisse came close to collapse.

UBS and Credit Suisse will create a combined bank with $1.6 trillion in assets – double the size of the entire Swiss economy – and more than 120,000 staff.

Keller-Sutter emphasized that completing the merger is the highest priority, and the government’s intervention last month, which critics have said came too late and promised too much taxpayer support for a bank that paid out billions in bonuses to executives, was aimed at ensuring the stability of the Swiss economy and the Swiss financial center and to prevent an international financial crisis.

The primary goal of the Federal Council was to ensure the stability of the Swiss economy and the Swiss financial center and to prevent an international financial crisis. Under the circumstances, it was and is the best possible choice, which also places the least burden on the state and the taxpayer. Karin Keller-Sutter

Keller-Sutter criticized the culture at Credit Suisse, which she said had set the wrong incentives and had not learned from previous scandals and prosecutions. She also defended the writedown of AT1 bonds to zero, a controversial part of the rescue. “These are high-risk bonds with high yields, sometimes over 9%,” Keller-Sutter said. “The prospectus for these bonds makes it clear that if a company claims indirect government aid, they can be written off.”

UBS’s Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti has told Credit Suisse staff it is “critical” to remain focused on clients and keeping the business running as the merger of the two banks proceeds, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

“We cannot let ourselves get overly distracted by the integration efforts,” Ermotti said in the memo. “It’s critical for us to remain focused on supporting our clients and maintaining operational excellence.”

Parliament’s special session

The special parliamentary session next week was important, she added, and a welcome opportunity to get to the truth of the Credit Suisse debacle.

Keller-Sutter also commented that UBS will have to hold more equity after the takeover, which will rather force them to shrink, and that the risks to the taxpayer were also acceptable – even though the government could assume up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS by the takeover.

Sergio Ermotti has also tried to calm the nerves of anxious employees worried about massive layoffs and upheaval ahead. In his first communication to Credit Suisse staff after taking over as UBS CEO, Ermotti said there would be “change and hard decisions” ahead.

Still, he tried to reassure them by emphasizing that it is critical for UBS to remain focused on supporting their clients and maintaining operational excellence during the merger process.",[],

GENEVA (AP) — The UBS chairman voiced confidence Wednesday that the Swiss bank will succeed in a government-engineered takeover of hobbled rival Credit Suisse, pledging the deal will reduce costs, benefit shareholders and buttress Swiss finance despite “huge” risks in knitting the global lenders together.

Speaking to UBS shareholders, Colm Kelleher gave an overview of the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.25 billion) takeover that he said would close in the next few months, alluding to the complexity of the first-ever merger of two “global systemically important banks.”

Swiss government officials and regulators hastily orchestrated the deal that was announced on March 19 after Credit Suisse’s stock plunged and jittery depositors quickly pulled out their money.

Authorities feared that a teetering Credit Suisse could further roil global financial markets following the collapse of two U.S. banks.

“Whilst we did not initiate these discussions, we believe that this transaction is financially attractive for UBS shareholders,” Kelleher said at the annual shareholders meeting in the Swiss city of Basel. “I’m convinced that we made the right choice.""

Kelleher said fully integrating the banks is expected to take three to four years and that while UBS is “laser-focused on integrating Credit Suisse,” there are possible pitfalls.

“There is a huge amount of risk in integrating these businesses,” he said. “But let me assure you, we are doing everything to execute this deal in the best possible way in order not to let it compromise our financial strength or stability.”

UBS executives did not face the same outcry that Credit Suisse shareholders unleashed a day earlier at what was likely the 167-year-old bank’s last annual general meeting. On Tuesday, Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann acknowledged the anger and apologized for the failures leading up to the bank’s rescue.

The Swiss attorney general’s office has opened a probe into events surrounding Credit Suisse ahead of the UBS takeover, and the executive branch on Wednesday ordered tens of millions in cuts to the bonuses of top Credit Suisse executives.

(Georgios Kefalas/Keystone via AP)

Swiss regulators, meanwhile, said the takeover was “the best option,” offering the least risk of fanning a wider crisis and damaging Switzerland’s standing as a financial center.

The merger “minimized risk of contagion and maximized trust,"" said Urban Angehrn, chief executive of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or FINMA.

Two other solutions — a takeover by the Swiss government or putting Credit Suisse into insolvency proceedings — had serious drawbacks, he said Wednesday.

Insolvency would have left the functional parts of Credit Suisse in operation as a Swiss-only bank, but one with a “damaged reputation” through bankruptcy, he told reporters in the Swiss capital of Bern. A temporary takeover by the Swiss government would have exposed taxpayers to the risk of losses.

“One can well imagine what devastating effect the insolvency of a big wealth management bank of Credit Suisse AG would have had on Swiss private banking,” Angehrn said. “Many other Swiss banks could have faced a bank run, just as Credit Suisse did itself in the fourth quarter.”

The world’s biggest banks, including Credit Suisse and UBS, are required to submit emergency plans for winding them up if they fail, emerging from international negotiations aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2008 global financial crisis triggered by the failure of globally connected U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers.

Triggering such an emergency plan “would have achieved its immediate aim” of preserving payments and supporting the economy in Switzerland, Angehrn said.

“But the damage to Switzerland as a place to do business, to the reputation of Switzerland, to tax revenue and jobs, would have been enormous,” he said.

Shareholders did not get to vote on the merger after the Swiss government passed an emergency ordinance to bypass that step.

Kelleher acknowledged that the government-organized deal meant UBS shareholders could not be consulted before the takeover was announced.

“I understand that not all stakeholders of UBS and Credit Suisse are pleased with this approach,” he said.

At the meeting, UBS shareholders approved reelection of the board, compensation for executives and a 10% increase to the 2022 dividend, totaling $7.3 billion after the bank recorded a net profit of $7.6 billion last year.

Swiss regulators explained Wednesday that last month's controversial decision to sell off the country's troubled Credit Suisse bank cheaply was the best available solution to limit the risk of contagion to the global financial system. File Photo by Hugo Philpott/UPI | License Photo

April 5 (UPI) -- Switzerland's financial regulator sought Wednesday to justify the controversial decision made by the government and central bank to sell Credit Suisse to rival UBS for $3.2 billion, imposing massive losses on investors. The Financial Markets Authority, or FINMA, said that following a six-month run on the bank it had four pre-prepared options on the day -- two of them ready to be signed -- resolution, nationalization, bankruptcy or a takeover. Advertisement

Resolution and temporary nationalization were ruled out due to requiring more state funds and 100% investor bail-ins while the contagion risk to the global financial system of bankruptcy was considered so high that a takeover was deemed the least harmful solution, FINMA said.

""After carefully weighing up the advantages and disadvantages and the potential upsides and downsides, everyone involved came to the same conclusion,"" CEO Urban Angehrn said. ""In this specific situation, a takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS was the best option available.""

Advertisement

Anghern said the merger was the option that would most likely ""stabilize the situation"" and prevent the crisis from spreading further.

""As a global systemically important institution, Credit Suisse is not just any bank. The nature of the bank's business means it is highly interconnected with other market participants, both in Switzerland and globally,"" he said.

Angehrn said the current fragile state of the financial markets due to the shift to monetary tightening in 2022, the uncertain economic outlook, the Silicon Valley Bank and Signatures Bank crises in the United States and the whole geopolitical backdrop were also relevant to the decision.

RELATED Swiss prosecutor to investigate UBS takeover of Credit Suisse

""There was a high probability that the resolution of a global systemically important bank would have led to contagion effects and jeopardized financial stability in Switzerland and globally,"" he said.

The March 19 rescue deal saw Credit Suisse, which at the end of 2022 has assets of $1.4 trillion, sold for just $3.2 billion with shareholders receiving one UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares they held.

Already wounded from a series of scandals and incidents, withdrawals on a ""globally and historically unprecedented scale"" totaling $153 billion in the fourth quarter caused the market's assessment of Credit Suisse's business model and the future to falter.

FINMA said that was the trigger for it to enter into an even closer, daily exchange with the bank from this point on, and in particular closely monitor Credit Suisse's liquidity situation.

A Federal Department of Finance-led steering committee was set up and met repeatedly with FINMA's committee on financial crises along with the Swiss National Bank.

Credit Suisse was ordered to prove it had contingency measures in place including risk reduction and strengthening capital and liquidity and to do everything possible to prepare for a potential sale, including finding a buyer.

But that effort was overtaken by last month's mini-banking crisis in the United States which threatened to topple Credit Suisse, forcing FINMA and SNB to cobble together the merger with rival UBS behind closed doors on a Sunday afternoon.

The deal has been mired in controversy ever since with FINMA forced to defend a decision ordering Credit Suisse to write down $17 billion worth of junior bonds to zero, UBS' CEO replaced and the country's top prosecutor launching a criminal probe into the takeover.",['Paul Godfrey'],2023-04-05 00:00:00

Analyst Price Forecast Suggests 24.68% Upside

As of April 6, 2023, the average one-year price target for Western Union is $13.80. The forecasts range from a low of $10.10 to a high of $18.90. The average price target represents an increase of 24.68% from its latest reported closing price of $11.07.

See our leaderboard of companies with the largest price target upside.

The projected annual revenue for Western Union is $4,199MM, a decrease of 6.18%. The projected annual non-GAAP EPS is $1.63.

Western Union Declares $0.24 Dividend

On February 7, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share ($0.94 annualized). Shareholders of record as of March 17, 2023 received the payment on March 31, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.24 per share.

At the current share price of $11.07 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 8.49%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 4.56%, the lowest has been 2.83%, and the highest has been 8.89%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.15 (n=237).

The current dividend yield is 3.42 standard deviations above the historical average.

Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.39. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.

The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.04%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time.

Addressing the annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, Kelleher said that the takeover will take at least three to four years to take shape, excluding Credit Suisse’s non-core investment bank portfolio, which will have more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Describing the transaction as ""the first merger of two globally systematically important banks,"" Kelleher said the takeover ""means a new beginning and huge opportunities ahead for the combined bank and for the Swiss financial center as a whole.""

“Having a clear vision and a sound strategy is important….This transaction is the first merger of two global systemically important banks. This is not in any way an easy deal to do and brings with it execution risk,” Kelleher said.

Last month, Swiss authorities announced that UBS would buy Credit Suisse in a shotgun merger to contain further banking turmoil after the global lender had come to the brink of collapse. Kelleher’s address on Wednesday was the first meeting after the announcement, where 1,128 shareholders gathered.

He added that UBS will focus on its wealth management and Swiss business and confirmed that the bank would reduce the capital allocated to its investment arm to below 25 per cent of risk-weighted assets.

Outlining UBS's strategy, Kelleher said the Credit Suisse takeover would help the bank to deliver value to the Swiss economy and accelerate its strategic plans to expand its position as the leading wealth manager worldwide, particularly through growth in prominent markets like the US and Asia.

“Whilst we did not initiate these discussions, we believe that this transaction is financially attractive to UBS shareholders,” Kelleher said.

He added that there is a “huge amount of risk” associated with the integration, which will have more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Kelleher said UBS expects to remain well capitalised and “significantly above” its capital targets by the time the deal closes.

In 2022, UBS reported a full-year profit of $7.6 billion, while its shares gained more than 10 per cent since the turn of the year.

Last week, UBS said it had rehired Sergio Ermotti as the new chief executive to steer the massive takeover, which came as a surprise move.

Experts feel Ermotti’s return to the bank was planned to restore calm, as the country’s long-established reputation for financial stability was shaken after the Credit Suisse crisis.

On Tuesday, Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann, while addressing the last AGM of the flagship bank, apologised to the shareholders for failing to contain the crisis, which led to its closure. In an emotional speech at Credit Suisse's last annual general meeting, chairman Axel Lehmann spoke of being caught off guard, pain, bitterness, accumulated scandals, and the grief that remains.

In his opening address at the last AGM, Lehmann said that he had run out of time to turn the bank around, despite his belief ""until the beginning of the fateful week"" that it could survive. He said: ""It is a sad day. For all of you, and us. The bitterness, anger, and shock of all those who are disappointed, overwhelmed, and affected by the developments of the past few weeks are palpable.""

Earlier it was reported that the merger could see up to 36,000 jobs being cut across the world. On Sunday, Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung Weekly said management was mulling cutting between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of the workforce, meaning between 25,000 and 36,000 jobs across countries.

https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ubs-faces-investors-after-shotgun-credit-suisse-merger-2023-04-05/,UBS tells investors 'Herculean' Credit Suisse takeover will pay off,"













BASEL, April 5 (Reuters) - UBS (UBSG.S) executives sought to assure investors on Wednesday that Switzerland's largest bank can make its unexpected takeover of Swiss rival Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) work and pay off for its shareholders.

While describing the biggest bank rescue since the global financial crisis as a milestone for the industry and a major challenge for the bank, Chairman Colm Kelleher told UBS shareholders it also meant ""a new beginning and huge opportunities ahead for the combined bank and for the Swiss financial center as a whole.""

Last month, Swiss authorities announced that UBS would buy Credit Suisse in a shotgun merger to stem further banking turmoil after the smaller lender had come to the brink of collapse.

After a run on deposits, the Swiss government had turned to UBS, which agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), while the Alpine state put up more than 200 billion francs of support and guarantees.

Kelleher told the bank's shareholder meeting in Basel UBS was confident in its ability to successfully manage Credit Suisse's integration and that the combined bank would remain well capitalized.

""We believe the transaction is financially attractive for UBS shareholders,"" he said.

The hastily arranged rescue, not only angered and unsettled both banks' shareholders, but also many in Switzerland.

A survey by political research firm gfs.bern found a majority of Swiss did not support the deal that would create a financial institution with assets double the size of the country's annual economic output.

As shareholders expressed their frustration about being kept in the dark, with one calling it ""an insult,"" some also voiced concerns about potential job losses and the new giant bank's adverse impact on competition.

Vice Chairman Lukas Gaehwiler sought to quell such fears saying there were around 250 banks in the country and therefore enough competition.

He also said it was too early to speculate about jobs before the ""Herculean task"" of the merger had completed, which he expected to happen within a few months.

On Sunday, Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger cited an unnamed senior UBS manager as saying that the workforce of the combined group could shrink by 20-30%.

ALL OPTIONS ON TABLE

Gaehwiler also said that ""all options are on the table"" concerning Credit Suisse's domestic business, which would continue to operate under its old brand in Switzerland for the foreseeable future.

Shareholders also took aim at the executives' pay and bonus packages, which made Ralph Hamers the best paid chief executive in Switzerland in 2022.

In contrast to its smaller rival, UBS had been on a steady course. It reported a net profit of $7.6 billion for 2022 and strong inflows in wealth management, the company's flagship division.

Looking at how to navigate the mammoth task of integrating Credit Suisse, the success of which Switzerland depends on, UBS has already taken the first steps. Last week, the bank announced it had rehired Sergio Ermotti as chief executive to steer the massive takeover - a surprise move to take advantage of the Swiss banker's experience rebuilding the bank after the global financial crisis.

Addressing shareholders for the final time as chief executive, Hamers acknowledged the merger has led to new priorities for the bank, bringing a change at its helm.

""The acquisition of Credit Suisse will be a major challenge,"" Hamers said, while echoing the bank's chairman in highlighting new opportunities.

""It is expected to create a business with more than USD 5 trillion in total invested assets,"" he said.

On Wednesday UBS shareholders re-elected Kelleher as chairman, as well as all existing members of the board of directors, and approved their and bank executives' compensation.

Wednesday also marked Ermotti's first official day back in the job, although he did not attend the meeting.

It came a day after executives at Credit Suisse faced their own shareholders and Chairman Axel Lehmann apologised for leading the bank to the verge of bankruptcy.

In the face of growing criticism, Switzerland's financial regulator deflected blame for the collapse of Credit Suisse, saying it had been quick to respond, calling instead for more powers to take lenders to task.

On Tuesday, Reuters also reported that the Bank of England had approved UBS' takeover of Credit Suisse in Britain, a key market for the Swiss lenders racing to close the rescue deal.

UBS also secured a temporary green light from European Union antitrust regulators to complete its acquisition of Credit Suisse, but will still have to request clearance under EU merger rules, the European Commission said.

UBS’ stock (NYSE: UBS) has gained 14% YTD, whereas the S&P500 has increased 7% over the same period. Further, at the current price of $20 per share, it is 13% below its fair value of $23 – Trefis’ estimate for UBS’s valuation. The bank agreed to acquire Credit Suisse earlier this month for $3.2 billion. Notably, the deal was pushed by Swiss regulators to bail out Credit Suisse from its difficult liquidity position. While details about the integration are yet to be officially disclosed, it is likely to take 3-4 years.

The Swiss bank posted better-than-expected profits in the fourth quarter of 2022, despite an 8% drop in total revenues to $8.03 billion. The top line suffered due to a 24% decrease in investment bank revenues, followed by a 31% decline in asset management, and a 5% drop in the global wealth management divisions. That said, the personal & corporate banking revenues grew 5% y-o-y driven by higher net interest income. Further, the noninterest expenses decreased 13% y-o-y, leading to an adjusted net income of $1.65 billion – up 23% y-o-y.

UBS’s net revenues marginally decreased to $34.56 billion in FY2022. It was driven by a 2% decrease in wealth management and an 8% drop in the investment bank units, almost offset by a 13% increase in asset management and a 1% rise in personal & corporate banking revenues. On the cost front, the operating expenses were reduced by 4% y-o-y, improving the adjusted net income by 2% y-o-y to $7.63 billion.

Moving forward, we forecast UBS’ revenues to remain around $35.23 billion in FY2023. Additionally, UBS’ adjusted net income margin is likely to remain around the same level as the previous year. It will likely result in an annual GAAP EPS of $2.32, which coupled with a P/E multiple of just just below 10x will lead to a valuation of $23.

Swiss banking giant UBS is reportedly considering retaining Credit Suisse AG’s private banking unit in India, making a possible return to the market. This comes after UBS agreed to buy rival Credit Suisse for $3.23 billion in stock last month, and assume up to $5.4 billion in losses.

According to a report in Bloomberg, the global head of wealth management at UBS, Iqbal Khan, met with Credit Suisse executives including the local lender’s wealth head Puneet Matta in Singapore. Khan then reportedly told the Credit Suisse staff that the wealth business in India is likely to be retained.

Khan was in Credit Suisse before he left for UBS in 2019. UBS had left India by 2014, exiting the country’s private-wealth market. The return is expected to pave the way for UBS into the market as the number of billionaires in India continues to rise.

As per the report, the merger would see large parts of Credit Suisse’s investment bank wind down. The lender has just over 40 wealth management employees and around 7,000 overall employees in the country.

The deal inked between UBS and Credit Suisse last month includes $108 billion in liquidity assistance for UBS and Credit Suisse from the Swiss central bank. The federal government is providing a loss guarantee of a maximum 9 billion Swiss francs to enable UBS take over Credit Suisse.

This will be activated if losses are actually incurred on this portfolio. In that eventuality, UBS would assume the first 5 billion francs, the federal government the next 9 billion francs, and UBS would assume any further losses, the government said.

Government must introduce more policies and offer more tax incentives to attract talent, family office head says

Wealthy clients from the Middle East, Europe and Asia are interested in setting up family offices in Hong Kong because of the government's new initiatives and opportunities in the Greater Bay Area, according to a top UBS executive.

""From my trip to the Middle East in February, a number of investors that I met have shown interest in setting up their family offices here in Asia, particularly in Hong Kong, because they are drawn to the opportunities in the Greater Bay Area,"" said Amy Lo, co-head of wealth management for Asia-Pacific at UBS and Hong Kong CEO.

Lo met many of the Swiss bank's clients from the US, UK, Switzerland, Thailand and mainland China, who travelled to Hong Kong to attend the Wealth for Good summit on March 24, the first major business event in the city after the removal all Covid restrictions.

The government organised the summit, which attracted more than 100 overseas tycoons and family office operators, to show the city was back to normal after three years of disruption caused by the pandemic. A range of initiatives were unveiled to promote the city as a family office hub.

The policies include a revamped investment-migration scheme, tax incentives and the creation of art-storage facilities at the airport.

""UBS has proactively reached out to families to introduce the new policies and discuss what it means to them, how they can benefit and help them preserve wealth and legacy,"" Lo told the Post in an exclusive interview, adding that the measures touch on issues close to family offices such as investing, art and philanthropy.

""We are confident that these initiatives will positively shape Hong Kong's development as an international centre for family offices.""

Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po in his budget in February announced the government would allocate HK$100 million (US$12.8 million) to promote family offices, while in October, Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu set a target of attracting 200 large family offices to the city by 2025.

Lo said the Hong Kong government's promotion came at the right time as many wealthy families in the West, Middle East and Asia are eyeing new markets to invest their wealth.

""We have seen more diversification in our clients' investments, particularly into alternatives, such as private markets and hedge funds, and across different markets,"" she said.

""We will continue to see the shift of investments from all over the world to Asia where growth is.""

The Asia-Pacific economy is expected to grow at 4.3 per cent in 2023, while mainland China's gross domestic product is expected to grow at 5.4 per cent this year, according to forecasts from UBS. The Chinese government has set a growth target of around 5 per cent of the nation's economy for 2023.

Patrick Tsang, chairman of Tsangs Group, who set up a family office in Hong Kong in 2017 with a focus on innovation and technology investments globally, urged the government to offer more tax incentives and introduce more measures to attract talent.

""To attract more family offices to Hong Kong, the government is on the right track, but it could do more [such as offer] more tax incentives, and make it easier not just for business owners but also for the people that they hire from overseas to get them to come over,"" Tsang said. ""We need to showcase the Greater Bay Area's attractiveness.""

Beijing introduced the Greater Bay Area project in February 2019 to turn nine cities in southern Guangdong province, Hong Kong and Macau into an integrated economic powerhouse.

Tsangs Group will continue to be based in Hong Kong and tap China and the Greater Bay Area, highlighting the importance of Hong Kong as a superconnector between China and the world.

""The government should work on promoting the [potential] of the Greater Bay Area, and the different kinds of investment opportunities it can bring,"" said Tsang.

https://www.retaildive.com/news/50k-stores-may-close-2027-ubs/647392/,More than 50K stores may close by 2027: UBS,"Dive Brief:

Slowing consumer spending, reduced availability of credit and rising penetration of e-commerce may contribute to the closure of 50,000 retail stores by 2027, UBS analysts led by Michael Lasser said in a report published Tuesday. That forecast is based on the assumption that 25% of online orders will be fulfilled by a retail store by 2027, up from 15% now.

If online penetration reaches 28-29% with 2.5% retail sales growth, up to 130,000 stores could close. Although that estimate is down from what UBS forecasted in 2021, with less access to capital needed to invest in omnichannel, smaller retail chains are most at risk of closing, the analysts said.

Retailers closed more stores than they opened in 2022, reversing a trend in 2021 that saw about 11,000 net stores added to the U.S. retail sector’s brick-and-mortar footprint. That trend is likely to continue “as a tough macro backdrop and shift in spending away from goods forces closures at smaller, undifferentiated retailers,” the analysts said.

Dive Insight:

Over 5,000 stores across all retail sectors have closed since January 2021 or are set to, according to UBS’s tally. “We believe this trend should continue in the years to come, with consumers consolidating their trips and shifting towards online channels. As underperforming retail stores are shuttered, it should help the store productivity of surviving locations,” the analysts said.

Excluding fuel and food service, the U.S. has a current base of about 940,000 retail stores.

UBS highlighted several factors that are driving retail store closures. They include higher costs, which raise the bar for keeping stores open; a decline in units per store in most retail sectors; and the likelihood that store closures will disproportionately affect smaller chains.

“We suspect the pace of store closures among smaller firms will accelerate going forward as online penetration climbs higher,” the analysts said.

From 2007 to 2019, firms with less than 500 employees closed about 40,000 stores, or 5% of their base, while retailers with more than 500 employees added 17,000 stores. The overall cost of doing business rose significantly in the last 12 months, due in part to higher wages. Retail hourly wages, which are typically the largest cost component of running a store, increased about 5% over the last years, the analysts said.

On top of that, retailers will need to increase store productivity by 4.5% annually as retail rents per square foot increase for neighborhood and community centers. “These costs will likely continue to move higher, increasing the hurdle rate to keep stores open,” UBS said.

About 14,000 of the estimated closings will be in the softlines sector. UBS forecasts that department stores and specialty retailers will remain net store closers. Retailers with a heavy mall presence are likely to continue store closings, but off-price retailers should grow units.

The report also singles out consumer electronics and home furnishings as retail sectors that also need to shrink their store footprint. Consumer electronics retailers should close about 9,000 stores, while home furniture stores should shrink by about 4,000 locations.

One change that’s become essential versus discretionary for retailers is an increasing embrace of digital investments like buy online, pay in store; ship from store; same-day delivery; and buy online, return in store. UBS says online retail spending per household was $9,900 in 2022, up from $8,900 a year ago and up from $4,000 in 2015. Companies with a strong DTC focus combined with high brand loyalty, like Nike and Levi’s, are best positioned for the ongoing shift to digital fulfillment.

And, the report notes, in-store fulfillment of digital orders may reduce the risk of store closures, especially for brands and specialty retailers. That shift to individual stores serving as digital fulfillment centers may also reduce the chance that unprofitable stores will close.",['Nate Delesline Iii'],2023-04-12 12:06:00

Investment bank UBS has signed a 12-year lease for 23,644 square feet at Skanska’s 17xM office tower in Downtown Washington, D.C., which is currently under construction.

This is the second lease at the property after law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher announced it would anchor the 11-story property at 1700 M Street NW, having signed a lease for 163,715 square feet back in 2021, Commercial Observer reported at the time.

Together the two leases bring the 334,000-square-foot property to 56 percent pre-leased.

Construction at the Kohn Pedersen Fox-designed building topped out last month, and it is scheduled for completion in 2024, at which point UBS will relocate, moving from its current offices at 1501 K Street NW, according to Skanska. The project was estimated to cost $216 million when the company first broke ground in 2021.

Skanska signed a long-term ground lease with JBG Smith in 2019, which owns the 34,000-square-foot property to develop on the site.

Brian Raher at Cushman & Wakefield represented UBS, while CBRE’s Randy Harrell, Jill Goubeaux, Joe Coleman and Lara Nealon represented Skanska in the deal, and are marketing the available space in the property.

https://www.complianceweek.com/risk-management/ubs-prepping-for-herculean-task-of-integrating-credit-suisse/32927.article,UBS prepping for ‘Herculean task’ of integrating Credit Suisse,"Senior leadership at UBS acknowledged the significant work ahead of Switzerland’s largest bank as it begins preparing to absorb the country’s second-largest bank, Credit Suisse.

“Both banks have to be continued and integrated in the coming years,” said Lukas Gähwiler, UBS’s vice chairman of the board of directors, during the bank’s annual general meeting of shareholders Wednesday. “This is a Herculean task that will need more rather than fewer people in the short run.”

UBS announced March 19 it would purchase Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs (U.S. $3.3 billion) after the latter institution was deemed at risk of becoming illiquid as depositors raced to withdraw their funds from the bank. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) stepped in to help coordinate the merger once it determined recent initiatives undertaken by Credit Suisse to overhaul its risk management practices and restore its reputation weren’t enough to restore confidence in the bank.

Gähwiler said UBS had only 48 hours to carry out due diligence before the takeover was announced.

“Our primary priority is to stabilize Credit Suisse’s client business,” he said. “We did not go looking for this transaction. But everyone concerned agreed that a takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS would minimize the damage for Switzerland and the insecurity on international financial markets.”

He estimated the merger would likely take months to complete and that working at speed is paramount to stem the “great uncertainty” lingering while the deal is underway. Another issue facing the planned acquisition is an investigation launched by Swiss prosecutors earlier this week to determine if criminal offenses were committed while the rushed transaction was executed.

UBS has already made changes to its executive ranks to prepare for the Credit Suisse integration, announcing March 29 that Sergio Ermotti would return to the bank as group chief executive officer. Ermotti was previously the Group CEO of UBS for nine years and “successfully repositioned UBS following the severe challenges arising from the global financial crisis,” the bank said in its press release.

Ralph Hamers agreed to step down, effective Wednesday, to facilitate the change.

“Integrating Credit Suisse successfully is the most important task for UBS,” he told shareholders. “I am confident that the new CEO Sergio Ermotti, with his outstanding record and experience, will lead the firm safely through this next phase.”

Colm Kelleher, chairman of the UBS board of directors, also spoke Wednesday, acknowledging the Credit Suisse acquisition is not expected to halt other growth initiatives underway for the bank.

“Equally, risk management and control, including operational resilience, conduct, and prevention of financial crime, remain key focus areas of the board of directors,” he said.

At Credit Suisse’s annual meeting Tuesday, Board Chairman Axel Lehmann apologized to shareholders regarding’s the bank’s swift downfall, saying he and the rest of its leadership did the best they could to avert collapse.

“The period from October to March was not long enough,” he said. “One legacy issue after another had already seen trust eroded—and with it, patience dwindled. At that, we failed. It was too late. The bitter reality is that there wasn’t enough time for our strategy to bear fruit.”",['Kyle Brasseur'],

FRANKFURT — Swiss banking giant UBS will buy the country’s second-largest bank Credit Suisse in a deal that will come as a relief to financial markets in Europe and across the world.

UBS said in a statement that the total price is 3 billion Swiss francs, or about $3.25 billion, in UBS shares.

The deal was pushed through in an effort to avoid further turmoil in global banking following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and another regional lender in the U.S.

“With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,” the Swiss National Bank said in a separate statement, noting that the deal was made possible with the support of the Swiss federal government, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA and the Swiss National Bank.

The central bank added that UBS and Credit Suisse can obtain a liquidity assistance loan of up to 100 billion francs.

Highlighting the urgency of securing a deal for the bank before markets open on Monday, Swiss authorities adjusted laws to allow further provision of liquidity by the Swiss central bank, while the government agreed to provide additional guarantees.

The expeditious rescue of Credit Suisse was welcomed by the European Central Bank as well as the Federal Reserve in the U.S.

The ""swift action"" by the Swiss authorities ""are instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said in a statement.

The 167-year-old Credit Suisse has been involved in a series of scandals that have undermined the confidence of investors and clients. It has thus found itself in the eye of the storm when the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank sparked fears of a banking crisis.","['More ...', 'Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority', 'Finma']",2023-03-19 19:15:09+00:00

Bloomberg

The voluntary production cuts by some members of the Opec+ group of crude producers should tighten the oil market further from May onwards and boost prices, Swiss lender UBS has said.

A drop in crude inventories and supply disruption from northern Iraq of almost 500,000 barrels per day are also supporting prices that could rally towards the $100 mark, UBS said in its latest oil market report on Tuesday.

“While flows may resume [from Iraq] in the short term, the interruption and the upcoming voluntary production cuts by nine oil producers should help tighten the oil market further,” UBS said in report co-authored by its strategists Giovanni Staunovo, Wayne Gordon and Dominic Schnider.

“As a result, we continue to expect oil prices to recover towards $100 per barrel over the coming quarters.”

Opec+ members including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman and Algeria on April 2 surprised the market and said they would introduce combined voluntary oil production cuts of 1.16 million barrels per day from May until the end of this year.

Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter and Opec's largest producer, will cut its output by 500,000 bpd from May until the end of the year, while the UAE will cut its output by 144,000 bpd for the same period.

Russia, which is part of the 23-member Opec+ group, said the 500,000 bpd cut it was implementing from March to June would continue until the end of the year.

The producers said the precautionary measure was aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market.

The latest pledge of cuts by Opec+, which slashed its collective output by two million barrels per day in October last year, has pushed the volume of the group’s production caps to about 3.6 million bpd, about 3.6 per cent of Opec’s 101.9 million bpd estimated world oil demand this year.

Goldman Sachs, which had reduced its oil price forecast for 2023 on growing supplies and lower demand, now expects Brent to trade at $95 a barrel by the end of this year from a previous $90 estimate, and $100 in 2024 compared with a prior $97 forecast.

The investment bank expects a nearly 90 per cent implementation rate for the 1.16 million bpd combined cut, as the countries that announced them “have a strong compliance track record” and had implemented nearly 90 per cent of the October 2022 cut by January 2023, the investment bank said earlier this month.

Crude prices have rebounded from a 15-month low hit last month due to a banking crisis in the US that spread to Switzerland, leading to the collapse of four lenders and sparking a broad sell-off in financial markets.

Brent, the benchmark for two thirds of the world’s oil, settled 1.7 per cent higher at $85.61 a barrel at the close of trading on Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate, the gauge that tracks US crude, closed up 2.2 per cent at $81.53 a barrel.

Oil is still up about 6 per cent since the Opec+ surprise announcement. However, traders are awaiting data on inflation and economy that will indicate global economic sentiment and potential demand for oil in the quarters to come.

“Given our positive price outlook, we reiterate our investment recommendations,” the UBS strategists said.

“With the oil futures curve downwards sloping (in backwardation) and higher prices likely ahead, we continue to advise risk-taking investors to add long positions in longer-dated Brent oil contracts.”

Falling inventories amid a rise in demand as China's economy, the second-largest in the world after the US, will also support crude prices.

“More interesting is the fall in inventories following the strong rise at the start of the year, which was likely driven by the dip in January demand due to mild weather and recovering production from weather disruptions in December,” UBS said.

However, February data suggested a strong increase in demand, resulting in a modestly undersupplied market that month, it added.

“More recent data shows renewed large on-land inventory drops of more than 30 million barrels over the last three weeks across the US, Europe, Singapore, Japan and Fujairah, suggesting that the market remained undersupplied in March as well,” it said.",[],

By Stefania Spezzati and Oliver Hirt

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England has approved UBS Group AG's takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG in the United Kingdom, people familiar with the process told Reuters, a key market for the Swiss lenders racing to close the rescue deal.

Reuters could not establish if any conditions have been requested for the approval, which comes less than three weeks since the takeover was announced and reflects the urgency surrounding the transaction.

Change of control approvals by regulators typically can take up to 60 working days to secure in Britain. Representatives for UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment.

On March 19, just after the deal was announced, the Bank of England said it welcomed ""the comprehensive set of actions set out by the Swiss authorities today in order to support financial stability,"" without elaborating.

UBS needs 58 countries to sign off on the combination that will make Switzerland biggest bank a wealth management giant with more than $3 trillion in assets. The longer the deal takes to close, the harder it could be for Credit Suisse to hold on to its business.

The United Kingdom, where Credit Suisse has $60 billion of risk-weighted assets primarily in its investment banking division, is one of its biggest markets outside of Switzerland.

UBS on Tuesday also secured a temporary green light from European Union antitrust regulators to complete its acquisition of Credit Suisse, but will still have to request clearance under EU merger rules, the European Commission said.

UBS Chief Executive Officer Ralph Hamers, who will step down on Wednesday after the annual shareholder meeting, told reporters on March 29 that ""plans can only partially be developed"" because Credit Suisse is still a separate company.

""That's why it's very important that we get the regulators support globally and as soon as possible,"" he said.

John Glen, chief secretary to the UK Treasury, said last week he did not have any immediate concerns about the execution of Switzerland's Credit Suisse rescue by UBS.

The Swiss Finance Minister, Karin Keller-Sutter, has stated that the multi-billion state-sponsored takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS is expected to proceed smoothly without political obstructions. The Swiss parliament will hold an extraordinary session next week to discuss the emergency merger, which was engineered by the Swiss authorities after Credit Suisse nearly collapsed. To back the takeover and avoid a financial meltdown, the bank was offered nearly 260 billion Swiss francs ($287 billion) of liquidity support and state guarantees.

Keller-Sutter defended the government's intervention, stating that the primary goal of the Federal Council was to ensure the stability of the Swiss economy and financial centre and prevent an international financial crisis. Completing the merger was the highest priority, according to the minister. She also stated that the risks to the taxpayer were acceptable, even though the government could assume up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS by the takeover.

The new combined bank will have $1.6 trillion in assets and more than 120,000 staff. Keller-Sutter also commented on the structure of UBS, stating that it would have to be considered in the future. She explained that UBS would have to hold more equity after the takeover, which could force them to shrink. Switzerland's Competition Commission can also make recommendations, the minister added.

Keller-Sutter criticized the culture at Credit Suisse, which she said had set the wrong incentives and had not learned from previous scandals and prosecutions. She also defended the write-down of AT1 bonds to zero, a controversial part of the rescue. According to Keller-Sutter, these are high-risk bonds with high yields, sometimes over 9%, and the prospectus for these bonds makes it clear that if a company claims indirect government aid, they can be written off.

The special parliamentary session next week was important, she added, and a welcome opportunity to get to the truth of the Credit Suisse debacle. While parliament can ""only"" advise on the commitment credit at the moment, it also has the opportunity to comment on the case and play an active role in the process. Overall, the Finance Minister is optimistic that the merger will proceed smoothly without major political obstacles.

The stock picks include companies from different regions and sectors, which were selected using quantitative models and further scrutinized by UBS sector analysts. The Swiss bank's analysts found that the U.S. is considered the safest region for dividends, with a low probability of a dividend cut at 6.2%. In a report titled ''Global High-Quality Dividend Stock List,"" UBS highlighted that all sectors of U.S. stock markets also appear relatively safe in terms of dividend growth prospects. ""This quarter, the U.S. is the most preferred region in terms of dividend growth (previously Japan) with a forecast growth rate of 5.4%,"" the bank's analysts wrote in a note to clients on April 3. But despite that positive outlook on the performance of dividends across various markets, UBS cautioned that its estimates do not take into account crises or market challenges unless they've already affected the stock at a more fundamental level. The table below shows 10 ""high-quality dividend stocks"" with the biggest dividend yield forecast. While the top five dividend payers are from Europe and Japan, UBS sees stocks there generally underperforming compared with the United States. ""Dividend growth prospects in Pacific ex Japan and Europe are negative, and Real Estate in Europe has the worst growth forecast at -18.7%,"" said the UBS analysts led by Claire Jones. UBS expects Italian companies such as supermajor oil company Eni , UniCredit and Fiat-Chrysler parent Stellantis will yield more than 5%. Energy has been forecast to have the largest dividend growth globally, while communication services have seen no increase in their projected yield. Deutsche Bank was also among the stocks with a forecast yield of more than 5%. The consensus price target of all analysts covering the bank's stock points toward a 49% upside. Shares of the German lender have fallen by more than 15% since the banking crisis in mid-March. UBS said the basket of high-dividend-yielding stocks beat lower-yielding ones across most regions except Japan, where yields remained flat during the first quarter of this year.

ZURICH, April 6 (Reuters) - UBS (UBSG.S) Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti has told Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) staff it is ""critical"" to remain focused on clients and keeping the business running as the merger of the two banks proceeds, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

""We cannot let ourselves get overly distracted by the integration efforts,"" Ermotti said in the memo. ""It's critical for us to remain focused on supporting our clients and maintaining operational excellence.""

Last month, Swiss authorities announced that UBS would buy Credit Suisse in a shotgun merger to stem further banking turmoil after the smaller lender had come to the brink of collapse.

UBS announced last week it was rehiring Ermotti as CEO, its former boss from 2011 to 2020, to steer the takeover which will create one bank with $1.6 trillion in assets and more than 120,000 staff.

In his first communication to Credit Suisse staff after taking over as UBS CEO, Ermotti said there would be ""change and hard decisions"" ahead.

Still, he tried to calm the nerves of anxious employees worried about massive lay-offs and upheaval ahead.

The bank created by the merger is poised to reduce its workforce by 20%-30%, Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger reported at the weekend, citing an unnamed senior UBS manager.

UBS Vice Chairman Lukas Gaehwiler told the bank's shareholders on Wednesday that it was too early to speculate about job cuts.

Ermotti asked staff to be patient while the company worked out its next moves.

""While it’s too soon to speculate about the end state of the combined organization, you have my commitment that we will treat all employees of both Credit Suisse and UBS fairly,"" he wrote.

TCS management's remarks come a day after India's largest IT services exporter reported a five percent sequential increase in March quarter net profit to Rs 11,392 crore while the firm flagged worries from its key market of North America.

Events like the fall of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and fears of a contagion have impacted client sentiments in North America and the banking, financial services and insurance sector in particular, leading to clients deferring spends, the Tata Group company said.

Switzerland's biggest bank is absorbing its stricken closest domestic rival in a deal stitched together on March 19 out of fears of a global banking crisis if the floundering Credit Suisse went under.

But some UBS shareholders may have concerns closer to home as to what it means for their personal investments now the bank is taking on an institution that repeatedly got itself into trouble.

Shareholders of both banks had no say in the mega-merger, which was engineered behind closed doors by the Swiss government, the central bank and the financial regulators.

Wednesday's annual general meeting takes place in Basel, one of the two birthplaces of UBS along with Zurich.

The AGM is being held in the St. Jakobshalle indoor arena, famously the stomping ground of Swiss tennis great Roger Federer -- Credit Suisse's top brand ambassador.

The meeting will see Dutch chief executive Ralph Hamers bow out. Once the AGM is over, Sergio Ermotti returns as CEO, having been called back to UBS to handle the delicate integration process.

The 62-year-old Swiss banker ran UBS between 2011 and 2020, having been brought in to restructure and stabilise the bank after its state bailout during the 2008 global financial crisis, followed by the 2011 losses of a rogue trader who blew $2.3 billion.

UBS chairman Colm Kelleher said he felt Ermotti would be the ""better pilot"" for the bank's new flight path than the digital transformation-focused Hamers, who will stay on for a handover period.

UBS will become a banking colossus, with $5 trillion of invested assets.

Kelleher has voiced his concerns about not only the execution risks in carrying out the merger but also about the dangers of ""bad culture"" from Credit Suisse, primarily in its investment banking, bleeding into UBS.

There are also the numerous disputes accumulated by Credit Suisse that UBS will have to settle, after having already spent several years settling its own.

Roger Said, director of the Swiss shareholder organisation Actares, said that Ermotti ""will have to put an end to the irresponsible risk culture that has existed for years at Credit Suisse, as well as drastically reduce risky business sectors"".

The annual general meeting comes the day after Credit Suisse held its final AGM before the 167-year-old bank is swallowed up by UBS.

Credit Suisse chairman Axel Lehmann said he was ""truly sorry"" that the national institution could not be saved as he faced angry and tearful shareholders whose money has gone up in smoke.

He said that ""ultimately there were only two options: deal or bankruptcy"".

UBS shares closed up 0.2 percent Tuesday at 18.77 Swiss francs each, while the Swiss stock exchange dropped 0.2 percent.

Credit Suisse shareholders have seen the value of their investment plunge from 12.78 Swiss francs per share in February 2021 to the 0.76 francs they will receive in the $3.25-billion merger.

The Ethos foundation, which represents pension funds in Switzerland and owns stakes in both banks, said Credit Suisse shareholders were mobilising to get UBS to think about giving them more than 0.76 francs per share.

https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2023-04-05/swiss-regulators-defend-rescue-of-credit-suisse-via-ubs-deal,UBS Confident About Credit Suisse Deal Despite 'Huge' Risk,"GENEVA (AP) — The UBS chairman voiced confidence Wednesday that the Swiss bank will succeed in a government-engineered takeover of hobbled rival Credit Suisse, pledging the deal will reduce costs, benefit shareholders and buttress Swiss finance despite “huge” risks in knitting the global lenders together.

Speaking to UBS shareholders, Colm Kelleher gave an overview of the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.25 billion) takeover that he said would close in the next few months, alluding to the complexity of the first-ever merger of two “global systemically important banks.”

Swiss government officials and regulators hastily orchestrated the deal that was announced on March 19 after Credit Suisse’s stock plunged and jittery depositors quickly pulled out their money.

Authorities feared that a teetering Credit Suisse could further roil global financial markets following the collapse of two U.S. banks.

“Whilst we did not initiate these discussions, we believe that this transaction is financially attractive for UBS shareholders,” Kelleher said at the annual shareholders meeting in the Swiss city of Basel. “I’m convinced that we made the right choice.""

Kelleher said fully integrating the banks is expected to take three to four years and that while UBS is “laser-focused on integrating Credit Suisse,” there are possible pitfalls.

“There is a huge amount of risk in integrating these businesses,” he said. “But let me assure you, we are doing everything to execute this deal in the best possible way in order not to let it compromise our financial strength or stability.”

UBS executives did not face the same outcry that Credit Suisse shareholders unleashed a day earlier at what was likely the 167-year-old bank’s last annual general meeting. On Tuesday, Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann acknowledged the anger and apologized for the failures leading up to the bank’s rescue.

The Swiss attorney general’s office has opened a probe into events surrounding Credit Suisse ahead of the UBS takeover, and the executive branch on Wednesday ordered tens of millions in cuts to the bonuses of top Credit Suisse executives.

Swiss regulators, meanwhile, said the takeover was “the best option,” offering the least risk of fanning a wider crisis and damaging Switzerland’s standing as a financial center.

The merger “minimized risk of contagion and maximized trust,"" said Urban Angehrn, chief executive of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or FINMA.

Two other solutions — a takeover by the Swiss government or putting Credit Suisse into insolvency proceedings — had serious drawbacks, he said Wednesday.

Insolvency would have left the functional parts of Credit Suisse in operation as a Swiss-only bank, but one with a “damaged reputation” through bankruptcy, he told reporters in the Swiss capital of Bern. A temporary takeover by the Swiss government would have exposed taxpayers to the risk of losses.

“One can well imagine what devastating effect the insolvency of a big wealth management bank of Credit Suisse AG would have had on Swiss private banking,” Angehrn said. “Many other Swiss banks could have faced a bank run, just as Credit Suisse did itself in the fourth quarter.”

The world’s biggest banks, including Credit Suisse and UBS, are required to submit emergency plans for winding them up if they fail, emerging from international negotiations aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2008 global financial crisis triggered by the failure of globally connected U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers.

Triggering such an emergency plan “would have achieved its immediate aim” of preserving payments and supporting the economy in Switzerland, Angehrn said.

“But the damage to Switzerland as a place to do business, to the reputation of Switzerland, to tax revenue and jobs, would have been enormous,” he said.

Shareholders did not get to vote on the merger after the Swiss government passed an emergency ordinance to bypass that step.

Kelleher acknowledged that the government-organized deal meant UBS shareholders could not be consulted before the takeover was announced.

“I understand that not all stakeholders of UBS and Credit Suisse are pleased with this approach,” he said.

At the meeting, UBS shareholders approved reelection of the board, compensation for executives and a 10% increase to the 2022 dividend, totaling $7.3 billion after the bank recorded a net profit of $7.6 billion last year.

“We have laid the foundation that now puts us in a position to stabilize Credit Suisse for the benefit of both banks and the Swiss financial center,” Kelleher said.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/19/business/credit-suisse-ubs-rescue/index.html,UBS is buying Credit Suisse in bid to halt banking crisis,"London CNN —

Switzerland’s biggest bank, UBS, has agreed to buy its ailing rival Credit Suisse in an emergency rescue deal aimed at stemming financial market panic unleashed by the failure of two American banks earlier this month.

“UBS today announced the takeover of Credit Suisse,” the Swiss National Bank said in a statement Sunday. It said the rescue would “secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy.”

UBS is paying 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion) for Credit Suisse, about 60% less than the bank was worth when markets closed on Friday. Credit Suisse shareholders will be largely wiped out, receiving the equivalent of just 0.76 Swiss francs in UBS shares for stock that was worth 1.86 Swiss francs on Friday. Owners of $17 billion worth of “additional tier one” bonds — a riskier class of bank debt — will lose everything, Swiss regulators said.

Extraordinarily, the deal will not need the approval of shareholders after the Swiss government agreed to change the law to remove any uncertainty about the deal.

Credit Suisse (CS) had been losing the trust of investors and customers for years. In 2022, it recorded its worst loss since the global financial crisis. But confidence collapsed last week after it acknowledged “material weakness” in its bookkeeping and as the demise of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank spread fear about weaker institutions at a time when soaring interest rates have undermined the value of some financial assets.

Shares in the 167-year-old bank fell 25% over the week, money poured from investment funds it manages and at one point account holders were withdrawing deposits of more than $10 billion per day, the Financial Times reported. An emergency loan of nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank failed to stop the bleeding.

But it did “build a bridge” to the weekend, to allow the rescue to be pieced together, Swiss officials said Sunday night.

“This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue,” UBS chairman Colm Kelleher told reporters.

“It is absolutely essential to the financial structure of Switzerland and … to global finance,” he told reporters.

Desperate to prevent the meltdown spreading through the global financial system on Monday, Swiss authorities initiated the search for a private sector solution, with limited state support, while reportedly considering Plan B — a full or partial nationalization.

“Given recent extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances, the announced merger represents the best available outcome,” Credit Suisse chairman Axel Lehmann said in a statement.

“This has been an extremely challenging time for Credit Suisse and while the team has worked tirelessly to address many significant legacy issues and execute on its new strategy, we are forced to reach a solution today that provides a durable outcome.”

The emergency takeover was agreed to after a days of frantic negotiations involving financial regulators in Switzerland, the United States and United Kingdom. UBS (UBS) and Credit Suisse rank among the 30 most important banks in the global financial system, and together they have almost $1.7 trillion in assets.

Regulators applaud the takeover

Financial market regulators around the world cheered UBS’ action to take over Credit Suisse.

US authorities said they supported the action and worked closely with the Swiss central bank to assist the takeover.

“We welcome the announcements by the Swiss authorities today to support financial stability,” said US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a joint statement. “The capital and liquidity positions of the US. banking system are strong, and the US financial system is resilient.”

Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, said the banking sector remains resilient but the ECB stands at the ready to help banks maintain enough cash on hand to fund their operations if the need arises.

“I welcome the swift action and the decisions taken by the Swiss authorities,” Lagarde said. “They are instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.

The Bank of England said it welcomed the measures taken by the Swiss authorities “to support financial stability.”

“We have been engaging closely with international counterparts throughout the preparations for today’s announcements and will continue to support their implementation,” it said in a statement. “The UK banking system is well capitalized and funded, and remains safe and sound.”

How UBS and Credit Suisse will fit together

The global headquarters of UBS and Credit Suisse are just 300 yards apart in Zurich but the banks’ fortunes have been on very different paths recently. Shares of UBS have climbed 15% in the past two years, and it booked a profit of $7.6 billion in 2022. It had a stock market value of about $65 billion on Friday, according to Refinitiv.

Credit Suisse shares have lost 84% of their value over the same period, and last year it posted a loss of $7.9 billion. It was worth just $8 billion at the end of last week.

Dating back to 1856, Credit Suisse has its roots in the Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (SKA), which was set up to finance the expansion of the railroad network and industrialization of Switzerland.

In addition to being Switzerland’s second biggest bank, it looks after the wealth of many of the world’s richest people and offers global investment banking services. It had more than 50,000 employees at the end of 2022, 17,000 of those in Switzerland.

The Swiss National Bank said it would provide a loan of 100 billion Swiss francs ($108 billion) to UBS and Credit Suisse to boost liquidity.

UBS Chief Executive Ralph Hamers will be CEO of the combined bank, and Kelleher will serve as chairman.

The takeover will reinforce the position of UBS as the world’s leading wealth manager with $5 trillion of invested assets, and boost its ambition to grow in the Americas and Asia. UBS said it expects to generate cost savings of $8 billion per year by 2027. Credit Suisse’s investment bank is in the crosshairs.

“Let me be clear. UBS intends to downsize Credit Suisse’s investment banking business and align it with our conservative risk culture,” Kelleher said.",['Mark Thompson'],2023-03-19 00:00:00
https://nypost.com/2023/03/21/ubs-credit-suisse-takeover-could-layoff-tens-of-thousands/,Credit Suisse rescue reportedly could spur ‘tens of thousands’ of layoffs,"UBS Group’s emergency bailout of struggling lender Credit Suisse reportedly could result in “tens of thousands” of layoffs — and worried bankers are already said to be scrambling to contact recruiters.

The culling is expected to hit hardest at Credit Suisse’s operations in Switzerland and its investment bank, the Financial Times reported, citing sources familiar with UBS’s plans for the firm.

The report said the amount of lost jobs could be “as much as a third” of the 120,000 people employed at the combined operations of Credit Suisse and UBS.

“The takeover threatens job cuts on a scale that the labor market in the banking sector cannot absorb,” the Swiss Bank Employees’ Association said in a Tuesday statement, according to the outlet.

Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Korner and chair Alex Lehmann told staffers that no decisions have yet been made about potential layoffs.

Separately, a source told Bloomberg that the layoffs could amount to “multiples” of Credit Suisse’s current plan to slash 9,000 jobs, which was already in place before UBS took over the troubled lender.

Rumored layoffs have prompted an “unprecedented flood” of calls from Credit Suisse bankers to corporate headhunters and other firms as they look to secure new gigs ahead of the upheaval, Bloomberg reported, citing interviews with people at more than a dozen firms based in New York, London, Singapore and other cities.

One firm in Singapore told Bloomberg it had received calls from approximately 30 private bankers, mostly employed by Credit Suisse, on Monday alone.

A recruiter based in Hong Kong said they had fielded calls from more than 20 senior investment bankers over the last week, while another headquartered in London said inquiries were coming in “all weekend.”

“The best ones at Credit Suisse have probably already left,” Singapore-based recruiter Will Tan of Principal Partners told the outlet.

“There’s definitely not enough to go around for everyone,” Tan added.

Any ousted workers could face a difficult path to finding another job, given the current turmoil in the US banking system and abroad. Some banks, such as Goldman Sachs, have already conducted layoffs within the last few months.

Shares of Credit Suisse have cratered since last week, when top brass disclosed that they had discovered “material weaknesses” in the firm’s financial reporting over the last two years.

UBS’s government-brokered emergency rescue did little to assuage concerns, as Credit Suisse’s stock cratered by some 55% in the first day of trading after the announcement. UBS shares pared early losses and ended 1.2% higher on Monday.

The admission prompted a crisis of confidence among investors and raised fears of a collapse that could spread further contagion in a banking sector already rocked by the implosions of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank of New York.

“We are encouraging colleagues to continue to the best of their abilities against a difficult backdrop,” a Singapore-based Credit Suisse spokesperson told Bloomberg.

“Ultimately, we will do everything we can to ensure an orderly transition and to serve our clients as best as possible,” the spokesperson added.

UBS reportedly referred to its Sunday statement on the deal when asked for comment about the job situation.

“This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue,” UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said in the statement.

“We have structured a transaction which will preserve the value left in the business while limiting our downside exposure,” Kelleher added.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/29/business/ubs-new-ceo-sergio-ermotti-intl-hnk/index.html,Sergio Ermotti: UBS brings back ex-CEO to oversee Credit Suisse rescue,"Hong Kong/London CNN —

UBS is bringing back its former chief executive, Sergio Ermotti, to manage the hugely complex and risky task of completing the bank’s emergency takeover of rival Credit Suisse (CS).

The surprise appointment, announced Wednesday, highlights the scale of the challenge facing the Swiss lender as it executes a first-of-its-kind merger of two global banks with combined assets of nearly $1.7 trillion.

The Swiss government engineered the rescue 10 days ago as Credit Suisse teetered on the brink of collapse, a failure that would have rocked a global financial system already reeling from the second-biggest American banking collapse in history.

Ermotti was UBS (UBS) CEO between 2011 and 2020 and is credited with successfully overhauling the bank following its bailout during the 2008 financial crisis. He is seen as a safe pair of hands capable of integrating Credit Suisse and salvaging core parts of its business.

His second stint in the top job, which begins April 5, means the end of current CEO Ralph Hamers’ tenure after just two and a half years in the role, during which time the bank has delivered successive record results.

Hamers “has agreed to step down to serve the interests of the new combination, the Swiss financial sector and the country,” UBS said in a statement. Hamers will remain at the lender for a transition period.

UBS chairman Colm Kelleher thanked Hamers for his contribution but said the board felt Ermotti was “the better horse” for such a massive integration. “There’s a huge amount of risk in integrating these businesses,” Kelleher said at a press conference.

As a first order of business, Ermotti will need to cut thousands of jobs and downsize Credit Suisse’s investment bank, while aligning it with a more conservative risk culture — a task he is familiar with.

During his previous tenure as CEO, Ermotti “transformed” UBS’ investment bank “by cutting its footprint and achieved a profound culture change within the bank which allowed it to regain the trust of clients and other stakeholders, while restoring people’s pride in working for UBS,” the lender said in its statement.

Kelleher and Hamers both highlighted the cultural differences with Credit Suisse. UBS’ smaller rival has been plagued by scandals and compliance failures in recent years that wiped out its profit and cost several top managers their jobs.

In a fresh blow to Credit Suisse’s reputation, a US Senate investigation published Wednesday found that the bank is complicit in ongoing tax evasion by ultra-wealthy Americans.

“We do not want to import a bad culture into UBS,” Kelleher told reporters, adding that UBS would put all Credit Suisse employees “through a culture filter, to make sure we don’t import something into our ecosystem that causes culture issues.”

‘Call of duty’

Hamers said integrating the banks is something he would have “loved to do,” but that he supported the board’s decision, which was in the best interests of the new entity and its stakeholders — including Switzerland and its financial sector.

The merger is high-stakes for Switzerland’s economy, too. The combined bank’s assets are worth twice as much as the country’s annual output, while local deposits in the new entity equal 45% of GDP — an enormous amount even for a nation with healthy public finances and low levels of debt.

In the Wednesday statement, Kelleher said the deal “imposes new priorities on us,” while supporting UBS’ existing strategy.

He added: “With his unique experience, I am very confident that Sergio [Ermotti] will deliver the successful integration that is so essential for both banks’ clients, employees and investors, and for Switzerland.”

Ermotti told reporters he felt a “call of duty” to accept the role and that during his previous stint as CEO he had believed that an acquisition of this kind was the “right next move for UBS.”

“I always felt that the next chapter I wanted to write back then was a chapter of doing a transaction like this one.”

Ermotti is currently chairman of Swiss Re (SSREF) and intends to step down after the insurer’s annual general meeting next month.","['Michelle Toh Hanna Ziady', 'Michelle Toh', 'Hanna Ziady']",2023-03-29 00:00:00

GENEVA -- UBS said Wednesday that it's bringing back former CEO Sergio Ermotti to lead the Swiss bank as it executes a government-orchestrated plan to take over struggling rival Credit Suisse.

Ermotti, who was the bank's top executive for nine years and led a turnaround following the 2008 global financial crisis, will take over next Wednesday from CEO Ralph Hamers.

Hamers took up the job in November 2020 and will remain at UBS during a transition period “to ensure a successful closure of the transaction and a smooth handover,” the bank said in a statement.

“Whilst Ralph was capable of doing the job, we felt that Sergio was better suited to navigating these things,” Chairman Colm Kelleher said on a conference call, alluding to the UBS board decision. “I cannot reemphasize how big this deal is in terms of financial history and financial engineering that’s required.”

UBS credited Ermotti, who is now chairman of insurer Swiss Re, for having “cut its footprint” and changing the culture of the bank — and it pointed to his experience in bringing big financial institutions together.

Ermotti, who hails from the southern, mostly Italian-speaking Swiss region of Ticino, acknowledged that “coming back to manage this situation is a challenge” but felt “a sense of call-of-duty aspect” to return.

Plus, he said he had contemplated a tie-up like the one with Credit Suisse while previously in the top job, and it would be a bit of a ”contradiction"" for him not to accept the post ""to basically execute on what I believe was the right next move for UBS.”

Kelleher said he called Ermotti “to explore the possibility of this” a day after the emergency takeover deal was settled on March 19, which involved Swiss regulators, the federal government and top executives at both banks.

“This is is the biggest single financial transaction since 2008. That brings significant execution risk,” Kelleher said.

The hastily arranged, $3.25 billion deal for Credit Suisse aimed to stem the upheaval in the global financial system after the collapse of two U.S. banks and jitters about long-running troubles at Credit Suisse led shares of Switzerland’s second-largest bank to tank and customers to pull out their money.

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after the central bank’s plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and customers. The Swiss executive branch passed emergency measures to bypass shareholder approval.

Uncertainties still lie ahead, including a U.S. Senate committee report released Wednesday that says Credit Suisse violated a plea agreement with U.S. authorities by failing to report secret offshore accounts that wealthy Americans used to avoid paying taxes.

UBS said it assessed outstanding lawsuits and investigations as part of the Credit Suisse acquisition and expects the deal to be beneficial for shareholders. It says it's working to close the sale and get approval from regulators in the coming weeks or months.

Hamers, the outgoing CEO, said UBS executives want to ensure “a digestible transaction” in terms of risk. He said there were plans to “manage down the investment bank” at Credit Suisse because many of the activities were not central for UBS.

UBS leaders announced no immediate plan about job cuts linked to the deal.

Swiss lawmakers and academics have raised concerns that the deal could create an unwieldy Swiss banking behemoth, while UBS executives said regulatory issues loom internationally before the deal can close.

Ermotti suggested he didn't view “too big too fail” concerns as a problem.

“I do think that scale and size is not a problem if it is focused and well-managed,” he said. “For me, the debate nowadays is not ‘too big to fail' but ‘too small to survive’ — and we want to be a winner.”

Many Credit Suisse customers have expressed regret at the looming disappearance of a 167-year-old bank that has been a pillar of Switzerland's renowned banking and financial industry.

GENEVA: The UBS chairman voiced confidence on Wednesday that the Swiss bank will succeed in a government-engineered takeover of hobbled rival Credit Suisse, pledging the deal will reduce costs, benefit shareholders and buttress Swiss finance despite ""huge"" risks in knitting the global lenders together.

Speaking to UBS shareholders, Colm Kelleher gave an overview of the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.25 billion) takeover that he said would close in the next few months, alluding to the complexity of the first-ever merger of two ""global systemically important banks.""

Swiss government officials and regulators hastily orchestrated the deal that was announced on March 19 after Credit Suisse's stock plunged and jittery depositors quickly pulled out their money.Authorities feared that a teetering Credit Suisse could further roil global financial markets following the collapse of two US banks.

""Whilst we did not initiate these discussions, we believe that this transaction is financially attractive for UBS shareholders,"" Kelleher said at the annual shareholders meeting in the Swiss city of Basel. ""I'm convinced that we made the right choice.""

Kelleher said fully integrating the banks is expected to take three to four years and that while UBS is ""laser-focused on integrating Credit Suisse,"" there are possible pitfalls.

""There is a huge amount of risk in integrating these businesses,"" he said. ""But let me assure you, we are doing everything to execute this deal in the best possible way in order not to let it compromise our financial strength or stability.""

UBS executives did not face the same outcry that Credit Suisse shareholders unleashed a day earlier at what was likely the 167-year-old bank's last annual general meeting. On Tuesday, Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann acknowledged the anger and apologized for the failures leading up to the bank's rescue.

The Swiss attorney general's office has opened a probe into events surrounding Credit Suisse ahead of the UBS takeover, and the executive branch on Wednesday ordered tens of millions in cuts to the bonuses of top Credit Suisse executives.

Swiss regulators, meanwhile, said the takeover was ""the best option,"" offering the least risk of fanning a wider crisis and damaging Switzerland's standing as a financial center.

The merger ""minimized risk of contagion and maximized trust,"" said Urban Angehrn, chief executive of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or FINMA.

Two other solutions — a takeover by the Swiss government or putting Credit Suisse into insolvency proceedings — had serious drawbacks, he said Wednesday.

Insolvency would have left the functional parts of Credit Suisse in operation as a Swiss-only bank, but one with a ""damaged reputation"" through bankruptcy, he told reporters in the Swiss capital of Bern.

The government has come under fire from both pundits and opposition parliamentarians for facilitating the shotgun $3.3 billion takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS with over 250 billion Swiss Francs in guarantees and support.



The emergency meeting is only the third of its kind held by the Swiss parliament over the past 20 years. It will provide parliament with a chance to reject the loans given as part of the rescue package, though this is largely a symbolic vote as the state has already committed the funds.



The main point of contention for lawmakers was that the huge financial commitment was made by a sub-group of six MPs – leaving almost 250 without a say on the matter.



Lawmakers will also discuss whether conditions can be imposed on Credit Suisse, with the country’s Federal Council already telling the bank to either cut or reduce bonus payments to upper levels of management.



The mounting anger in Switzerland over how the government has handled this situation is reflected by a study from political research firm gfs.bern which found that a majority of the population do not support the deal.

Before the UBS acquisition of Credit Suisse, JPMorgan analysts wrote that “we see too much concentration risk and market share control.”

Swiss authorities engineered the merger in hopes of preventing a wider banking crisis.

Fears of contagion were stoked by the collapse of US-based lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank of New York.

JPMorgan Chase and 10 of the largest lenders in the country banded together to provide a $30 billion infusion of capital to help troubled San Francisco-based First Republic Bank.

https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/03/22/ubs-acquisition-credit-suisse-pay-off-shareholders/,Will UBS' Acquisition of Credit Suisse Pay Off for Shareholders?,"In a deal heavily pushed by Swiss and global banking regulators, the large Swiss bank UBS (UBS 1.29%) recently announced that it will acquire the embattled Credit Suisse (CS 1.05%) in an all-stock transaction valued at roughly $3.24 billion.

Credit Suisse has struggled immensely for the last several years and had hoped to transform itself. But given more struggles last week, significant turbulence in the banking sector, and a threat to Switzerland's economy (and perhaps Europe's as well if the bank went under), global banking regulators pushed a deal through over the weekend.

The credit rating agency S&P Global cut UBS' outlook to ""negative"" upon the announcement of the deal, citing ""material execution risk in integrating CS into UBS."" Will this deal be problematic or pay off for shareholders? Let's take a look.

Downside risk protection

The big problem that has surrounded Credit Suisse for years is the firm's investment bank, which clearly has struggled to implement proper risk management protocols. Credit Suisse has racked up billions in losses after certain businesses in the investment bank had outsize exposure to funds like Greensill Capital and Archegos Capital, which both collapsed.

Prior to UBS' acquisition, Credit Suisse had planned to break up its investment bank into three different pieces, one of which was meant to shelter riskier assets. So the biggest risk UBS faces is winding down Credit Suisse's trading business. This deal was obviously pushed through very quickly, given the potential risk of Credit Suisse collapsing, so UBS clearly hasn't had the time to do proper due diligence and there could be other unsavory surprises lurking.

The good news is that UBS secured significant downside protection from Swiss banking regulators of close to $27 billion, which will be used to cover charges, purchase price adjustments, and restructuring costs. Notably -- and quite controversially, I might add -- about $17 billion of this amount will be used to write off additional Tier 1 bank debt, which bondholders were not pleased with given they are supposed to get paid before owners of common stock. Swiss regulators will also provide roughly $9.7 billion of protection against losses in Credit Suisse's investment bank beyond the first $5.4 billion of losses, which UBS will cover.

Enhancing the UBS franchise

Aside from the downside protection, UBS is also acquiring some very good businesses from Credit Suisse, which will help the bank add scale and improve its existing operations.

Credit Suisse's asset and wealth management division has $1 trillion in client assets and brings UBS' total client assets to $5 trillion, putting the latter well on its way toward its $6 trillion goal laid out at its investor day a year ago. UBS will become the second-largest player in global wealth management and the No. 3 ranked asset manager in Europe. These businesses, which are very attractive these days due to the fact that they are less capital intensive, thrive off of scale, and shareholders tend to reward them with higher valuations, too.

UBS will also get Credit Suisse's domestic banking unit, making it the No. 1 corporate and personal bank in Switzerland, with the largest amount of deposits and loans. Bank of America analyst Alastair Ryan wrote in a research note that the pro forma institution will control a roughly 30% market share of Swiss domestic deposits. In 2022, Credit Suisse's Swiss bank reported an 11.8% return on capital, while the asset and wealth management businesses are also capable of putting up strong returns, especially with the enhanced scale at UBS.

The potential to be a great deal

Because the deal was orchestrated so quickly, there is of course execution risk and the possibility that UBS runs into obstacles as it winds down Credit Suisse's investment bank.

But UBS got a great deal. Last week, Credit Suisse was valued at about $8 billion while trading at all-time lows. UBS scooped the bank up for $3.24 billion while securing significant downside protection. The deal also increases UBS' tangible book value per share by a whopping 74%. Bank stocks trade relative to their tangible book value per share, so increasing it tends to be beneficial in the long term.

In the process, UBS is also making some nice additions to several of its businesses, as well as removing a competitor, and now has an undeniable leading position in Switzerland's banking market. Ultimately, I think the deal has the potential to be beneficial to UBS shareholders over the long-term.",['Bram Berkowitz'],2023-03-22 00:00:00

https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/ubs-salvages-most-value-credit-suisse-wreck-2023-03-19/,UBS salvages most value from Credit Suisse wreck,"













NEW YORK, March 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - UBS (UBSG.S) Chair Colm Kelleher is buying Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) because he has to, not because he wants to. The 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.2 billion) rescue deal, brokered by Swiss authorities and announced late on Sunday, is designed to shore up confidence in the country’s financial industry rather than benefit the buyer. Even so, UBS is salvaging the most value from the wreckage.

The Swiss government, central bank and regulator FINMA concluded that a UBS takeover was better than letting Credit Suisse fail, which could have sparked a wider banking-sector panic. The job for Kelleher was how to avoid infecting UBS with its arch-rival’s problems.

He’s secured some handy protections. The all-share offer values Credit Suisse at 60% less than its closing share price on Friday, and at a fraction of its 45 billion Swiss franc book value at the end of last year. FINMA will also let UBS write off its target’s debt instruments, known as Additional Tier 1 (AT1) securities, boosting the combined group’s equity capital by about 16 billion Swiss francs. Meanwhile the government will cover up to 9 billion Swiss francs of losses, such as markdowns on Credit Suisse assets, past a certain threshold.

Thanks to a competition waiver, Kelleher can even keep Credit Suisse’s domestic unit, giving UBS a dominant position in local retail and corporate banking and allowing it to extract hefty cost savings. Chief Executive Ralph Hamers reckons the bank can cut about $8 billion of annual expenses by 2027. After deducting tax at 24% and capitalising using a 10% discount rate, those savings have a net present value of about $60 billion - roughly in line with UBS’s market value before the deal.

Yet it’s a sign of Credit Suisse’s predicament that the deal is far from a home run. On a call with analysts late on Sunday, UBS executives stumbled over some of the numbers – perhaps unsurprising for a transaction negotiated over a weekend. Wealthy customers who have money stashed with both banks could move some of it to spread their risk, while UBS might have to ditch some of Credit Suisse’s dicier clients. Hamers and his team will have to rapidly shrink their new acquisition’s investment banking arm, a tricky task even in less jittery markets.

Longer term, Swiss authorities have concentrated more of the country’s financial risk in a bigger juggernaut. That means even more regulatory and political scrutiny. FINMA’s decision to write off Credit Suisse’s AT1 securities just four days after it declared the bank was meeting all its capital and liquidity requirements will only increase the alarm felt by investors in other European lenders.

A UBS takeover is preferable to the Swiss government nationalising Credit Suisse or winding it down. And Kelleher has improved the chances of the rewards outweighing the risks. Whether it’s enough to soothe the wider financial sector is less clear.

CONTEXT NEWS

UBS will rescue Credit Suisse in a deal worth about 3 billion Swiss francs, Swiss authorities and the two banks said on March 19.

Shareholders in Credit Suisse will get one new UBS share for every 22.48 shares they currently hold. Based on UBS’s closing price on March 17 the offer values Credit Suisse shares at 0.76 Swiss francs each, well below the last closing price of 1.86 Swiss francs.

Credit Suisse’s 16 billion Swiss francs of Additional Tier 1 securities will be written off to zero, boosting the combined group’s regulatory capital.

The Swiss government will also grant UBS a 9 billion Swiss franc guarantee against losses arising from certain assets that it will get as part of the deal. The guarantee kicks in if losses exceed a threshold, which the finance ministry did not quantify.

The Swiss National Bank will offer up to 100 billion Swiss francs of liquidity support to UBS and Credit Suisse, plus a further 100 billion Swiss francs to the smaller bank backed by a federal guarantee.

UBS estimates that the combined group could reduce its annual costs by roughly $8 billion.

GENEVA (AP) — Banking giant UBS is buying troubled rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion, in a deal orchestrated by regulators in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in the global banking system.

Swiss authorities pushed for UBS to take over its smaller rival after a plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and the bank’s customers. Shares of Credit Suisse and other banks plunged last week after the failure of two banks in the U.S. sparked concerns about other potentially shaky institutions in the global financial system.

Credit Suisse is among the 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

The deal was “one of great breadth for the stability of international finance,” said Swiss President Alain Berset as he announced it Sunday night. “An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.”

Switzerland’s executive branch, a seven-member governing body that includes Berset, passed an emergency ordinance allowing the merger to go through without shareholder approval.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann called the sale “a clear turning point.”

“It is a historic, sad and very challenging day for Credit Suisse, for Switzerland and for the global financial markets,” Lehmann said, adding that the focus is now on the future and in particular on the 50,000 Credit Suisse employees, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland.

Following news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated financial moves to stabilize banks in the coming week. This includes daily access to a lending facility for banks looking to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice which was widely used during the 2008 financial crisis.

“Today is one of the most significant days in European banking since 2008, with far-reaching repercussions for the industry,” said Max Georgiou, an analyst at Third Bridge. “These events could alter the course of not only European banking but also the wealth management industry more generally.”

Colm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed the “enormous opportunities” that emerge from the takeover, and highlighted his bank’s “conservative risk culture” — a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse’s reputation for more swashbuckling, aggressive gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said the council “regrets that the bank, which was once a model institution in Switzerland and part of our strong location, was able to get into this situation at all.”

The combination of the two biggest and best-known Swiss banks, each with storied histories dating to the mid-19th century, amounts to a thunderclap for Switzerland’s reputation as a global financial center — leaving it on the cusp of having a single national champion in banking.

The deal follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further panic. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse’s share price began plummeting this week.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde lauded the “swift action” by Swiss officials, saying they were “instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.”

She said the banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.

UBS officials said they plan to sell off parts of Credit Suisse or reduce the bank’s size in the coming months and years.

The Swiss government is providing more than 100 billion francs in aid and financial backstops to make the deal go through.

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs in Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out. The securities are a special type of bonds European bank regulators use to provide banks with a capital cushion in times of distress.

Berset said the Federal Council had already been discussing a long-troubled situation at Credit Suisse since the beginning of the year and held urgent meetings in the last four days amid spiraling concerns about its financial health that caused major swoons in its stock price and raised the specter of the 2007-08 financial crisis.

Investors and banking industry analysts were still digesting the deal, but at least one analyst was sour on the news because it could damage Switzerland’s global banking image.

“A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,” said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas LLC, in an email.

Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

The Credit Suisse parent bank is not part of European Union supervision, but it has entities in several European countries that are. Lagarde reiterated what she said last week after the central bank raised interest rates — that the European banking sector is resilient, with strong financial reserves and plenty of ready cash.

Many of Credit Suisse’s problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve.

The deal with UBS caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn’t invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.

On Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.

Its current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.

While smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.

Parker suggests investing in stocks that pay good dividends and can repeatedly raise those payments.

He made a list of high-upside stocks that have the room for sustained dividend growth through 2025.

As the economy slows and stocks react to turmoil in the banking system, investors have looked for safer and less volatile ways to put their money to work. Dividend-paying stocks have emerged as a popular choice.

Few professionals would tell investors to just buy the biggest dividend payers there are and leave it at that. It's too simplistic a tip, and it's arguably a risky one. Just because a stock pays a big dividend today doesn't mean that it always will, and it doesn't guarantee price returns either.

Many experts and strategists tell investors to look for companies with strong free cash flow and a history of dividend growth, as those companies are more likely to maintain their dividends and to raise them over time.

UBS Chief US Equity Strategist Keith Parker recommended a version of that approach in a recent note to clients.

""Dividend stocks can provide a margin of safety during uncertain times. Dividend stocks outperformed the market by 4.5% during the 2001, 2008, 2020 recessions,"" Parker wrote.

Instead of focusing on the biggest dividend payers of today, Parker look for companies that pay dividend at higher rates than the median S&P 500 company (1.7%), and where UBS' analysts think the companies will have far above-average rates of dividend increases over the next few years — with projected dividend growth rates of 5% to over 20%.

He also focused on companies with the potential for significant price appreciation. Parker thinks the following 30 companies could gain anywhere from 9% to 80% in price appreciation over the next year, all while paying substantial dividends over that time, with potentially even bigger payments to follow in the years ahead.

https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/ubs-brings-back-ermotti-ceo-credit-suisse-deal-98198739,UBS brings back Ermotti as CEO with Credit Suisse deal ahead,"UBS says it’s bringing back former CEO Sergio Ermotti to lead the Swiss bank as it moves forward with a government-orchestrated plan to take over struggling rival Credit Suisse

GENEVA -- UBS said Wednesday that it's bringing back former CEO Sergio Ermotti to lead the Swiss bank as it executes a government-orchestrated plan to take over struggling rival Credit Suisse.

Ermotti, who was the bank's top executive for nine years and led a turnaround following the 2008 global financial crisis, will take over next Wednesday from CEO Ralph Hamers.

Hamers took up the job in November 2020 and will remain at UBS during a transition period “to ensure a successful closure of the transaction and a smooth handover,” the bank said in a statement.

“Whilst Ralph was capable of doing the job, we felt that Sergio was better suited to navigating these things,” Chairman Colm Kelleher said on a conference call, alluding to the UBS board decision. “I cannot reemphasize how big this deal is in terms of financial history and financial engineering that’s required.”

UBS credited Ermotti, who is now chairman of insurer Swiss Re, for having “cut its footprint” and changing the culture of the bank — and it pointed to his experience in bringing big financial institutions together.

Ermotti, who hails from the southern, mostly Italian-speaking Swiss region of Ticino, acknowledged that “coming back to manage this situation is a challenge” but felt “a sense of call-of-duty aspect” to return.

Plus, he said he had contemplated a tie-up like the one with Credit Suisse while previously in the top job, and it would be a bit of a ”contradiction"" for him not to accept the post ""to basically execute on what I believe was the right next move for UBS.”

Kelleher said he called Ermotti “to explore the possibility of this” a day after the emergency takeover deal was settled on March 19, which involved Swiss regulators, the federal government and top executives at both banks.

“This is is the biggest single financial transaction since 2008. That brings significant execution risk,” Kelleher said.

The hastily arranged, $3.25 billion deal for Credit Suisse aimed to stem the upheaval in the global financial system after the collapse of two U.S. banks and jitters about long-running troubles at Credit Suisse led shares of Switzerland’s second-largest bank to tank and customers to pull out their money.

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after the central bank’s plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and customers. The Swiss executive branch passed emergency measures to bypass shareholder approval.

Uncertainties still lie ahead, including a U.S. Senate committee report released Wednesday that says Credit Suisse violated a plea agreement with U.S. authorities by failing to report secret offshore accounts that wealthy Americans used to avoid paying taxes.

UBS said it assessed outstanding lawsuits and investigations as part of the Credit Suisse acquisition and expects the deal to be beneficial for shareholders. It says it's working to close the sale and get approval from regulators in the coming weeks or months.

Hamers, the outgoing CEO, said UBS executives want to ensure “a digestible transaction” in terms of risk. He said there were plans to “manage down the investment bank” at Credit Suisse because many of the activities were not central for UBS.

UBS leaders announced no immediate plan about job cuts linked to the deal.

Swiss lawmakers and academics have raised concerns that the deal could create an unwieldy Swiss banking behemoth, while UBS executives said regulatory issues loom internationally before the deal can close.

Ermotti suggested he didn't view “too big too fail” concerns as a problem.

“I do think that scale and size is not a problem if it is focused and well-managed,” he said. “For me, the debate nowadays is not ‘too big to fail' but ‘too small to survive’ — and we want to be a winner.”

Many Credit Suisse customers have expressed regret at the looming disappearance of a 167-year-old bank that has been a pillar of Switzerland's renowned banking and financial industry.

It's official: UBS is acquiring Credit Suisse in a historic rescue takeover.

The deal was brokered by the Swiss national bank and sealed over the course of a dramatic weekend. Two fierce domestic rivals will become one. UBS will now decide which Credit Suisse businesses it wants to keep at the bank, and which of its rival's execs could play an important role in the new UBS.

There's still much that's uncertain, but one thing's clear from how this unfolded: UBS really didn't want to have to rescue its rival, and Credit Suisse isn't thrilled with this outcome either.

The announcements and official statements around the deal were filled with technical finance jargon around liquidity support and the like, but buried beneath the details were subtweets and sly digs.

For example, the first official word of the deal came from the Swiss National Bank, which announced: ""UBS today announced the takeover of Credit Suisse."" At the time, UBS had done no such thing.

The statement went on to detail some of the extraordinary terms of the deal, saying:

""With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation.""

Next, Credit Suisse announced: ""Credit Suisse and UBS to Merge.""

A merger! Not a rescue takeover. A merger! The statement read:

""Credit Suisse and UBS have entered into a merger agreement on Sunday following the intervention of the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, the Swiss National Bank and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA (FINMA). UBS will be the surviving entity upon closing of the merger transaction.""

The wording of ""following the intervention of"" makes clear this deal was not Credit Suisse's decision. And ""UBS will be the surviving entity"" spells out that this is a takeover and not a merger.

The statement gives further clarity to the government's role, going on to say the deal came after the Swiss authorities ""asked both companies to conclude the transaction to restore necessary confidence in the stability of the Swiss economy and banking system.""

Credit Suisse's statement finished with a word from its chairman Axel Lehmann (emphasis mine):

""Given recent extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances, the announced merger represents the best available outcome. This has been an extremely challenging time for Credit Suisse and while the team has worked tirelessly to address many significant legacy issues and execute on its new strategy, we are forced to reach a solution today that provides a durable outcome.""

At this point, UBS, the bank making the acquisition in this case, had not made a statement. Normally, the acquirer is the one leading the charge in announcing a transaction. Here, it was bringing up the rear.

When UBS did make a statement, it thoroughly undermined the Credit Suisse announcement. Headline: ""UBS to acquire Credit Suisse.""

It was Colm Kelleher, UBS chairman and a veteran of the financial crisis, who delivered the coup de grâce. He said in a statement (emphasis mine):

""This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue. We have structured a transaction which will preserve the value left in the business while limiting our downside exposure.""

Credit Suisse says it's a merger. UBS says it's an emergency rescue. Ha! The UBS statement also confirmed that the takeover discussions were initiated by Swiss authorities.

Even a potential photo op marking the occasion was ruined by an awkward moment in which Kelleher waited to shake hands with Lehmann. (The two eventually did connect, for the record.)

For UBS, acquiring Credit Suisse's businesses in wealth, asset management, and Swiss banking promises potential benefits. The future of Credit Suisse's investment banking business remains unclear however, with UBS promising to move the majority of its rival's markets positions to a non-core operation that would be managed down.

[Side note: The job of combining the wealth businesses will fall to Iqbal Khan, who runs UBS wealth management and used to work at Credit Suisse. In 2019, after UBS announced Khan's hire, the chief operating officer at Credit Suisse ordered a colleague to spy on him. Awkward!]

Later, on a call with analysts, Kelleher and UBS CEO Ralph Hamers defended the deal while simultaneously making it clear they themselves didn't want to do, as my colleague Rebecca Ungarino reported.

https://nypost.com/2023/03/20/credit-suisse-bondholders-blast-insane-ubs-takeover/,Credit Suisse bondholders blast ‘insane’ UBS takeover: ‘Against the law’,"Investors who purchased $17 billion worth of Credit Suisse bonds were outraged after Swiss regulators approved a $3.2 billion rescue by rival UBS that left them holding the bag.

Holders of so-called “AT1,” or additional tier 1 bonds, purchased through Credit Suisse were shocked to learn that their investments were wiped out in the deal — a move that some claimed is illegal.

“In my eyes, this is against the law,” Patrik Kauffman, a fund manager at Aquila Asset Management, a firm that invests in AT1 bonds, told the Financial Times.

The “shotgun wedding” sale of the 166-year-old Credit Suisse to its historic arch-enemy is the latest shock to the global financial system — with analysts wondering whether more European banks were due to fall.

Shares of UBS rebounded in European markets on Monday afternoon, reversing an earlier slide. UBS stock was up some 2% in Zurich while Credit Suisse shares cratered by some 60%.

As a result of the deal, UBS has seen its total assets balloon to a whopping $5 trillion.

The lender will also benefit from a special government waiver allowing it to keep Credit Suisse’s profitable unit that was purchased at a discount.

UBS also managed to secure billions of dollars worth of guarantees from the Swiss government aimed at covering losses.

AT1 bonds, which are also known as “contingent convertibles,” are bonds that were created after the 2008 financial crisis.

These debt instruments, which count toward banks’ regulatory capital, are considered riskier.

While they typically provide a higher yield than most other bonds, they can also be either converted into equity or written down entirely if a lender goes under.

Kauffman described the writedown as “insane,” telling FT: “We’ve never seen this before. I don’t think this would be allowed to happen again.”

The takeover by UBS, which was pushed by Swiss authorities who were looking to shore up confidence in the shaky global banking system in the wake of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank of New York, also resulted in a loss for Credit Suisse shareholders.

Equity holders of Credit Suisse will receive 0.76 Swiss francs — or 82 cents — per share — which is well below the bank’s closing price of around $2 per share.

But the AT1 bloodbath had bondholders seeing red.

“Everyone knows that when you’re buying AT1 bonds, you’re taking risk and you’re there to absorb losses,” Jérôme Legras of Axiom Alternative Investments told FT.

“But show me the losses — there’s still 45 billion Swiss francs ($48.62 billion) of equity in the bank,” he said.

“Shareholders got 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion) and AT1 holders got nothing, which is a reversal of the usual hierarchy.”

The $17 billion wipeout is the largest loss in the $275 billion AT1 debt market to date.

Bid prices on AT1 bonds from banks including Deutsche Bank, HSBC, UBS and BNP Paribas dropped 9 to 12 points on Monday, sending yields sharply higher, data from Tradeweb showed.

At Credit Suisse itself, dollar AT1 bonds were bid as low as 1 cent on the dollar, Tradeweb pricing showed, as investors braced for the wipeout.

UBS said it will pay $3.2 billion for the 167-year-old flagship while the government said UBS would also take on the first $5.4 billion in losses from unwinding derivatives and other risky assets.

‘’Credit Suisse was on life support and Swiss authorities believed only a full transplant of the banks divisions into UBS would restore stability to the banking system,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets, Hargreaves Lansdown.

Swiss authorities began urging UBS to purchase Credit Suisse after the investment bank’s loan failed to reassure investors and customers.

The deal involves risk for UBS.

""It will not only have to accept the healthier parts of the business but its failing ones as well – particularly its investment division, which has been mired in crisis after crisis.

Regulators faced a sense of urgency to push the deal through on Sunday before markets opened Monday as the specter of Credit Suisse potentially failing next week loomed over the negotiations. Credit Suisse, which has been in business for 167 years, is one of 30 globally systemically important banks, which heightened worries about how global financial markets would react to its implosion.

Talk about the UBS acquisition heated up over the weekend and involved the Swiss government's financial regulators giving it the green light after the sides came to an agreement over the more complex terms of the deal.

The deal involves a large amount of public support, with three tranches of liquidity and loans, as well as a pledge from the Swiss government to absorb up to 9 billion francs in potential losses from the takeover.

The total of 259 billion francs of support is equivalent to a third of Switzerland's entire economic output, which stood at 771 billion francs last year.

""The government's going to have to say to voters why they are putting citizens' money, taxpayer money at risk to bail out a bank that was predominantly servicing the ultra wealthy, doing some pretty extraordinary things with its investment bank and paying people crazy amounts of money relative to what the man in the street gets paid,"" one former global bank CEO, who did not wish to be identified, told Reuters.

Both banks have access to existing lending facilities and may obtain an additional loan of up to 100 billion francs (or about $108 billion), while Credit Suisse can also tap a second liquidity assistance loan of that size that's backstopped by the Swiss federal government.

""The substantial provision of liquidity will ensure that both banks have access to the necessary liquidity,"" the Swiss National Bank announced in a release. ""By providing substantial liquidity assistance, the SNB is fulfilling its mandate to contribute to the stability of the financial system, and it continues to work closely with the federal government and FINMA to this end.""

As a large global financial institution, Credit Suisse has an investment banking arm that it has tried to spin off in recent years, in addition to a local retail bank. UBS' acquisition of those divisions of Credit Suisse, in whole or in part, could create additional regulatory complexity for the firm given its own activities in those areas.

Layoffs are likely as Credit Suisse had previously pledged to cut 9,000 jobs as part of its restructuring, and the bank has investment and local banking divisions that overlap with UBS' operations.

However, in a memo seen by Reuters that was sent to staff on Sunday after the deal announcement, Credit Suisse reassured staff that their bonuses would be paid in full.

CREDIT SUISSE SHARES HIT RECORD LOW

Bloomberg reported that Credit Suisse balked at UBS’ initial offer of $1 billion and argued that it fell well short of the firm’s valuation, which stood at about $9.5 billion as of Friday, and that it would harm the bank’s employees and shareholders. The size of UBS’ offer was first reported by the Financial Times.

CREDIT SUISSE SHEDS NEARLY 25%, KEY BACKER SAYS NO MORE MONEY

UBS has a balance sheet of about $1.1 trillion – roughly twice the size of Credit Suisse – and has been more resilient than Credit Suisse in the years since the global financial crisis of 2008.

Credit Suisse’s distressed financial position arose from billions of dollars in losses from investments gone awry and fines imposed by regulators. Its assets dropped from $1.2 trillion in the third quarter of 2008 to $576 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022.

https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/boomerang-ubs-boss-ticks-several-important-boxes-2023-03-29/,Boomerang UBS boss ticks several important boxes,"













LONDON, March 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - UBS (UBSG.S) could not depend on a relatively inexperienced chief executive as it embarks on the biggest banking merger of the decade. That’s the best explanation for why Chair Colm Kelleher on Wednesday said the Swiss bank was replacing CEO Ralph Hamers with erstwhile boss Sergio Ermotti. Though the move violates several corporate-governance red lines, it improves the group’s chances of successfully absorbing stricken rival Credit Suisse (CSGN.S).

Bringing back the CEO who ran UBS for nine years until his departure in late 2020 is an indictment of the bank’s executive ranks and highlights the scarcity of battle-tested talent in European banking. The Swiss national, who hails from the southern canton of Ticino, did not develop a plausible heir during his tenure at UBS, prompting the board to take a punt on ING (INGA.AS) boss Hamers. One risk for shareholders is that Ermotti again struggles with succession planning, or clashes with Kelleher, whose role he previously coveted.

Still, there are plenty of examples of successful boomerang CEOs, including Steve Jobs at Apple (AAPL.O) and Bob Iger at Walt Disney (DIS.N). UBS has a near-precedent in Oswald Grübel, who parachuted in to run the Swiss bank after its near-death experience in the 2008 financial crisis, having relatively recently been in charge of Credit Suisse.

Hamers’ position looked shaky even before the Credit Suisse deal. UBS cancelled his $1.4 billion takeover of financial-technology group Wealthfront while his penchant for buzzwords, as evidenced by the corporate tagline “reimagining the power of investing”, was hardly reassuring. Nor was his hesitant delivery in a call with analysts after announcing the Credit Suisse deal.

Ermotti ticks several important boxes. First, he has successfully slashed his way through an investment bank before. UBS’s October 2012 strategy, dubbed a “strategic acceleration from a position of strength”, saw Ermotti pledge to axe $90 billion of risk-weighted assets in the investment bank, or 57% of the total, mostly in fixed-income trading. By the following summer, the bank had clawed its way back up to a valuation that exceeded its tangible book value, a sign that investors believed it could earn a respectable return on equity.

UBS shareholders will hope he can repeat the exercise with Credit Suisse, which comes with a bloated and recently unprofitable trading and dealmaking division. Ermotti has long pushed for bank consolidation. During his previous spell in charge, UBS held talks with Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and discussed a merger with Credit Suisse.

Finally, there’s his passport. Putting a Swiss national in charge could help defuse anger with the Credit Suisse rescue, which involved the government waiving competition rules and shareholder rights, and is likely to lead to thousands of job losses in Switzerland. A majority of the alpine nation’s citizens say they disagree with the deal, according to polling reported by Swissinfo. Bringing back Ermotti is far from ideal, but it reduces the risks of UBS being dragged down by its mega-merger.

Show Caption Hide Caption Swiss bank UBS takes over ailing Credit Suisse Banking giant UBS is buying its smaller rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion, in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in global banking. AP

Banking giant UBS is buying its smaller rival Credit Suisse for $3.2 billion in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in global banking, Swiss President Alain Berset announced on Sunday night.

Berset called the announcement ""one of great breadth for the stability of international finance. An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.""

The Swiss Federal Council, a seven-member governing body that includes Berset, said in a press release Sunday that it was providing a guarantee of liquidity from the Swiss National Bank to Credit Suisse.

""The Federal Council is taking this measure in order to protect financial stability and the Swiss economy,"" it the council// said.

The Swiss government said it would provide more than $9 billion ""in order to reduce any risks for UBS"" and ""potential losses arising from certain assets that UBS takes over as part of the transaction.""

Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world's globally systemic important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

SVB: Close to 190 banks could face Silicon Valley Bank's fate, according to a new study

'Wake-up call': Advocacy groups, lawmakers highlight law they say led to SVB collapse

Sunday's news conference follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further bank panics. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse's share price began plummeting this week.

Berset said the council had agreed to guarantee a total of 150 billion francs ($162 billion) of liquidity to Credit Suisse, well beyond the 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) figure that had been announced publicly. But that didn’t appear to be enough.

“We noted that the outflows of liquidity and the volatility of the markets demonstrated that necessary confidence could no longer be restored, and a rapid solution guaranteeing stability was essential.”

Still, many of Credit Suisse's problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.

The deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn't invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.

On Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.

Its current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified ""material weaknesses"" in the bank's internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.

While smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.

Despite the banking turmoil, the European Central Bank on Thursday approved a large, half-percentage point increase in interest rates to try to curb stubbornly high inflation, saying Europe's banking sector is ""resilient,"" with strong finances.

ECB President Christine Lagarde said the banks ""are in a completely different position from 2008"" during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.

The Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

UBS has posted two consecutive years of record profits and returns to shareholders under Hamers, but Kelleher said the acquisition of Credit Suisse ""created a new reality"" and ""imposes new priorities"" on the board.

In a press conference, UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher lauded Hamers' tenure, highlighting the company's ""unprecedented success despite a challenging environment"" under the Dutchman's tutelage, and his instrumental role in delivering the Credit Suisse deal.

UBS announced on Wednesday that the former CEO would replace Ralph Hamers from April 5, as the Swiss bank undertakes the mammoth task of integrating fallen rival Credit Suisse into its business.

Incoming UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti on Wednesday said his return to the helm was ""a call of duty,"" as the Swiss veteran takes on the task of restoring order to the country's battered financial reputation .

""In particular, he built financial strength and improved resilience by putting the firm's leading global wealth management business and Swiss universal bank at its core,"" Kelleher said of Ermotti's tenure as CEO from November 2011 to October 2020.

""Sergio swiftly transformed the investment bank by cutting its footprint, and achieved a profound culture change within the bank which allowed it to regain the trust of clients and other stakeholders while restoring people's pride in working for UBS.""

He added that this, combined with Ermotti's ""deep understanding of the financial service industry in Switzerland and globally,"" made the Swiss banking veteran the man for the job.

Credit Suisse's emergency sale to UBS followed years of losses and scandals, and Swiss authorities and regulators' hasty brokerage of the deal over the course of a weekend dealt a blow to the country's reputation for financial stability.

Kelleher emphasized that Ermotti's task — the successful integration of Credit Suisse into UBS — was ""essential for both banks' clients, people and investors, for Switzerland and for the global financial system in general.""

Ermotti's first stint as CEO began amid the fallout from a $2.3 billion loss inflicted on the bank by a rogue trader in London. He inherited an ailing investment bank that had been forced to write off more than $50 billion during the great financial crisis, along with being implicated in what would become a costly Libor investigation.

After a campaign of sweeping job cuts, an exit from substantial portions of the fixed income trading division, the investment bank was focused and streamlined, and Ermotti's radical course of action was welcomed by investors.

'Call of duty'

Ermotti leaves his post as chairman of Swiss Re, one of the world's largest reinsurance companies, in order to take the reins at the new combined Swiss banking behemoth.

Asked by CNBC during Wednesday's press conference about his motivation for returning to UBS, Ermotti said there was ""a call of duty aspect"" to his decision.

""And also, frankly speaking, I always thought that despite all these discussions and the size of the bank, I always felt that the next chapter I wanted to write back then was a chapter of doing a transaction like this one.""

He also confirmed that he will be in the role for ""as long as they want me,"" and emphasized that bank wants to ""take away uncertainty as soon as we can"" regarding its restructuring and prospective layoff plans.

""I'm fully aware that we need to work very hard here to avoid any consequence for the taxpayers in Switzerland. You have my word and my commitment that together with my team, we will work and do everything that it takes to make this transaction successfully, and to write another very important and successful chapter in UBS' history,"" Ermotti told Wednesday's press conference.",['Elliot Smith'],2023-03-29 00:00:00

Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS, is reportedly approaching a deal to take over its troubled rival Credit Suisse, a move that could ease growing concerns that the turbulence at the European banking behemoth could ripple through the global economy. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Boards at Switzerland’s two biggest banks have been meeting this weekend and are nearing a merger agreement that could be cinched as early as Sunday, according to the Wall Street Journal. Regulators have proposed allowing the banks to forgo shareholder votes to speed up the deal, the Journal reported.

The discussions are the latest development in more than a week of tumult and fears about the resilience of the global financial system after the shocking collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and subsequent actions on Wall Street and by regulators to shore up major financial institutions.

The banks’ key regulators in the United States, Britain and Switzerland also are considering the legal structure of a deal, as UBS seeks concessions, including some form of government agreement to cover future legal costs, according to the Financial Times. Credit Suisse’s shares jumped 7 percent in after-hours trading.

Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment. The Swiss National Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Germany’s Deutsche Bank also is watching to see if it could acquire certain Credit Suisse businesses, according to a Bloomberg News report.

A takeover could limit fears that the turmoil at Credit Suisse and multiple troubled financial institutions in the United States would create a banking contagion, similar to the events of the 2008 financial crisis. Even after actions by governments and financial institutions this week, the stock market has showed continued worry that the banking industry’s tumult has not settled. Yet experts say that the financial system appears to be on firm ground and that the volatility in the stock market may reflect news developments rather than a signal of a broader crisis.

The discussions follow a week of chaos for Credit Suisse. On Thursday, Switzerland’s central bank provided the company a $53.7 billion liquidity lifeline, after the bank disclosed “material weaknesses” in its financial reporting.

But Credit Suisse’s underlying troubles began well before the recent trouble at banks in the United States. The 167-year-old bank, which originally served the ultrawealthy, has had financial losses, risk and compliance problems and a critical data breach. Credit Suisse in October disclosed that it suffered significant customer withdrawals, and in 2021, it experienced major losses because of its exposure to the collapse of New York-based Archegos Capital Management.

The moves in Europe follow an announcement Thursday that 11 of the biggest banks in the United States would deposit $30 billion into First Republic Bank. The move was aimed at shoring up the bank and sending a signal about the broader security of the U.S. financial system. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley Bank’s parent company on Friday filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Credit Suisse, the troubled Swiss-based investment bank, received an offer from its intracountry rival Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) to purchase it for around $1 billion, according to the Financial Times. Swiss regulators spearheaded the deal to help restore trust and calm in a highly volatile global banking environment over the last few weeks.

The Wall Street Journal reported talks are still ongoing, and the deal may be subject to change. In the wake of the sudden closures of United States-based Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, along with concerns over the financial strength of the balance sheets of hundreds of small and regional banks, UBS and Swiss regulators need to plan for several exogenous factors that could impact the acquisition. One concern is how much money the Swiss authorities will allocate for guarantees or backstops if the worldwide banking situation worsens.

Both banks offer similar services. UBS and Credit Suisse provide investment banking, high-net-worth wealth management, asset management, stock and bond sales and trading. UBS has more than 74,000 employees working from nearly 50 countries. Credit Suisse is also global and the second largest Swiss bank with around 50,480 employees.

Prepare For Large Layoffs

It is likely that once the two similar institutions combine, significant layoffs will be announced. Since the two banks offer similar products and services, considerable redundancies will exist.

Recruiting on Wall Street for more than 25 years, I’ve seen this trend play out on many occasions. The firm initiating the takeover will drive the process and lean toward saving their employees—to the detriment of those who work for the acquired company.

Since there’s overlap in nearly all the divisions, intense competition between talented people at each organization will occur to keep their jobs. Leadership will likely let go of thousands of workers to save money, cut costs and streamline the new entity during a challenging economy.

Wall Street has already caught the layoff contagion. Top-tier New York City-based investment bank Goldman Sachs let go of around 4,000 white-collar professionals, impacting around 8% of the bank’s global workforce. Goldman laid off 500 employees in September as the economy faltered.

Morgan Stanley, a top competitor of Goldman, let go of around 1,600 people. Credit Suisse previously announced before the SVB implosion that it would ax around 5,000 jobs.

Wells Fargo laid off hundreds of people in its mortgage division because of high interest rates hurting the real estate market. U.K.-based investment bank Barclays, with a strong presence in the U.S., is exiting about 200 employees in its banking and trading units. Citigroup laid off about 50 traders.

Tens of thousands of people may be out of work due to the closures of SVB, Signature Bank, Silvergate Bank and other banking and financial companies with problematic balance sheets, forcing them to slash costs, including downsizing bankers and other personnel.

Why This Is Happening

Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old bank, is one of the world's largest money management firms, ranked among the top 30 global systemically important banks. If the bank fails, it could cause a significant contagion, similar to how the U.S. was concerned about the fall of SVB, which is much smaller than Credit Suisse.

The drama is playing out somewhat like during the great financial crisis. The federal government pushed JPMorgan to absorb the collapsing Bear Stearns investment bank, and Bank of America took on the once-venerable Merrill Lynch. Similarly, UBS was reportedly under the gun of Swiss authorities to acquire its competitor to avoid fueling the fire on an unstable global financial market.

History Repeats Itself

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon bailed out Bear Stearns at the behest of the U.S. government. Dimon said in a letter to shareholders a few years ago about whether or not he’d do this again, “No, we would not do something like Bear Stearns again. In fact, I don’t think our Board would let me take the call.”

At that time, CNBC reported that JPMorgan needed to fund $6 billion for severance packages, ongoing litigation, asset write-downs and an array of expenses. Dimon was cajoled to also picking up Washington Mutual, which saddled JPMorgan with toxic mortgages and legal responsibility for at least $19 billion in fines and settlements with multiple regulators in 2013.

UBS Is Concerned Over Regulatory Baggage And Backstoping Losses

Credit Suisse brings regulatory baggage. The bank had dealings with the now-bankrupt Greensill Capital and connections to the alleged scandal involving Bill Hwang's Archegos Capital Management hedge fund, creating a loss of $5 billion, representing about a year's worth of profit.

Credit Suisse now confronts the unpleasant matter of its shareholders being wiped out. Like other banks, the financial institution faced sudden withdrawals of funds. Venture capitalists called for the U.S. government to backstop any losses emanating from SVB’s shutdown, feverishly trying to get their money out of the bank, causing concern and some panic. Similarly, social-media-induced comments spooked Credit Suisse’s wealthy clients to take their funds elsewhere.

Given all the uncertainty, UBS seeks concessions and protections from the government. In addition to bank safety matters, UBS wants to be protected from pending regulatory investigations and legal issues, which could result in hefty fines.","['Jack Kelly', 'Amy Danise', 'Senior Contributor']",2023-03-19 00:00:00

Despite a string of multiple bad calls and scandals over the last five years, Credit Suisse was among the top 30 banks to be considered ‘Global Systemically Important Banks’. In the previous eight days, the bank’s stock had lost 75% of its value and was eventually subject to a takeover bid by rival UBS in a deal supported by the Swiss government.

In this light, what does the Credit Suisse ‘bailout’ tell us about the current state of banking?

Credit Suisse to Become UBS

On Sunday, Credit Suisse issued a press release on the merger with UBS bank. According to the Financial Stability Board (FSB) that emerged from the ashes of the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, UBS is also designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).

Both Credit Suisse and UBS are headquartered in Switzerland as multinational investment banks. The merger between Credit Suisse with UBS will leave UBS as the surviving entity once the deal is finalized by the end of 2023 under these conditions:

Credit Suisse shareholders are to receive 1 UBS share for 22.48 Credit Suisse shares.

Switzerland’s central bank, the Swiss National Bank, will provide extra liquidity access to Credit Suisse during the restructuring.

Personnel from Credit Suisse will continue employment as UBS appoints new leadership and integrates the bank’s operations under UBS.

The merger took motion once UBS upped its offer to buy Credit Suisse for $3.25 billion, following the $1 billion offer rejection by the Credit Suisse board. On Friday, Credit Suisse’s closing price was CHF 1.86. Therefore, even with UBS upping its offer from 0.25 to 0.50 per share in its stock, the CS buyout was heavily discounted.

Accordingly, CS shareholders will take a significant loss as they receive CHF 0.76 in UBS shares for CS stock worth CHF 1.86 just a few days ago. Axel P. Lehmann, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse, framed the UBS-Credit Suisse merger as the best outcome:

“Given recent extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances, the announced merger represents the best available outcome.”

Indeed, Credit Suisse’s merger with UBS was underpinned by multiple unprecedented events. The ending of the 167-year-old bank was hastily arranged over the weekend, which does not bode well for consumer confidence.

Extraordinary Bailout of Credit Suisse

Also on Sunday, the Swiss National Bank issued a press release on its CHF 100 billion ($108B) to facilitate UBS’ takeover of Credit Suisse. The central bank clarified that “both banks have unrestricted access to the SNB’s existing facilities.”

A federal default guarantee backs the CHF 100 billion liquidity assistance loan. If the borrower fails to repay its obligations, the SNB commits to selling government bonds and other debt securities.

This is the first such intervention since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008.

Typically, such federal default guarantees are implicitly assumed to boost consumer confidence in the banking system. The problem is that the SNB reported an annual 2022 loss of CHF 132.5 billion ($143B). This is the deepest loss in the central bank’s 116-year history, almost all coming from foreign currency positions, at CHF 131.5 billion.

Such loss is somewhat surprising given that the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) warns explicitly that “There are many activities of banks which involve risk-taking, but there are few in which a bank may so quickly incur large losses as in foreign exchange transactions.”

Compared to a year prior, in 2021, the SNB profited from foreign currency positions at CHF 25.7 billion.

In addition to SNB’s shaky financial legs, while simultaneously providing up to CHF 100 billion as a loan for the UBS-Credit Suisse merger, law-tweaking was also needed. Under normal circumstances, UBS shareholders had to vote on the merger, which had been circumvented before Monday.

“I have never seen such measures taken; it shows how bad the situation is.” Vincent Kaufmann, CEO of Ethos Foundation, representing Swiss pension funds.

The abrupt law change by the Swiss government makes the UBS-Credit Suisse merger one of a kind.

The Credit Suisse Collapse Rife with Omens

Last November, Credit Suisse estimated a $1.6 billion loss in Q4 following a sustained $88.3 billion bank run. In 2022, the bank suffered CHF 160 billion ($173 billion) deposit exodus, with CHF 111 billion just for Q4.

It was no coincidence that CS’s deposit withdrawals have ramped up since 2020. Early that year, CS CEO Tidjane Thiam had to resign after a spying scandal came into the public spotlight. It turned out that the bank hired private investigators to spy on CS’s former wealth management head, Iqbal Kahn, following his departure to competitive UBS.

The spy scandal resulted in the suicide of one of the private investigators.

After Thomas Gottstein took the CS reins in February 2020, he lasted until July 2022. The following month, CS was found guilty of money laundering assets belonging to the Bulgarian mafia from the decade prior. Although the fine was tiny, at $2.1 million, CS became the first major Swiss bank involved in such criminal proceedings.

However, the lack of due diligence by CS was far more damaging. In April 2021, the bank found itself in a $4.7 billion bind following the machinations of “Bill Hwang’s” Archegos Capital. Altogether, Credit Suisse managed to fashion public perception as the bank riddled with cultural rot.

https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1144954/why-the-ubs-takeover-of-credit-suisse-is-bad-for-bondholders,Why the UBS Takeover of Credit Suisse Is Bad for Bondholders,"UBS UBS has agreed to buy rival Credit Suisse CS for CHF 3.0 billion (USD 3.2 billion) as Swiss authorities sought to restore confidence in the financial system. This slashed the value of Credit Suisse’s shares, but it’s really the owners of the bank’s low-ranking bonds who are left holding the bag.

Under the terms of the transaction, Credit Suisse shareholders will receive one UBS share for every 22.48 shares of common stock. Based on Friday’s closing prices, the transaction values Credit Suisse shares at CHF 0.76, which is 59% below its last closing price of CHF 1.86.

The last-minute rescue failed to calm nerves early Monday, and bank stocks were under massive pressure throughout the morning.

‘A Real Dent to Market Confidence’

According to Credit Suisse’s news release, “Credit Suisse and UBS have entered into a merger agreement on Sunday following the intervention of the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, the Swiss National Bank, and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority. UBS will be the surviving entity upon closing of the merger transaction.”

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann called the merger “the best available outcome,” while UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher called it an “emergency rescue.” In a separate statement, UBS announced its intention “to acquire Credit Suisse,” opting not to share Credit Suisse’s use of the term “merger.” Combining the two banks will create an asset-management giant with more than $5.0 trillion in assets under management, including more than $3.4 trillion in wealth management. The corporate and investment banking activities, a long-term source of trouble for the Swiss bank, seem destined to disappear or be heavily restructured.

“The UBS takeover in principle is good news, an expedited outcome, rather than wait and watch to see if Credit Suisse could actually manage the necessary restructuring,” commented Michael Field, Morningstar’s Europe market strategist. “The problem for investors generally, however, is that a takeover like this really does hark back to 2008 and forced takeovers of Merrill Lynch and so on. Also, the speed at which Credit Suisse went downhill is worrying, and ultimately a real dent to market confidence.”

Seniority Is Thrown to the Wind

In a surprise move, the Swiss regulator ordered “a complete write-down” of the value of Credit Suisse’s CHF 16 billion in additional Tier 1 bonds, which are also known as contingent convertible bonds. This means that holders of these bonds will be left with nothing. Stock owners, who normally have lower priority than bond owners in a bankruptcy process, will still receive about 40% of the most recent share price under the deal.

Additional Tier 1 bonds are the lowest rung of bank debt. They are risky instruments that yield high returns when things run smoothly, but they are also designed to first feel the pain when a bank gets into trouble.

Their wipeout was perceived as a blow for European debt markets.

“What Finma [the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority] has done breaking capital structure will have a long-term consequence for any Swiss financial debt,” one holder of Credit Suisse additional Tier 1 bonds told in the Financial Times. A banker told the paper that the decision could lead to a “nightmare” in European debt markets, given that bondholders had heavier losses forced on them than shareholders.

Shortly after the deal was announced, the central banks of the euro area, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, and the United States announced that they would increase the frequency of dollar swap transactions from weekly to daily. This is to ensure the supply of liquidity to banks.

A Terrible Week

The crisis-ridden Swiss bank had come under intense pressure last week, triggered by the collapse of three U.S. regional banks—Silicon Valley Bank SIVB, Signature Bank SBNY, and Silvergate Bank SI. On Tuesday, Credit Suisse was able to publish its annual report with a delay, where it became clear that it continued to see liquidity outflows, following CHF 123.2 billion in outflows in 2022. According media reports, Credit Suisse was losing deposits at a CHF 10 billion per day run rate.

The bank’s terminal nosedive was triggered on Wednesday, when its main shareholder, the Saudi National Bank, said it would not provide further financial support. Credit Suisse stock tumbled by more than 30% and fell below CHF 2.00 for the first time.

Later that day, the Swiss National Bank offered to provide liquidity to the group, if needed. Credit Suisse accepted the offer just a few hours later, borrowing CHF 50 billion. The intervention failed to stop the bleeding, and Credit Suisse shares ended the week down 25%.

On Friday evening, the Financial Times reported that UBS was in negotiations about a full or partial takeover of its competitor. It became clear over the weekend that regulators and politicians thought the situation of Switzerland’s second-largest bank was no longer tenable. The deal was made public late on Sunday.

UBS Could Benefit From Takeover

According to Morningstar banking analyst Johann Scholtz, UBS will benefit from the takeover in the long run. “UBS is in a much better position to execute a radical restructuring of Credit Suisse’s business than Credit Suisse was,” he said. “We calculate that UBS’ 2027 cost savings target would reduce Credit Suisse’s 2022 adjusted operating expenses by around 60%. The restructuring will come with material costs, but UBS is better placed than Credit Suisse to absorb this. The challenge for UBS will be to keep revenue attrition to a minimum during the restructuring period.”

UBS shares staged a remarkable rally Monday afternoon, reversing steep losses after the bank's 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.2 billion) ""emergency rescue"" of embattled domestic rival Credit Suisse .

Shares of UBS closed 1.2% higher, recovering from losses of over 14% at one point in the session. Credit Suisse, meanwhile, closed more than 55% lower.

Europe's banking index rose 1.2% by the end of the session, recouping earlier losses as a sense of calm appeared to return to markets.

The volatility comes shortly after UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse as part of a cut-price deal in an effort to stem the risk of contagion to the global banking system.

Swiss authorities and regulators helped to facilitate the deal, announced Sunday, as Credit Suisse teetered on the brink.

The size of Credit Suisse was a concern for the banking system, as was its global footprint given its multiple international subsidiaries. The 167-year-old bank's balance sheet is around twice the size of Lehman Brothers' when it collapsed, at about 530 billion Swiss francs at the end of last year.

The combined bank will be a massive lender, with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets and ""sustainable value opportunities,"" UBS said in a release late Sunday.

The bank's chairman, Colm Kelleher, said the acquisition was ""attractive"" for UBS shareholders but clarified that ""as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue.""

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/19/business/credit-suisse-ubs-rescue/index.html,UBS is buying Credit Suisse in bid to halt banking crisis,"London CNN —

Switzerland’s biggest bank, UBS, has agreed to buy its ailing rival Credit Suisse in an emergency rescue deal aimed at stemming financial market panic unleashed by the failure of two American banks earlier this month.

“UBS today announced the takeover of Credit Suisse,” the Swiss National Bank said in a statement Sunday. It said the rescue would “secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy.”

UBS is paying 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion) for Credit Suisse, about 60% less than the bank was worth when markets closed on Friday. Credit Suisse shareholders will be largely wiped out, receiving the equivalent of just 0.76 Swiss francs in UBS shares for stock that was worth 1.86 Swiss francs on Friday. Owners of $17 billion worth of “additional tier one” bonds — a riskier class of bank debt — will lose everything, Swiss regulators said.

Extraordinarily, the deal will not need the approval of shareholders after the Swiss government agreed to change the law to remove any uncertainty about the deal.

Credit Suisse (CS) had been losing the trust of investors and customers for years. In 2022, it recorded its worst loss since the global financial crisis. But confidence collapsed last week after it acknowledged “material weakness” in its bookkeeping and as the demise of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank spread fear about weaker institutions at a time when soaring interest rates have undermined the value of some financial assets.

Shares in the 167-year-old bank fell 25% over the week, money poured from investment funds it manages and at one point account holders were withdrawing deposits of more than $10 billion per day, the Financial Times reported. An emergency loan of nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank failed to stop the bleeding.

But it did “build a bridge” to the weekend, to allow the rescue to be pieced together, Swiss officials said Sunday night.

“This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue,” UBS chairman Colm Kelleher told reporters.

“It is absolutely essential to the financial structure of Switzerland and … to global finance,” he told reporters.

Desperate to prevent the meltdown spreading through the global financial system on Monday, Swiss authorities initiated the search for a private sector solution, with limited state support, while reportedly considering Plan B — a full or partial nationalization.

“Given recent extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances, the announced merger represents the best available outcome,” Credit Suisse chairman Axel Lehmann said in a statement.

“This has been an extremely challenging time for Credit Suisse and while the team has worked tirelessly to address many significant legacy issues and execute on its new strategy, we are forced to reach a solution today that provides a durable outcome.”

The emergency takeover was agreed to after a days of frantic negotiations involving financial regulators in Switzerland, the United States and United Kingdom. UBS (UBS) and Credit Suisse rank among the 30 most important banks in the global financial system, and together they have almost $1.7 trillion in assets.

Regulators applaud the takeover

Financial market regulators around the world cheered UBS’ action to take over Credit Suisse.

US authorities said they supported the action and worked closely with the Swiss central bank to assist the takeover.

“We welcome the announcements by the Swiss authorities today to support financial stability,” said US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a joint statement. “The capital and liquidity positions of the US. banking system are strong, and the US financial system is resilient.”

Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, said the banking sector remains resilient but the ECB stands at the ready to help banks maintain enough cash on hand to fund their operations if the need arises.

“I welcome the swift action and the decisions taken by the Swiss authorities,” Lagarde said. “They are instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.

The Bank of England said it welcomed the measures taken by the Swiss authorities “to support financial stability.”

“We have been engaging closely with international counterparts throughout the preparations for today’s announcements and will continue to support their implementation,” it said in a statement. “The UK banking system is well capitalized and funded, and remains safe and sound.”

How UBS and Credit Suisse will fit together

The global headquarters of UBS and Credit Suisse are just 300 yards apart in Zurich but the banks’ fortunes have been on very different paths recently. Shares of UBS have climbed 15% in the past two years, and it booked a profit of $7.6 billion in 2022. It had a stock market value of about $65 billion on Friday, according to Refinitiv.

Credit Suisse shares have lost 84% of their value over the same period, and last year it posted a loss of $7.9 billion. It was worth just $8 billion at the end of last week.

Dating back to 1856, Credit Suisse has its roots in the Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (SKA), which was set up to finance the expansion of the railroad network and industrialization of Switzerland.

In addition to being Switzerland’s second biggest bank, it looks after the wealth of many of the world’s richest people and offers global investment banking services. It had more than 50,000 employees at the end of 2022, 17,000 of those in Switzerland.

The Swiss National Bank said it would provide a loan of 100 billion Swiss francs ($108 billion) to UBS and Credit Suisse to boost liquidity.

UBS Chief Executive Ralph Hamers will be CEO of the combined bank, and Kelleher will serve as chairman.

The takeover will reinforce the position of UBS as the world’s leading wealth manager with $5 trillion of invested assets, and boost its ambition to grow in the Americas and Asia. UBS said it expects to generate cost savings of $8 billion per year by 2027. Credit Suisse’s investment bank is in the crosshairs.

“Let me be clear. UBS intends to downsize Credit Suisse’s investment banking business and align it with our conservative risk culture,” Kelleher said.",['Mark Thompson'],2023-03-19 00:00:00

GENEVA -- Banking giant UBS is buying troubled rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion, in a deal orchestrated by regulators in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in the global banking system.

Swiss authorities pushed for UBS to take over its smaller rival after a plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and the bank’s customers. Shares of Credit Suisse and other banks plunged this week after the failure of two banks in the U.S. sparked concerns about other potentially shaky institutions in the global financial system.

Credit Suisse is among the 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

The deal was “one of great breadth for the stability of international finance,"" said Swiss President Alain Berset as he announced it Sunday night. ""An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.”

Switzerland's executive branch, a seven-member governing body that includes Berset, passed an emergency ordinance allowing the merger to go through without shareholder approval.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann called the sale “a clear turning point.”

“It is a historic, sad and very challenging day for Credit Suisse, for Switzerland and for the global financial markets,” Lehmann said, adding that the focus is now on the future and in particular on the 50,000 Credit Suisse employees, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland.

Following news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated financial moves to stabilize banks in the coming week. This includes daily access to a lending facility for banks looking to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice which widely used during the 2008 financial crisis. Three months after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September of 2008, such swap lines had been tapped for $580 billion. Added swap lines were also rolled out during market turmoil in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in March of 2020.

“Today is one of the most significant days in European banking since 2008, with far-reaching repercussions for the industry,"" said Max Georgiou, an analyst at Third Bridge. “These events could alter the course of not only European banking but also the wealth management industry more generally.”

Colm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed the “enormous opportunities” that emerge from the takeover, and highlighted his bank’s “conservative risk culture” — a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse's reputation for more swashbuckling, aggressive gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said the council ""regrets that the bank, which was once a model institution in Switzerland and part of our strong location, was able to get into this situation at all.”

The combination of the two biggest and best-known Swiss banks, each with storied histories dating to the mid-19th century, amounts to a thunderclap for Switzerland’s reputation as a global financial center — leaving it on the cusp of having a single national champion in banking.

The deal follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further panic. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse’s share price began plummeting this week.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde lauded the “swift action” by Swiss officials, saying they were “instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.”

She said the banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.

UBS officials said they plan to sell off parts of Credit Suisse or reduce the bank's size in the coming months and years.

The Swiss government is providing more than 100 billion francs in aid and financial backstops to make the deal go through.

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out. European bank regulators use a special type of bond designed to provide a capital cushion to banks in times of distress. But these bonds are designed to be wiped out if a bank’s capital falls below a certain level, which was triggered as part of this government-brokered deal.

Berset said the Federal Council had already been discussing a long-troubled situation at Credit Suisse since the beginning of the year and held urgent meetings in the last four days amid spiraling concerns about its financial health that caused major swoons in its stock price and raised the specter of the 2007-08 financial crisis.

Investors and banking industry analysts were still digesting the deal, but at least one analyst was sour on the news because it could damage Switzerland’s global banking image.

“A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,” said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas LLC, in an email.

Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

The Credit Suisse parent bank is not part of European Union supervision, but it has entities in several European countries that are. Lagarde reiterated what she said last week after the central bank raised interest rates — that the European banking sector is resilient, with strong financial reserves and plenty of ready cash.

Many of Credit Suisse’s problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.

The deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn't invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.

On Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.

Its current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.

While smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.

The Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

https://www.financial-planning.com/news/ubs-touts-advisor-recruiting-website-as-it-buys-credit-suisse,UBS's recruiting website dances with forced Credit Suisse marriage and field leadership cuts,"UBS, in the midst of a blockbuster $3.3 billion takeover of rival Credit Suisse, has long sought to hire the world's most lucrative wealth managers. Part of that goal revolves around a digital tool launched last fall that's being deployed as the merger of the two Swiss giants raises questions about potential job cuts and higher expenses.

UBS quietly debuted a website called Financial Advisor Experience , or FA(x), last September to offer prospective recruits answers to common questions about joining the global bank. The company hasn't formally announced the site or pushed out marketing campaigns around it.

Wealth advisors at competitors who visit the website can click around three primary areas, ""Join,"" ""Grow"" and ""Retire."" The tabs reflect the UBS's strategy of appealing to advisors by advertising some of its compensation structuring, culture, expectations and benefits upfront. But the site doesn't spill the full or final beans: Ultimately, any advisor who joins the bank has a transition deal custom structured for that advisor or team, David Larado, UBS' head of advisor recruiting and retention, said in an interview.

The website ""addresses the transparency topic of the recruits' journey, that we believe no other firm really offers at this stage,"" he said.

Pressured by Swiss regulators worried about global financial contagion on the heels of three U.S. bank collapses this month, UBS reluctantly agreed March 19 to buy its Swiss peer . Credit Suisse had said before the arranged marriage that it was already in the process of cutting 9,000 jobs to lower costs.

The two banks are global titans of wealth management for the ultrarich and powerful, with banking traditions whose origins began in the Middle Ages. But the forced merger may exert cost pressures on UBS's recruiting ambitions in the U.S. as many jobs and roles in the two banks overlap and UBS will inherit baggage from Credit Suisse, though some $17 billion of the latter's riskiest bonds will be written off.

Digital tools over human recruiters?

Asked if UBS planned to accelerate its development of FA(x), a bank spokesperson said in an email that the Credit Suisse absorption would not result in changes to the strategy. The website is being deployed as UBS rolls back its ranks of ""field leaders,"" professionals who oversee branches and who serve as human recruiters.

UBS's recruiting slowed in the last quarter of 2022 . Still, the wirehouse plans to use the site to pick up more advisors in the ultrahigh net worth and high net worth segments.

Through word of mouth, and via UBS field leaders who act as recruiters by posting content from the site on LinkedIn and emailing prospective recruits, the portal has already seen more traffic in each of the past few months since its launch, Larado said. The website is open to the general public.

""We're seeing tens of thousands of visits,"" he said. ""And a majority of the visits are from natural search. So it's not even derived from a direct URL type-in or something along those lines.""

The site quotes an anonymous recruit from JPMorgan Chase who joined UBS in 2021, long before the website emerged, claiming that their experience had been more ""transparent"" compared to that at Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch. The website of Wells Fargo Advisors has a financial advisor Careers page, though it's not clear how long it's been there. Merrill has a couple of pages on its website about general and experienced advisor recruiting, as well as a few informational recruiting pages , including one for certain early career advisors , on parent company Bank of America's site — although the firm did not say how long those pages had been up.

Rival large broker-dealer Edward Jones has a similar website focused on recruits, though it's not specific to only advisors and also includes job opportunities such as internships.

There was no prior advisor recruiting webpage on the UBS website before FA(x), a person familiar with the matter said in an email, meaning UBS's effort might be catching up or just keeping with peers in that respect.

Larado said that experts had contributed content on ""strategic segments,"" information about chief investment office functions, analytics, sustainability, and using technology to grow a book of business.

Chat live

Within two months or so UBS will roll out a new feature, ""FA Live,"" where advisors can request to speak to an advisor at UBS who was recently recruited, Larado said.

He said he was only looking for certain advisors: those who ""run businesses that are rooted in advisory, that are focused on ultrahigh net worth and high net worth clients, and that embrace banking and lending.""

Work on the website began years ago, before UBS field leadership ranks, or ""market leaders,"" were were on track to be slashed in half last November, from roughly 40 to 20, according to an internal memo cited by AdvisorHub . With the layoffs that typically accompany a mega-merger, a bank's field leaders are among the most at risk. That could potentially make UBS's new website a digital replacement for human recruiting tools.

""Those field leadership positions are always vulnerable, because they're non-revenue producing positions,"" said Jason Diamond, a vice president and senior consultant at industry recruiting firm Diamond Consultants.

Wells Fargo announced similar cuts of market leader roles last month .

Whether FA(x) will make a difference for UBS is uncertain. ""The reality is, especially for larger more sophisticated teams, they were going to find ways to get all that information anyway, whether it was through curated one-on-one sessions or VIP days, or just working directly with the managers to ask those questions,"" Diamond said.

""It's a nice way to free up capacity for some of the folks at UBS,"" he added, but ""the heavy lifting on the due diligence probably doesn't change all that much as a result.""",['Bloomberg News'],2023-03-20 19:25:36.894000

If you squint a little, Tuesday looks like a ""normal"" trading day — almost. That is to say, U.S. markets yesterday were concerned with inflation and interest rate fears, not a banking crisis.

Of course, the major news of the day still revolved around banks. Earlier today, UBS reappointed Ermotti to the position of Group CEO, citing Ermotti's successful repositioning of the bank after the 2008 financial crisis, which allowed UBS to ""regain the trust of clients and other stakeholders."" This suggests UBS is prioritizing stability as it proceeds with its merger with Credit Suisse.

Across the Atlantic, on Tuesday, the Senate grilled U.S. regulators on SVB's collapse. Banks slipped after regulators said they were in favor of tighter rules for banks. But the movement — the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF dropped 0.09% — was marginal, compared with the drastic swings of the past two weeks.

While we don't know the effects of UBS' CEO swap yet, in the U.S., interest rates, arguably, had a greater effect than the Senate hearing on market moves. U.S. Treasury yields climbed again — the 2-year yield hit 4.08%, breaching the 4% threshold for the first time in almost a week, and the 10-year yield rose to 3.571%. The rise in yields suggests traders are growing confident the banking turmoil is subsiding, and they're turning their attention back to inflation.

Indeed, the expectations index from the Conference Board showed consumers think inflation will remain at 6.3% over the next 12 months, and their short-term outlook is at a level consistent with an imminent recession. (Though it has to be acknowledged that consumer outlook brightened slightly from February, even after SVB's collapse.)

As a result, the rate-sensitive Nasdaq Composite fell a second day, losing 0.45%. It might seem like a small decline, but Solus Alternative Asset Management's Dan Greenhaus warned ""only the top quintile [of the Nasdaq] is up; all four of the other quintiles are down,"" which indicates the index is ""a little weaker than the headline suggests."" Other major indexes didn't fare better. The S&P 500 sank 0.16% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.12%.

""For the time being, investors seem to be looking beyond the challenges in the financial sector and recognizing that U.S. economic growth continues to be resilient,"" said Brian Levitt, global market strategist for Invesco. In a bizarre way, even if that's bad news for inflation, that's probably good news for everyone who's been consumed by banking fears in recent days.

The combination is expected to create a business with more than USD 5 trillion in total invested assets and sustainable value opportunities. It will further strengthen UBS’s position as the leading Swiss-based global wealth manager with more than USD 3.4 trillion in invested assets on a combined basis, operating in the most attractive growth markets.

The transaction reinforces UBS’s position as the leading universal bank in Switzerland. The combined businesses will be a leading asset manager in Europe, with invested assets of more than USD 1.5 trillion.

UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said: “This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue. We have structured a transaction which will preserve the value left in the business while limiting our downside exposure. Acquiring Credit Suisse’s capabilities in wealth, asset management and Swiss universal banking will augment UBS’s strategy of growing its capital-light businesses. The transaction will bring benefits to clients and create long-term sustainable value for our investors.”

UBS Chief Executive Officer Ralph Hamers said: “Bringing UBS and Credit Suisse together will build on UBS’s strengths and further enhance our ability to serve our clients globally and deepen our best-in-class capabilities. The combination supports our growth ambitions in the Americas and Asia while adding scale to our business in Europe, and we look forward to welcoming our new clients and colleagues across the world in the coming weeks.”

The discussions were initiated jointly by the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, FINMA and the Swiss National Bank and the acquisition has their full support.

Under the terms of the all-share transaction, Credit Suisse shareholders will receive 1 UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares held, equivalent to CHF 0.76/share for a total consideration of CHF 3 billion. UBS benefits from CHF 25 billion of downside protection from the transaction to support marks, purchase price adjustments and restructuring costs, and additional 50% downside protection on non-core assets. Both banks have unrestricted access to the Swiss National Bank existing facilities, through which they can obtain liquidity from the SNB in accordance with the guidelines on monetary policy instruments.

The combination of the two businesses is expected to generate annual run-rate of cost reductions of more than USD 8 billion by 2027.

UBS Investment Bank will reinforce its global competitive position with institutional, corporate and wealth management clients through the acceleration of strategic goals in Global Banking while managing down the rest of Credit Suisse’s Investment Bank. The combined investment banking businesses accounts for approximately 25% of Group risk weighted assets.

UBS anticipates that the transaction is EPS accretive by 2027 and the bank remains capitalized well above its target of 13%.

Colm Kelleher will be Chairman and Ralph Hamers will be Group CEO of the combined entity.

The transaction is not subject to shareholder approval. UBS has obtained pre-agreement from FINMA, Swiss National Bank, Swiss Federal Department of Finance and other core regulators on the timely approval of the transaction.

UBS Group AG and UBS AG",[],2023-03-19 00:00:00
https://www.businessinsider.com/ubs-acquisition-credit-suisse-swiss-banking-wealth-management-2023-3,Swiss Miss: Why UBS's deal with Credit Suisse will threaten its hold on rich clients,"UBS was already a giant in wealth management before it agreed to buy doomed rival Credit Suisse.

Ultra-rich clients are concerned that the acquisition will impact the bank's white-glove service.

Whether clients stay or go depends on how quickly UBS can cure Credit Suisse's woes.

UBS was already the largest private wealth manager in the world before it agreed to buy fellow Swiss bank Credit Suisse. A forced merger will now broaden UBS's already sprawling client base, but it will also invite challenges for its wealth brand across the globe.

UBS and Credit Suisse are both known for servicing the ultra-rich, though UBS does so on a much larger scale. The acquirer had $2.8 trillion in global wealth management assets as of the end of 2022 while Credit Suisse's totalled $585 billion.

Rich clients as well as industry analysts are concerned that UBS will have to spend considerable time and resources to integrate Credit Suisse, which has been plagued by scandals for several years. For instance, Credit Suisse's then-CEO Tidjane Thiam was ousted in 2019 after it was discovered the bank had hired spies to trail star banker Iqbal Khan after he departed for UBS. Khan now leads UBS's global wealth business and could be responsible for integrating the two.

Rich families, who tend to spread their money with banks across the globe, are ""concerned at what UBS might find and the drain it might take on UBS,"" said Wendy Craft, who runs the family office of New York real-estate heir Kent Swig. ""If you need to bank in Switzerland, you may have to, but short of that, folks are in a wait-and-see mode.""

Michael Oliver, cofounder of Global Partnership Family Offices, has gotten numerous inquiries from members of the UK-based family office association about the acquisition. Most are worried about the interruption of the white-glove service they have come to expect from UBS. Credit Suisse's baggage doesn't help UBS's brand either.

""Credit Suisse's reputation is worse than UBS in the family office ecosystem. Does that degrade UBS by their combination? Yes,"" said Oliver.

But he added that this is only one factor in clients' decision-making process when it comes to choosing a wealth manager.

What will determine how many clients stay or go is how quickly UBS can integrate the best parts of Credit Suisse and cut the rest. If the takeover distracts UBS management from its core business of wealth management, this well-heeled crowd has plenty of options outside Switzerland.

One plus one doesn't equal two when it comes to client assets

In the US, little is expected to change when it comes to wealth management as Credit Suisse sold off its domestic wealth business to Wells Fargo in 2015. (Investment banking is another story). Insider spoke to two private wealth advisors based in North America who said they weren't worried and clients have not expressed concerns.

But the impact will be felt overseas. With mass layoffs expected at Credit Suisse, customers may choose to follow their advisors and bankers rather than stay with the newly merged institution, said Max Georgiou, a London-based analyst at Third Bridge.

""Our experts say that with thousands of redundancies on the way, it is highly likely that some of the Credit Suisse management team will use their extensive contacts to start up their own wealth managers,"" Georgiou told Insider. ""These start-ups and the increased competition they will bring could peel away some clients from the newly merged bank.""

Furthermore, this clientele prefers to bank with multiple institutions, he added. As Switzerland only had two banking giants, many clients already had accounts with both. With this merger, they may move some assets to other private banks to reduce exposure. Mid-sized private banks such as Lombard, Julius Baer, and Pictet, may be big beneficiaries from this migration, he said.

According to a Reuters report, Credit Suisse's employees in wealth management in Zurich were reassured at a town hall on Monday that the combined units would act like a ""big family"" and that UBS is weighing financial sweeteners to reassure staff. UBS did not immediately respond to a request to comment on its plans.

Repairing and integrating Credit Suisse might be a distraction

Firdaus Ibrahim, Kuala Lumpur-based senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Insider that the acquisition confers several advantages to UBS, such as more opportunities for cross-selling and a greater foothold in Southeast Asia. That said, while UBS is better placed to fix Credit Suisse's issues, it is still a monumental task.

""There is no quick and easy solution to this. UBS needs to dispose and restructure underperforming business units, put in the right people, and improve risk and control measures throughout the CS business so that past mishaps and scandals do not occur again,"" said Ibrahim. ""All of this requires significant time and effort from the management team.""

Swiss banks, despite their shadowy reputation, are no longer as secretive as they used to be, and have shared account data with foreign tax authorities since 2018.

""The proposition has evolved. It has been as much about discretion as it has been about secrecy for decades now,"" said Oliver. ""There is still an expectation of excellence with Swiss banking: high levels of client service is key.""

The expenses associated with the Credit Suisse acquisition might hamstring UBS when it comes to growth in the US. New York-based recruiter Louis Diamond said these costs may stop the bank's aggressive recruitment efforts.

""Are they going to have enough profits to keep investing in the business because they really need to keep pace with Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo, which are investing heavily in the wealth management business?"" he said. ""That's the big question.""

But the merger gives UBS and Credit Suisse clients the thing that matters most

But the acquisition wasn't just about rescuing Credit Suisse but restoring confidence in the Swiss banking system, Ibrahim noted. The lifeline provided by the Swiss government indicates that the new bank is too big to fail.

""This should strengthen the appeal of Swiss banking industry, in my view, as clients and investors can be assured that their interest is being looked after by the regulators,"" he said.

In the short term, clients are most concerned about deposit safety and asset protection, according to Oliver, despite concerns about future service.

For one Irish billionaire and Credit Suisse client, this is what matters most.

""I don't think there is going to be much change. This is what we have been told so far,"" he said on the condition of anonymity. ""Our relationship person will probably change but that is it. Deposits are safe and that is really what people care about.""",['Hayley Cuccinello'],2023-03-22 00:00:00
https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/19/ubs-offers-to-buy-credit-suisse-for-up-to-1-billion-the-financial-times-reports.html,"UBS offers to buy Credit Suisse for 'substantially' more than $1 billion, sources say","Swiss banking giant UBS on Sunday has entered talks to buy its embattled rival Credit Suisse for ""substantially"" more than 1 billion Swiss francs, sources told CNBC's David Faber.

The Financial Times reported that UBS has agreed to buy the bank for more than $2 billion, marking a substantial increase from the initial $1 billion offer the FT reported earlier Sunday. Faber said the price of the deal increased throughout the day's negotiations.

The Swiss government is holding a news conference to address the deal at 2:30 p.m. ET. Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment on the reports when contacted by CNBC.

Credit Suisse reportedly balked at UBS' initial offer, arguing it was too low and would hurt shareholders and employees, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg.

Swiss authorities have also reportedly been considering full or partial nationalization of the bank as an alternative to the UBS takeover, according to a Sunday Bloomberg report.

The UBS deal is being orchestrated quickly, so the Swiss are preparing for the case that it falls through, Bloomberg said, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The country is reportedly considering whether it would take over the bank completely or hold a significant equity stake.

The UBS offer comes after Credit Suisse shares logged their worst weekly decline since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, despite an announcement that it would access a loan of up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the Swiss central bank.

It had already been battling a string of losses and scandals, and last week sentiment was rocked again with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the shuttering of Signature Bank in the U.S., sending shares sliding.

Credit Suisse's scale and potential impact on the global economy is much greater than the U.S. banks. The Swiss bank's balance sheet is around twice the size of Lehman Brothers when it collapsed, at around 530 billion Swiss francs as of end-2022. It is also far more globally inter-connected, with multiple international subsidiaries — making an orderly management of Credit Suisse's situation even more important.

Credit Suisse lost around 38% of its deposits in the fourth quarter of 2022, and revealed in its delayed annual report early last week that outflows have still yet to reverse. It reported a full-year net loss of 7.3 billion Swiss francs for 2022 and expects a further ""substantial"" loss in 2023.

The bank had previously announced a massive strategic overhaul in a bid to address these chronic issues, with current CEO and Credit Suisse veteran Ulrich Koerner taking over in July.

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into investment process and portfolio construction. Strategies across geographies and styles approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio manager’s ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio consisting primarily of sustainable investments may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered by the portfolio manager, and the investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ. Companies may not necessarily meet high performance standards on all aspects of ESG or sustainable investing issues; there is also no guarantee that any company will meet expectations in connection with corporate responsibility, sustainability, and/or impact performance.

Alle in dieser Publikation enthaltenen Informationen und Meinungen stammen aus als zuverlässig und glaubwürdig eingestuften Quellen, trotzdem lehnen wir jede vertragliche oder stillschweigende Haftung für falsche oder unvollständige Informationen ab (ausgenommen sind Offenlegungen, die sich auf UBS beziehen). Alle Informationen und Meinungen sowie angegebenen Prognosen, Einschätzungen und Marktpreise sind nur zum Zeitpunkt der Erstellung dieser Publikation aktuell und können sich jederzeit ohne Vorankündigung ändern. Hierin geäusserte Meinungen können von den Meinungen anderer Geschäftsbereiche von UBS abweichen oder diesen widersprechen, da sie auf der Anwendung unterschiedlicher Annahmen und/oder Kriterien basieren.

Dieses Dokument oder die darin enthaltenen Informationen (einschliesslich Prognosen, Werte, Indizes oder sonstiger berechneter Beträge («Werte»)) dürfen unter keinen Umständen für folgende Zwecke verwendet werden: (i) für Bewertungs- oder buchhalterische Zwecke; (ii) zur Bestimmung der fälligen oder zahlbaren Beträge, Preise oder Werte von Finanzinstrumenten oder -verträgen; oder (iii) zur Messung der Performance von Finanzinstrumenten, einschliesslich zwecks Nachverfolgung der Rendite oder Performance eines Werts, Festlegung der Vermögensallokation des Portfolios oder Berechnung der Performance Fees. UBS und ihre Direktoren oder Mitarbeiter könnten berechtigt sein, jederzeit Long- oder Short-Positionen in hierin erwähnten Anlageinstrumenten zu halten, in ihrer Eigenschaft als Auftraggeber oder Mandatsträger Transaktionen mit relevanten Anlageinstrumenten auszuführen oder für den Emittenten beziehungsweise eine mit diesem Emittenten wirtschaftlich oder finanziell verbundene Gesellschaft bzw. das Anlageinstrument selbst andere Dienstleistungen zu erbringen. Zudem könnten Mitglieder der Konzernleitung bei der Emittentin oder einer mit ihr verbundenen Gesellschaft als Verwaltungsräte tätig sein. Die von UBS und ihren Mitarbeitern getroffenen Anlageentscheidungen (einschliesslich der Entscheidung, Wertpapiere zu kaufen, verkaufen oder zu halten) könnten von den in den Research-Publikationen von UBS geäusserten Meinungen abweichen oder ihnen widersprechen. Bei Illiquidität des Wertpapiermarkts kann es vorkommen, dass sich gewisse Anlageprodukte nicht sofort realisieren lassen. Aus diesem Grund ist es manchmal schwierig, den Wert Ihrer Anlage und die Risiken, denen Sie ausgesetzt sind, zu quantifizieren. UBS setzt Informationsbarrieren ein, um den Informationsfluss aus einem oder mehreren Bereichen innerhalb von UBS in andere Bereiche, Einheiten, Divisionen oder verbundene Unternehmen von UBS zu steuern. Der Termin- und Optionenhandel eignet sich nicht für jeden Anleger, da ein erhebliches Verlustrisiko besteht und die Verluste den ursprünglich investierten Betrag übersteigen können. Die Wertentwicklung einer Anlage in der Vergangenheit stellt keine Gewähr für künftige Ergebnisse dar. Weitere Informationen sind auf Anfrage erhältlich. Manche Anlagen können plötzlichen und erheblichen Wertverlusten unterworfen sein. Bei einer Liquidation Ihrer Anlagewerte kann es vorkommen, dass Sie weniger zurückerhalten als Sie investiert haben, oder dass man Sie zu einer Zusatzzahlung verpflichtet. Wechselkursschwankungen können sich negativ auf den Preis, Wert oder den Ertrag einer Anlage auswirken.

Wichtige Informationen über nachhaltige Anlagestrategien: Nachhaltige Anlagestrategien versuchen, die Faktoren Umwelt, Soziales und Unternehmensführung (ESG) beim Anlageprozess und Portfolioaufbau miteinzubeziehen. So verschieden die Strategien je nach geografischer Region und Anlagestil sind, so unterschiedlich ist deren Vorgehen bezüglich ESG-Analysen und der Einbeziehung der daraus resultierenden Erkenntnisse. Wenn ein Portfoliomanager ESG-Faktoren oder Nachhaltigkeitskriterien einbezieht, kann er bestimmte Anlagechancen möglicherweise nicht nutzen, die ansonsten zu seinem Anlageziel und anderen grundsätzlichen Anlagestrategien passen würden. Die Erträge eines Portfolios, das hauptsächlich aus nachhaltigen Anlagen besteht, sind unter Umständen geringer oder höher als die eines Portfolios, bei dem der Portfoliomanager keine ESG-Faktoren, Ausschlusskriterien oder andere Nachhaltigkeitsthemen berücksichtigt. Zudem kann ein solches Portfolio Unterschiede hinsichtlich der Anlagechancen aufweisen. Unternehmen erfüllen möglicherweise nicht bei allen Aspekten für ESG oder nachhaltiges Investieren hohe Performancestandards. Es gibt auch keine Garantie, dass ein Unternehmen die Erwartungen bezüglich der Corporate Responsibility, Nachhaltigkeit und/oder Wirkung erfüllt.

Informations générales sur la recherche financière et les risques:

Cette publication vous est adressée à titre d’information uniquement et ne constitue ni ne contient aucune incitation ou offre d’achat ou de cession de quelque valeur mobilière ou instrument financier que ce soit. L'analyse figurant ici ne constitue pas une recommandation personnelle ni ne prend en compte les objectifs de placement, les stratégies de placement, la situation financière et les besoins particuliers de chaque destinataire de ladite publication. Des hypothèses différentes peuvent entraîner des résultats sensiblement différents. Elle repose sur de nombreuses hypothèses. Certains services et produits sont susceptibles de faire l’objet de restrictions juridiques et ne peuvent par conséquent pas être offerts dans tous les pays sans restriction aucune et/ou peuvent ne pas être offerts à la vente à tous les investisseurs. Bien que ce document ait été établi à partir de sources que nous estimons dignes de foi, il n’offre aucune garantie quant à l’exactitude et à l’exhaustivité des informations et appréciations qu’il contient à l’exception des informations divulguées en rapport avec UBS. Toutes les informations et opinions ainsi que les prévisions, estimations et prix du marché indiqués correspondent à la date du présent rapport et peuvent varier sans préavis. En raison de l’application d’hypothèses et de critères différents, les appréciations présentées dans ce document peuvent différer de celles formulées par d’autres départements ou divisions d’UBS ou même leur être contraires.

Dans aucune circonstance, ce document ou toute information y figurant (y compris les prévisions, valeurs, indices ou autre montant calculé («Valeurs»)) ne peut être utilisé aux fins suivantes: (i) fins d’évaluation ou de comptabilisation; (ii) pour déterminer les montants dus ou payables, le prix ou la valeur d’un instrument financier ou d’un contrat financier; ou (iii) pour mesurer la performance d’un instrument financier, notamment aux fins de suivre le rendement ou la performance d’une Valeur, définir l’allocation d’actifs d’un portefeuille ou calculer les commissions de performance. Dès lors que vous avez reçu ce document et pris connaissance des informations qu’il renferme, il sera considéré que vous certifiez à UBS que vous n’utiliserez pas ce document, ou que vous ne vous appuierez pas sur lesdites informations, quelles qu’elles soient, pour aucune des fins susmentionnées. UBS et ses administrateurs ou collaborateurs peuvent être autorisés à tenir à tout moment des positions longues ou courtes dans les instruments de placement mentionnés ici, à réaliser des transactions sur des instruments de placement à titre de teneur de marché ou d’agent, ou à fournir tout autre service ou à avoir des agents qui font office d’administrateurs, soit pour l’émetteur, soit pour l’instrument de placement lui-même, soit pour toute entreprise associée sur le plan commercial ou financier auxdits émetteurs. A tout moment, les décisions de placement (y compris l’achat, la vente ou la détention de titres) prises par UBS et ses collaborateurs peuvent différer ou être contraires aux opinions exprimées dans les publications d’UBS Research. Dans le cas de certaines transactions complexes à réaliser pour cause de manque de liquidité de la valeur, il vous sera difficile d’évaluer les enjeux et de quantifier les risques auxquels vous vous exposez. UBS s’appuie sur certains dispositifs de contrôle de l’information pour contrôler le flux des informations contenues dans un ou plusieurs départements d’UBS vers d’autres départements, unités, divisions ou sociétés affiliées d’UBS. Le négoce de futures et d’options ne convient pas à tous les investisseurs parce qu’il existe un risque important de pertes et que ces pertes peuvent être supérieures à l’investissement initial. Les performances passées ne sauraient préjuger de celles à venir. Des informations complémentaires sont disponibles sur demande. Certains placements peuvent être sujets à des dépréciations soudaines et massives et, le jour du dénouement, la somme vous revenant peut être inférieure à celle que vous avez investie ou vous pouvez être contraint d’apporter des fonds supplémentaires. Les fluctuations des taux de change peuvent avoir un impact négatif sur le prix, la valeur ou le rendement d’un instrument financier. L’analyste/Les analystes responsable(s) de la préparation du présent rapport peut/peuvent interagir avec le personnel du trading desk, le personnel de vente et autres aux fins de collecte, de synthèse et d’interprétation des informations boursières.

La fiscalité dépend des circonstances spécifiques de chacun et peut faire l’objet de modifications dans le futur. UBS ne fournit pas de conseils d’ordre juridique ou fiscal et ne fait aucune déclaration sur le régime fiscal auquel les actifs ou les rendements des placements sont soumis, de manière générale ou par rapport à la situation et aux besoins spécifiques du client. Sachant qu’il nous est impossible de tenir compte des objectifs d’investissement individuels de chacun de nos clients, ni de leur situation financière ou de leurs besoins personnels, nous recommandons aux clients désireux de réaliser une transaction sur l’une des valeurs mobilières mentionnées dans ce document de s’informer auprès de leur conseiller financier ou de leur fiscaliste sur les éventuelles conséquences de cette transaction, notamment sur le plan fiscal.

Information importante relative à la stratégie d'investissement durable: les stratégies d‘investissement durable visent à prendre en considération et à intégrer les facteurs environnementaux, sociaux et de gouvernance (ESG) dans le processus d'investissement et la construction du portefeuille. Les différentes stratégies sur le plan géographique et des styles impliquent des analyses ESG et une intégration des résultats en conséquence. L'intégration de facteurs ESG ou de considérations dictées par l'investissement durable peut entraver la capacité du gestionnaire de portefeuille de saisir certaines opportunités de placement qui seraient sinon conformes à son objectif de placement et à d'autres stratégies de placement traditionnelles. Les rendements d'un portefeuille composé essentiellement d'investissements répondant aux critères ESG ou d'investissements durables peuvent être inférieurs ou supérieurs à ceux des portefeuilles qui ne tient pas compte des facteurs ESG, de critères d‘exclusion ou d'autres questions liées à l'investissement durable. En outre, dans ces portefeuilles, les opportunités d‘investissement disponibles peuvent différer. Les entreprises peuvent ne pas nécessairement satisfaire aux normes de performance élevées pour tous les aspects ESG ou toutes les questions liées aux investissements durables; en outre, il n'existe aucune garantie que les entreprises répondent aux attentes dans le domaine de la reponsabilité d'entreprise, du développement durable et/ou de la performance en termes d'impact.

Italian: (La preghiamo di voler leggere le importanti avvertenze legali e le divulgazioni d'informazione alla fine del documento.)

Disclaimer = Informazioni sui rischi

Le opinioni d’investimento di UBS Chief Investment Office («CIO») sono elaborate e pubblicate dalla divisione Global Wealth Management di UBS Switzerland AG (disciplinata dalla FINMA in Svizzera) o da una sua affiliata («UBS»).

Le opinioni d’investimento sono state formulate in conformità delle norme di legge volte a promuovere una ricerca d’investimento indipendente.

Ricerca d’investimento generica – Informazioni sui rischi:

Questa pubblicazione viene distribuita solo afini informativi e non rappresenta un’offerta né una sollecitazione di offerta diretta per l’acquisto o la vendita di prodotti d’investimento o di altri prodotti specifici. L’analisi contenuta nella presente pubblicazione non costituisce una raccomandazione personale né tiene conto degli obiettivi d’investimento, delle strategie d’investimento, della situazione finanziaria o delle esigenze particolari di un determinato destinatario. Si basa su numerosi presupposti. Presupposti diversi potrebbero dare risultati sostanzialmente diversi. Alcuni prodotti e servizi sono soggetti a restrizioni legali e non possono essere offerti in tutto il mondo in modo incondizionato e/o potrebbero non essere idonei alla vendita a tutti gli investitori. Tutte le informazioni e le opinioni espresse in questo documento sono state ottenute da fonti ritenute attendibili e in buona fede; tuttavia, si declina qualsiasi responsabilità, contrattuale o tacita, per l’eventuale mancanza di correttezza o completezza (a eccezione della divulgazione di informazioni relative a UBS). Tutte le informazioni e le opinioni così come le previsioni, le stime e i prezzi di mercato indicati si riferiscono unicamente alla data della presente pubblicazione e sono soggetti a cambiamenti senza preavviso. Le opinioni qui espresse possono discostarsi o essere contrarie alle opinioni espresse da altri dipartimenti o divisioni di UBS a seguito dell’utilizzo di presupposti e/o criteri diversi.

Il presente documento e le informazioni ivi contenute (tra cui previsioni, valori, indici o altri importi calcolati («Valori»)) non possono in alcun caso essere utilizzati per i seguenti scopi: (i) a fini di valutazione o di contabilità; (ii) per stabilire gli importi dovuti o da versare, il prezzo o il valore di uno strumento finanziario o di un contratto finanziario; o (ii) per misurare la performance di uno strumento finanziario, anche, tra l’altro, con l’obiettivo di monitorare il rendimento o la performance di un Valore o di definire l’asset allocation di un portafoglio oppure di calcolare le commissioni di performance. Ricevendo il presente documento e le informazioni ivi contenute si ritiene che dichiariate e assicuriate a UBS che non userete questo documento e che non farete diversamente affidamento sulle informazioni ivi contenute per gli scopi di cui sopra.UBS e ogni suo dirigente o dipendente possono in ogni momento essere autorizzati a detenere posizioni lunghe o corte in strumenti d’investimento menzionati in questa pubblicazione, effettuare operazioni che coinvolgono tali strumenti d’investimento in conto proprio o in conto terzi o fornire qualsiasi altro servizio o avere funzionari che operano in qualità di dirigenti nei confronti dell’emittente, dello strumento d’investimento stesso o di una società commercialmente o finanziariamente collegata a tali emittenti. In ogni momento, le decisioni d’investimento (compresa la scelta di acquistare, vendere o detenere titoli) prese da UBS e dai suoi dipendenti possono differire o essere contrarie alle opinioni espresse nelle pubblicazioni di ricerca di UBS. Alcuni investimenti possono non essere immediatamente realizzabili, dal momento che lo specifico mercato può essere illiquido, e di conseguenza la valutazione dell’investimento e la determinazione del rischio possono essere difficili da quantificare. UBS fa affidamento su barriere all’informazione per controllare il flusso di informazioni contenute in una o più aree di UBS verso altre aree, unità, divisioni o affiliate di UBS. Le operazioni su future e opzioni non sono idonee a tutti gli investitori poiché comportano un elevato rischio di perdita e possono generare perdite superiori all’investimento iniziale. I risultati passati di un investimento non rappresentano una garanzia dei suoi rendimenti futuri. Maggiori informazioni saranno rese disponibili su richiesta. Alcuni investimenti possono essere soggetti a improvvise e consistenti perdite di valore e allo smobilizzo dell’investimento è anche possibile ricevere una somma inferiore a quella inizialmente investita o dover effettuare un versamento integrativo. Le variazioni dei corsi di cambio possono avere un effetto negativo sul prezzo, sul valore o sul rendimento di un investimento. L’analista/Gli analisti responsabile/i della preparazione di questo rapporto può/possono interagire con il personale del trading desk, il personale di vendita e altre unità allo scopo di raccogliere, sintetizzare e interpretare informazioni di mercato.

Il trattamento fiscale dipende dalla situazione personale e potrebbe subire variazioni in futuro. UBS non fornisce consulenza legale o fiscale e non rilascia alcuna dichiarazione circa il trattamento fiscale degli attivi o dei loro rendimenti d’investimento, né a titolo generale né in riferimento alla situazione e alle esigenze specifiche del cliente. Ci è impossibile tenere conto degli obiettivi d’investimento, della situazione finanziaria e delle esigenze particolari di ogni singolo cliente e pertanto vi raccomandiamo di rivolgervi a un consulente finanziario e/o fiscale per discutere le implicazioni, comprese quelle fiscali, dell’investimento in qualunque prodotto menzionato nel presente materiale.

Per ulteriori informazioni circa gli autori della presente pubblicazione e di altre pubblicazioni del CIO eventualmente citate nel presente documento e per richiedere copie di studi passati sullo stesso argomento si prega di rivolgersi al proprio consulente alla clientela.

Informazioni importanti sulle strategie basate sugli investimenti sostenibili: le strategie basate sugli investimenti sostenibili mirano a prendere in considerazione e integrare i fattori ambientali, sociali e di governance (ESG) nel processo d’investimento e nella costruzione del portafoglio. Le strategie più varie in termini di orientamento geografico e stile d’investimento possono effettuare analisi ESG e integrarne i risultati in diversi modi. L’inclusione dei fattori ESG o delle considerazioni alla base degli investimenti sostenibili può impedire al gestore di partecipare a certe opportunità d’investimento che altrimenti sarebbero in linea con il suo obiettivo d’investimento e con altre strategie d’investimento tradizionali. I rendimenti di un portafoglio composto essenzialmente da investimenti sostenibili possono essere superiori o inferiori a quelli di un portafoglio il cui gestore non tiene conto dei fattori ESG, non opera esclusioni e non considera altri aspetti della sostenibilità, e le opportunità d’investimento a disposizione di tali portafogli possono essere diverse. Le società possono non soddisfare necessariamente elevati standard di performance per tutti gli aspetti ESG o tutti i temi degli investimenti sostenibili; inoltre, non si garantisce che le società soddisfino le aspettative negli ambiti della responsabilità aziendale, della sostenibilità e/o della performance in termini d’impatto.

UBS has become depositors' most secure bet, TD Cowen's Jaret Seiberg told CNBC, after it agreed to take over Credit Suisse on Sunday.

The bank is set to acquire its Swiss counterpart in a $3.2 billion acquisition deal. The government-backed arrangement is an attempt to settle investors' anxiety, after Credit Suisse couldn't stem deposit outflows amid uncertainty about its liquidity and debt holdings.

""I think right now UBS has to be the world's safest bank,"" Seiberg said Monday, referring to its depositors. ""The Swiss authorities have told everybody that this thing is too big to fail.""

Together, UBS and Credit Suisse will share around $5 trillion in assets. US-listed shares of UBS were up nearly 4% on Monday. Meanwhile, Credit Suisse stock continued to tumble, diving by over 60% as terms of the all-stock takeover entailed a near-wipeout for shareholders.

The news also comes alongside another bank acquisition over the weekend: Signature Bank, one of the two regional lenders seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. over a week ago, had also found a buyer.

The third-largest bank failure after Silicon Valley Bank before it, Signature will now be in the hands of Flagstar Bank, which acquired all of its deposits and branches, as well as some of its loans.

The deal comes after the FDIC said it will guarantee all deposits at Signature and SVB, even those that exceed its $250,000 limit.

But Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen acknowledged to Congress on Thursday that, unlike SVB and Signature Bank, not all deposits exceeding the $250,000 limit will be guaranteed in the future.

For now, bank profits and net interest margins remain healthy, Seiberg said, and unlimited deposit backstops represent more of a ""break the glass emergency option.""

""What we really have is a crisis of confidence,"" he added. ""Unlimited deposit insurance is the final act to restore confidence, but I'm not sure it's needed today.""",['Filip De Mott'],2023-03-20 00:00:00

UBS has agreed to acquire Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion). The government-brokered deal aims to calm jittery investors and depositors, and halt the burgeoning banking crisis before it spirals out of control.

The planned mega-merger is just the latest development in a dramatic couple of weeks. Three US banks have folded, regulators have rushed to contain the fallout with emergency measures, and Warren Buffett has reportedly spoken to senior White House officials about potentially stepping in to save the day.

The Swiss agreement has major implications for US investors. They range from its impact on financial markets and the banking sector, to its potential effect on the American economy and interest rates.

Here's a closer look at what the deal could mean.

What pressures led to the deal?

Credit Suisse has faced a series of scandals in recent years, ranging from bad bets to corporate espionage. Recently, the Swiss banking giant revealed there were ""material weaknesses"" in its financial reporting.

Investors got worried it could be caught up in the turmoil driven by the US bank failures. Their reaction tanked its stock and bonds, and drove up the cost of insuring against the bank defaulting on its debt.

Swiss authorities determined the lender was at risk, and pushed UBS to acquire it. The Swiss National Bank has agreed to lend UBS the equivalent of $108 billion to help it see through the merger.

Meanwhile, Switzerland's financial regulator has wiped out $17 billion worth of Credit Suisse bonds and removed the need for UBS shareholders to approve the transaction.

What does it say about the threat to banks right now?

Swiss officials' involvement in the deal, and the substantial sweeteners they've provided to make it happen, suggest they're deeply concerned about the ongoing banking crisis.

Those growing worries are reflected in the concerted effort taken by the US Federal Reserve and other central banks at the weekend. They've come together to help foreign banks get access to US dollars by offering swap operations every day through April, rather than once a week.

The mega-takeover also has clear parallels with the banking deals sealed during and after the 2008 financial crisis. That's when JP Morgan scooped up Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, Bank of America acquired Merrill Lynch, and Wells Fargo bought Wachovia.

If more deals lead to more consolidation in the banking industry, that could reflect pressures on smaller lenders are growing, forcing them to seek safety in the arms of larger, wealthier peers.

What sparked the concerns about banks?

The current turmoil was touched off by Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and Silvergate all shutting down in the past couple of weeks.

In SVB's case, it ran into trouble because it had a high percentage of uninsured deposits. It also invested in long-dated bonds that have plunged in price over the past year, as the Fed hiked interest rates.

The bank's cash-hungry, venture-capital-backed customers rushed to pull their money out after SVB sold bonds at a loss and tried to raise fresh capital. They were worried the bank could fail, and they would lose most of their cash.

The wave of withdrawals overwhelmed the bank, spurring the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) to take control and later guarantee all of its deposits. The FDIC also took the same action at Signature, while Silvergate voluntarily closed down.

Meanwhile, the Fed established an emergency lending program to help banks easily access capital to weather any further pressures.

The banks' challenges, and authorities' efforts so far in response to them, made investors sour on global banks, paving the way for UBS to acquire Credit Suisse.

How could the Swiss deal affect markets?

Governments worldwide will be hoping the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse will calm fears about the chance of more bank failures. The Swiss government's ""whatever it takes"" approach could also help restore faith in the financial system.

But investors could interpret the rushed deal — seen as a bailout by some — as a sign of desperation in the face of a real threat to vulnerable banks.

On Monday morning, UBS shares slumped 7% and the Euro Stoxx Bank Index slid 1%. That suggest the Swiss bank's shareholders aren't impressed by the deal terms, and that the market isn't reassured about the prospects for other lenders.

What does the transaction mean for the US economy and interest rates?

The UBS-Credit Suisse deal may be a mixed blessing for Americans. It could help to cool inflation, but might also raise the odds of a recession.

US inflation spiked to a 40-year high last year, spurring the Fed to lift interest rates from nearly zero to upwards of 4.5% over the past 12 months — and it could raise them again at its meeting this week.

Rate hikes help curb price increases as they make borrowing more costly and encourage people to save instead of spend. But at the same time, they can dampen consumer demand and weigh on the prices of stocks and other assets. They can also lift the risk of a recession by pushing unemployment higher.

Americans could see the UBS-Credit Suisse deal as evidence of serious underlying problems in banks and the wider financial system.

As a result, they might become more conservative in their spending, investing, and hiring — and that might not change until they're certain more banks aren't going to fail. They need to be reassured they aren't going to lose their jobs or suffer a big blow to their retirement savings.

That could help the Fed in its inflation fight, but might pose to a risk to financial stability and employment — two other priorities for the central bank.

Fed officials could face a situation where they want to hike rates further to crush inflation, but doing so could heap further pressure on lenders and exacerbate the banking crisis, increasing the risk of a broader economic downturn.

What does this all mean for the current banking crisis?

American investors may well see the UBS-Credit Suisse deal as evidence of a mad scramble to shore up liquidity among lenders and combine different banks.

Also, they may view it as a harbinger of more bad news to come — the first in a wave of tie-ups. That's especially a risk given how things played out during the financial crisis.

That means US stockpickers and bondholders will be watching for more red flags at domestic banks. They're also likely to keep a close eye on what the authorities do next, to gauge just how serious the current challenges are.

Without an unlimited blanket guarantee on bank deposits, it's easy to imagine customers will be wary that more banks could fail. They could seek to park their funds in safer places.

The turmoil could weaken inflationary pressures by leading banks to tighten their lending, and by confidence among consumers and businesses.

But it could also mean the Fed faces a double whammy: stubborn inflation against a backdrop of fragile growth and employment.

That would give it an impossible choice: halt its interest rate hikes and let prices keep rising, or march foward with rate increases that threaten to ramp up pressure on banks and drag the economy into a recession.

In short, there are several reasons to think the UBS-Credit Suisse merger could spook investors and exacerbate the banking crisis.",['Theron Mohamed'],2023-03-20 00:00:00

Banking giant UBS is buying troubled rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion, in a deal orchestrated by regulators in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in the global banking system.

Swiss authorities pushed for UBS to take over its smaller rival after a plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to $54 billion failed to reassure investors and the bank’s customers. Shares of Credit Suisse and other banks plunged last week after the failure of two banks in the U.S. sparked concerns about other potentially shaky institutions in the global financial system.

Credit Suisse is among the 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

The deal was “one of great breadth for the stability of international finance,” said Swiss President Alain Berset as he announced it Sunday night. “An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.”

Switzerland’s executive branch, a seven-member governing body that includes Berset, passed an emergency ordinance allowing the merger to go through without shareholder approval.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann called the sale “a clear turning point.”

Business Where to look for signs financial turmoil is hitting the U.S. economy With conditions changing by the hour, traditional economic data points — typically released monthly or quarterly with a lag — prove less helpful. Here are some better ways to gauge economic health.

“It is a historic, sad and very challenging day for Credit Suisse, for Switzerland and for the global financial markets,” Lehmann said, adding that the focus is now on the future and in particular on the 50,000 Credit Suisse employees, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland.

Following news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated financial moves to stabilize banks in the coming week. This includes daily access to a lending facility for banks looking to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice widely used during the 2008 financial crisis. Three months after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, such swap lines had been tapped for $580 billion. Added swap lines were also rolled out during market turmoil in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.

“Today is one of the most significant days in European banking since 2008, with far-reaching repercussions for the industry,” said Max Georgiou, an analyst at Third Bridge. “These events could alter the course of not only European banking but also the wealth management industry more generally.”

Colm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed the “enormous opportunities” that emerge from the takeover, and highlighted his bank’s “conservative risk culture” — a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse’s reputation for more swashbuckling, aggressive gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said the council “regrets that the bank, which was once a model institution in Switzerland and part of our strong location, was able to get into this situation at all.”

The combination of the two biggest and best-known Swiss banks, each with storied histories dating to the mid-19th century, amounts to a thunderclap for Switzerland’s reputation as a global financial center — leaving it on the cusp of having a single national champion in banking.

The deal follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further panic. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse’s share price began plummeting last week.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde lauded the “swift action” by Swiss officials, saying they were “instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.”

She said the banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.

UBS officials said they plan to sell off parts of Credit Suisse or reduce the bank’s size in the coming months and years.

The Swiss government is providing more than 100 billion francs in aid and financial backstops to make the deal go through.

As part of the deal, approximately $17.3 billion in Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out. European bank regulators use a special type of bond designed to provide a capital cushion to banks in times of distress. But these bonds are designed to be wiped out if a bank’s capital falls below a certain level, which was triggered as part of this government-brokered deal.

Berset said the Federal Council had already been discussing a long-troubled situation at Credit Suisse since the beginning of the year and held urgent meetings in the last four days amid spiraling concerns about its financial health that caused major swoons in its stock price and raised the specter of the 2007-08 financial crisis.

Investors and banking industry analysts were still digesting the deal, but at least one analyst was sour on the news because it could damage Switzerland’s global banking image.

“A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,” said Octavio Marenzi, chief executive of consulting firm Opimas LLC, in an email.

Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

The Credit Suisse parent bank is not part of European Union supervision, but it has entities in several European countries that are. Lagarde reiterated what she said last week after the central bank raised interest rates — that the European banking sector is resilient, with strong financial reserves and plenty of ready cash.

Many of Credit Suisse’s problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.

The deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably Wednesday, when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn’t invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.

On Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.

Its current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.

Although smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, and UBS did.

The Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

UBS gives 10 with the most upside,"Dividend stocks may be the way to go for investors as a recession becomes more likely, according to UBS. Dividend stocks on average outperformed the market by 4.5% during the 2001, 2008 and 2020 recessions, the bank said. U.S. equity product manager Joseph Parkhill noted that these stocks can provide a cushion for investor portfolios amid the current uncertainty as inflation remains stubbornly high. Investing strategies focusing on dividend growth ""have been significantly less volatile"" than others focusing on earnings and buyback growth, Parkhill wrote in a Monday note. ""Dividend stocks can provide a margin of safety during uncertain times."" The market has seen wild swings lately, as expectations for a recession increase, with the Federal Reserve raising rates for roughly a year to quell inflation pressures. Given this backdrop, UBS highlighted a slew of dividend stocks with big upsides, based on the bank's price targets. The stocks have current dividend yields higher than the S & P 500 average of 1.7%. Analysts also forecast three-year dividend growth that's at least in the mid-single digits, in addition to sustainable payout ratios. Here are the 10 that are expected to see the largest gains in coming months: Renewable energy-focused investment company Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure had the highest estimated upside on the list, at 92.3%. Two-thirds of analysts covering the stock rate it a buy or overweight, according to FactSet. To be sure, shares have tumbled more than 43% during the past 12 months. Despite the recent investor concerns surrounding the banking sector, several regional banks including Huntington Bancshares and Fifth Third Bancorp made the list. Huntington Bancshares' stock has fallen 20.5% in 2023. Nonetheless, UBS forecasts shares rallying 57.7%. UBS analyst Erika Najarian wrote earlier in the month that Huntington Bancshares has been especially hard-hit relative to its fundamentals, presenting a compelling entry point for investors. UBS is also bullish on Fifth Third Bancorp shares. The bank's price target implies upside of 56.9%. Amid the dip in regional bank stocks, UBS said Fifth Third's ""transition to a high quality regional appears to be fully priced out of the stock at current levels."" Other analysts are also bullish on the stock, with FactSet data showing more than six in 10 rating it a buy or overweight. Shares have declined more than 20% year to date. Insurance group American International Group was also highlighted as a dividend stock with large potential upside. AIG shares have tumbled almost 25% year to date. But, UBS sees shares gaining 64.8%. Pharmacy services giant CVS also made UBS's list. CVS shares have dropped 20.5% since the start of 2023. However, UBS anticipates upside of 37.2%.

LONDON -- Credit Suisse shares plunged Monday after Swiss authorities cut a deal with its bigger rival UBS to acquire the troubled bank at a marked-down price. But European bank stocks and the wider market gained as investors watch whether moves to shore up banks will stem further upheaval in the global financial system.

Shares of Credit Suisse, whose woes stem from questions over its internal controls, closed nearly 56% lower a day after UBS said it would buy its fellow Swiss bank for a lowball price of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion). The shares traded at about the level they are valued at in the deal.

Swiss regulators orchestrated the purchase in a bid to stop more turmoil after the collapse of two U.S. banks. In an indication of the frantic, behind-the-scenes deal-making to resolve the issue before markets opened, the acquisition was announced late Sunday.

There is still uncertainty over how the deal will play out for the combined lender and what comes next for the wider banking system. Analysts say some previous forced bank mergers didn’t work out well for shareholders in the long run.

It could be that no more banks get into trouble, but it’s also possible that “we just go from one weak institution falling over to the next,” said Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser at Capital Economics.

There no other obvious candidates that could be singled out like Credit Suisse, but it’s “hard to predict where the problems will emerge,” she said.

UBS shares initially dropped on the Swiss stock exchange but closed up 1.3%. The deal whipsawed other European bank stocks, which tumbled before some clawed back their losses. Germany’s Deutsche Bank, France’s BNP Paribas and Italy’s UniCredit ended higher, while London-based Barclays sank 2.3%.

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after a central bank plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) last week failed to reassure investors and customers.

Many of Credit Suisse's problems were unique and unlike the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S., including high interest rates. Those U.S. failures have raised questions about other potentially weak global financial institutions, sweeping up the already beleaguered Swiss bank.

Credit Suisse has faced an array of troubles in recent years, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shakeups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

Analysts and financial leaders say safeguards are stronger since the 2008 global financial crisis and that banks worldwide have plenty of available cash and support from central banks. But concerns about risks to the deal, losses for some investors and Credit Suisse's falling market value could renew fears about the health of banks.

Tobias Straumann, an economic history professor at University of Zurich, said the merger was the right move because the U.S. bank collapses and the danger to Credit Suisse was “an international banking crisis in the making.”

“Markets are very nervous, and I think an additional accident in Switzerland would have fueled a lot of problems,” he said.

Credit Suisse is among 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities were worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

UBS is bigger but Credit Suisse wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. It has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich through its wealth management business, and is a major mergers and acquisitions adviser. However, Credit Suisse weathered the 2008 financial crisis without assistance, unlike UBS.

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in higher-risk Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out, leaving investors with hefty losses. Lawyers were already circling, eyeing possible legal action to get compensation for bondholders amid concern about the market for those bonds and other banks that hold them.

The combination of the two Swiss banks, each with histories dating to the mid-19th century, strikes at the country’s reputation as a global financial center — putting it on the cusp of having a single big national bank that would be too big to fail.

Some customers were caught off guard by the turmoil, at odds with Switzerland's reputation as as stable banking haven.

Sahil Dua, an Indian software engineer living in Zurich, holds a UBS account but opened one at Credit Suisse last Tuesday, the same day the lender flagged “material weaknesses” in internal financial controls that ultimately helped spark its downward spiral.

“My impression as a customer,"" Dua said, is “that at least these two banks were going to be fine, whatever happens.”

Dua said he wanted the credit card that came with the Credit Suisse account and that he considered switching over his primary bank account and bringing his savings from UBS. Not anymore.

He has a Credit Suisse account “with a balance of zero, and I’m glad that it’s still zero because I didn't add any money yet to it.” In the future, he plans to spread out his money in more than one bank.

“I will look into diversification more seriously now,” Dua said.

As the market tries to figure out what comes next after the merger, Straumann, the professor, said he wouldn’t be surprised to see problems for regional banks in Europe after further interest rate increases, much like what happened with midsized banks in U.S.

“The banking system of Europe has not fully recovered from the crisis” in 2008, he said. “It’s better, of course, than it used to be, but it’s vulnerable.”

March 19 (Reuters) - Some of the world's largest central banks came together on Sunday to stop a banking crisis from spreading as Swiss authorities persuaded UBS Group AG (UBSG.S) to buy rival Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S) in a historic deal.

UBS will pay 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.23 billion) for 167-year-old Credit Suisse and assume up to $5.4 billion in losses in a deal backed by a massive Swiss guarantee and expected to close by the end of 2023.

Soon after the announcement late on Sunday, the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and other major central banks came out with statements to reassure markets that have been walloped by a banking crisis that started with the collapse of two regional U.S. banks earlier this month.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures were each up 0.4%, both giving back some earlier gains. New Zealand dipped at the open and Australian shares (.AXJO) opened with a 0.5% loss. The safe-haven dollar lost ground against Sterling and the euro but was up versus the yen.

Pressure on UBS helped seal Sunday's deal.

""It's a historic day in Switzerland, and a day frankly, we hoped, would not come,"" UBS Chair Colm Kelleher told analysts on a conference call. ""I would like to make it clear that while we did not initiate discussions, we believe that this transaction is financially attractive for UBS shareholders,"" Kelleher said.

UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said there were still many details to be worked through.

""I know that there must be still questions that we have not been able to answer,"" he said. ""And I understand that and I even want to apologize for it.""

In a global response not seen since the height of the pandemic, the Fed said it had joined with central banks in Canada, England, Japan, the EU and Switzerland in a coordinated action to enhance market liquidity. The ECB vowed to support euro zone banks with loans if needed, adding the Swiss rescue of Credit Suisse was ""instrumental"" for restoring calm.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen welcomed the announcement by the Swiss authorities. The Bank of England also praised the Swiss.

“The greater risk environment for financials leads to husbanding of capital and risk-taking, less and more conservative investing and lending, and inevitably, lower growth,"" said Lloyd Blankfein, former chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N).

""While some banks have been hung up by poorly managed, concentrated risk, the overall banking system is extremely well capitalized and substantially more tightly regulated than in prior challenging times.”

The Swiss banking marriage follows efforts in Europe and the United States to support the sector since the collapse of U.S. lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.

Some investors welcomed the weekend steps but took a cautious stance.

""Provided markets don’t sniff out other lingering problems, I’d think this should be pretty positive,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments.

Problems remain in the U.S. banking sector, where bank stocks remained under pressure despite a move by several large banks to deposit $30 billion into First Republic Bank (FRC.N), an institution rocked by the failures of Silicon Valley and Signature Bank.

On Sunday, First Republic saw its credit ratings downgraded deeper into junk status by S&P Global, which said the deposit infusion may not solve its liquidity problems.

U.S. bank deposits have stabilized, with outflows slowing or stopping and in some cases reversing, a U.S. official said on Sunday, adding the problems of Credit Suisse are unrelated to recent deposit runs on U.S. banks and that U.S. banks have limited exposure to Credit Suisse.

The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC), meanwhile, is planning to relaunch the sale process for Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB.O), with the regulator seeking a potential breakup of the lender, according to people familiar with the matter.

'DECISIVE INTERVENTION'

The intervention comes after two sources told Reuters earlier on Sunday that major banks in Europe were looking to the Fed and ECB to step in with stronger signals of support to stem contagion.

The euro , the pound and the Australian dollar all rose by around 0.4% against the greenback, indicating a degree of risk appetite in markets.

""Bank stocks should rally on the news, but it is premature to signal all-clear,"" said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer for Angeles Investments in California.

UBS Chair Colm Kelleher said during a press conference that it will wind down Credit Suisse's investment bank, which has thousands of employees worldwide. UBS said it expected annual cost savings of some $7 billion by 2027.

The Swiss central bank said Sunday's deal includes 100 billion Swiss francs ($108 billion) in liquidity assistance for UBS and Credit Suisse.

Credit Suisse shareholders will receive 1 UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares held, equivalent to 0.76 Swiss francs per share for a total consideration of 3 billion francs, UBS said.

Credit Suisse shares had lost a quarter of their value last week. The bank was forced to tap $54 billion in central bank funding as it tries to recover from scandals that have undermined confidence.

Under the deal with UBS, some Credit Suisse bondholders are major losers. The Swiss regulator decided that Credit Suisse bonds with a notional value of $17 billion will be valued at zero, angering some of the holders of the debt who thought they would be better protected than shareholders in a rescue deal announced on Sunday.

LONDON -- Credit Suisse shares plunged Monday after Swiss authorities cut a deal with its bigger rival UBS to acquire the troubled bank at a marked-down price. But European bank stocks and the wider market gained as investors watch whether moves to shore up banks will stem further upheaval in the global financial system.

Shares of Credit Suisse, whose woes stem from questions over its internal controls, closed nearly 56% lower a day after UBS said it would buy its fellow Swiss bank for a lowball price of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion). The shares traded at about the level they are valued at in the deal.

Swiss regulators orchestrated the purchase in a bid to stop more turmoil after the collapse of two U.S. banks. In an indication of the frantic, behind-the-scenes deal-making to resolve the issue before markets opened, the acquisition was announced late Sunday.

There is still uncertainty over how the deal will play out for the combined lender and what comes next for the wider banking system. Analysts say some previous forced bank mergers didn’t work out well for shareholders in the long run.

It could be that no more banks get into trouble, but it’s also possible that “we just go from one weak institution falling over to the next,” said Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser at Capital Economics.

There no other obvious candidates that could be singled out like Credit Suisse, but it’s “hard to predict where the problems will emerge,” she said.

UBS shares initially dropped on the Swiss stock exchange but closed up 1.3%. The deal whipsawed other European bank stocks, which tumbled before some clawed back their losses. Germany’s Deutsche Bank, France’s BNP Paribas and Italy’s UniCredit ended higher, while London-based Barclays sank 2.3%.

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after a central bank plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) last week failed to reassure investors and customers.

Many of Credit Suisse's problems were unique and unlike the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S., including high interest rates. Those U.S. failures have raised questions about other potentially weak global financial institutions, sweeping up the already beleaguered Swiss bank.

Credit Suisse has faced an array of troubles in recent years, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shakeups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

Analysts and financial leaders say safeguards are stronger since the 2008 global financial crisis and that banks worldwide have plenty of available cash and support from central banks. But concerns about risks to the deal, losses for some investors and Credit Suisse's falling market value could renew fears about the health of banks.

Tobias Straumann, an economic history professor at University of Zurich, said the merger was the right move because the U.S. bank collapses and the danger to Credit Suisse was “an international banking crisis in the making.”

“Markets are very nervous, and I think an additional accident in Switzerland would have fueled a lot of problems,” he said.

Credit Suisse is among 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities were worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

UBS is bigger but Credit Suisse wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. It has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich through its wealth management business, and is a major mergers and acquisitions adviser. However, Credit Suisse weathered the 2008 financial crisis without assistance, unlike UBS.

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in higher-risk Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out, leaving investors with hefty losses. Lawyers were already circling, eyeing possible legal action to get compensation for bondholders amid concern about the market for those bonds and other banks that hold them.

The combination of the two Swiss banks, each with histories dating to the mid-19th century, strikes at the country’s reputation as a global financial center — putting it on the cusp of having a single big national bank that would be too big to fail.

Some customers were caught off guard by the turmoil, at odds with Switzerland's reputation as as stable banking haven.

Sahil Dua, an Indian software engineer living in Zurich, holds a UBS account but opened one at Credit Suisse last Tuesday, the same day the lender flagged “material weaknesses” in internal financial controls that ultimately helped spark its downward spiral.

“My impression as a customer,"" Dua said, is “that at least these two banks were going to be fine, whatever happens.”

Dua said he wanted the credit card that came with the Credit Suisse account and that he considered switching over his primary bank account and bringing his savings from UBS. Not anymore.

He has a Credit Suisse account “with a balance of zero, and I’m glad that it’s still zero because I didn't add any money yet to it.” In the future, he plans to spread out his money in more than one bank.

“I will look into diversification more seriously now,” Dua said.

As the market tries to figure out what comes next after the merger, Straumann, the professor, said he wouldn’t be surprised to see problems for regional banks in Europe after further interest rate increases, much like what happened with midsized banks in U.S.

“The banking system of Europe has not fully recovered from the crisis” in 2008, he said. “It’s better, of course, than it used to be, but it’s vulnerable.”

https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/18/business/credit-suisse-crisis-ubs/index.html,Credit Suisse faces fateful weekend. Will UBS step up with a rescue bid?,"London CNN —

The fate of Credit Suisse could be decided in the next 24 hours after a torrid week for Switzerland’s second biggest bank.

Local media reported that the Swiss cabinet had gathered for a crisis meeting at 5 p.m. local time (12 p.m. ET) Saturday to discuss the ailing bank’s future, as reports swirled of a possible takeover by its biggest Swiss rival, UBS (UBS). A spokesperson for the Swiss finance ministry declined to comment.

Investors and customers pulled their money out of Credit Suisse over the past several days as turmoil swept the global banking industry following the collapse of two US lenders.

Shares of the bank lost 25% over the course of the week, despite an emergency $54 billion loan from the Swiss National Bank. The price of financial contracts designed to protect investors against possible losses on its bonds soared to record levels. More than $450 million was pulled from European and US funds managed by the bank between Monday and Wednesday, according to Morningstar.

The lifeline from the Swiss central bank, announced late Wednesday night after the stock had crashed to a new record low, only bought Credit Suisse (CS) some time.

Reuters and the Financial Times, citing people familiar with the matter, both reported that Swiss regulators were urging UBS to agree a rescue of Credit Suisse before markets open Monday to shore up confidence in the country’s banking system. The FT said the boards of UBS and Credit Suisse were expected to meet separately over the weekend.

Credit Suisse and UBS both declined to comment to Reuters.

BlackRock (BLK), which owns 4% of Credit Suisse, denied a separate report in the Financial Times that it was drawing up an alternative bid for all or part of the beleagured bank.

“BlackRock is not participating in any plans to acquire all or any part of Credit Suisse, and has no interest in doing so,” a BlackRock spokesperson told CNN.

Credit Suisse, which is among the 30 most important banks in the global financial system, has been on the ropes for years following a series of scandals, huge losses and strategic missteps. Its stock is down 75% over the past 12 months. But the crisis of confidence escalated rapidly this month.

The failure of Silicon Valley Bank last week, the biggest by a US lender since the global financial crisis of 2008, sent investors fleeing other players perceived as weak.

Then Credit Suisse dropped another bombshell. Publishing its annual report on Tuesday, the 167-year-old bank acknowledged “material weakness” in its financial reporting, adding it had failed to adequately identify potential risks to its financial statements.

The following day, its biggest shareholder — the Saudi National Bank — made clear it would not be pumping any more money into the bank, after spending $1.5 billion last year for a stake of almost 10%. That spooked investors.

In a note on Thursday, JPMorgan banking analysts wrote that a takeover by UBS was the most probable endgame.

UBS would likely spin off Credit Suisse’s Swiss business since the combined market share would make up about 30% of Switzerland’s domestic banking market and mean “too much concentration risk and market share control,” they added.

UBS, formerly known as the Union Bank of Switzerland, is a multinational diversified financial services company headquartered in Zurich and Basel. UBS is involved in virtually all major financial activities, including retail and commercial banking, investment banking, investment management, and wealth management.

UBS has a major presence around the globe and in the United States. It has its American headquarters in New York City. It operates in over 50 countries worldwide, with close to 60,000 employees.

Key Takeaways UBS is a Swiss investment bank with global operations.

In March 2023, UBS (UBS) announced it would absorb Credit Suisse (CS) in a $2 billion all stock deal brokered by the government to prevent the latter embattled bank from failing.

The main divisions of UBS include investment & retail banking and asset & wealth management.

Its retail banking sector facilitates private Swiss bank accounts.

The company has approximately USD $3.2 trillion in assets under management.

UBS Explained

The name UBS is derived from one of its predecessor corporations, the Union Bank of Switzerland. The current UBS originated when the Union Bank of Switzerland merged with the Swiss Bank Corporation in 1998. Thus, UBS is now used as the company's official name and not as an acronym.

The UBS logo consists of three keys, a symbol taken from the Swiss Bank Corporation. The keys symbolize confidence, security, and discretion.

UBS’s Major Divisions

UBS has several major divisions, offering products and services to numerous clients. These divisions include wealth management, asset management, investment banking, and retail banking.

Wealth Management

UBS wealth management covers both high net worth and ultra-high net-worth individuals. The division’s financial advisors work with clients to understand the breadth of their financial and other assets and develop tailored solutions to meet their needs. Financial advisors may specialize in services, such as investment management, income tax preparation, or estate planning.

Asset Management

The investment aim of UBS asset management is to “deliver superior investment performance and client service.” Asset management differs from wealth management in that it can also describe managing collective investments (such as a pension fund) in addition to overseeing individual assets. For this reason, some deem asset management to encompass wealth management.

UBS has more than CHF 2.8 trillion in invested assets in 2022 and is the largest bank in Switzerland.

Investment Banking

UBS investment bank is considered one of the bulge bracket banks, along with Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, and Deutsche Bank.

Investment banks underwrite new debt and equity securities for all types of corporations, aid in the sale of these securities, and help to facilitate mergers and acquisitions, reorganizations, and broker trades for institutions and private investors. At times, investment banks also provide guidance to issuers regarding the issue and placement of stock.

Retail Banking

UBS retail banking is what many traditionally view as mass-market banking, wherein individual customers use the local branches of larger commercial banks. Other examples of retail banks include Citibank and T.D. Bank.

UBS retail bank offers savings and checking accounts, mortgages, personal loans, debit or credit cards, and certificates of deposit (CDs). The focus is on the individual consumer.

What Does UBS Stand For? UBS is the acronym for Union Bank of Switzerland (""Union de Banques Suisses"" or ""Unione di Banche Svizzere"" in French or Italian, respectively. In German, it's ""Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft""). When Union Bank merged with Swiss Bank, the new entity took on the name UBS.

Is UBS a US Bank? While UBS is based in Switzerland, it also operates as a licensed U.S. bank, headquartered in New York City and registered in Utah, known as UBS Bank USA.

What Does UBS Wealth Management Do? UBS Wealth Management provides a range of financial planning services for individuals and businesses. These include portfolio management, market research, retirement planning, and educational planning.

The Bottom Line

UBS is a Swiss investment bank with global operations; it operates in more than 50 countries worldwide, with close to 60,000 employees. Its primary divisions include investment and retail banking, and asset and wealth management. This financial institution has a major presence in the United States, including at its American headquarters in New York City.

In EMEA, we generated USD 20bn of net new fee-generating assets1 and we completed the sale of our domestic wealth management business in Spain, which further optimizes our footprint.

Patrick McHenry, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said the contributions from a fundraiser that Signature Bank threw him prior to the bank’s collapse weren’t processed and have been returned.

“So when people contribute to me, it's an endorsement of my agenda -- not the other way around,” McHenry said, when pressed by CNN on whether he should recuse himself from any investigations into the bank failures. “In this circumstance, we had not processed the contributions and we returned them all.”

The fundraiser was first reported by Bloomberg.

McCarthy later defended his chairman, saying McHenry “doesn’t raise money because these people are influencing him” and pointed out that “there’s a limited amount that someone can provide in this process” anyway.

During a pen-and-pad with reporters at the House GOP policy retreat, McHenry and other top Republicans talked about the need to bring in bank executives to answer questions about the recent bank failures and dismissed the idea that loosening the Dodd-Frank law in 2018 had anything to do with their collapse.

Republicans demurred on whether a legislative response, such as insuring deposits beyond $250,000, is necessary, saying they need to get more information first.

UBS named Sergio Ermotti as its new Group CEO on Wednesday, following the recent acquisition of Credit Suisse. The move will be effective April 5, UBS said in a statement. Shares of UBS were up 2% at the open. Ermotti — who was group CEO at UBS for nine years from November 2011 to October 2020 — will replace the current CEO Ralph Hamers. Ermotti is currently the chairman of insurance company Swiss Re. Hamers will remain at UBS to advise the bank during the transition period to ""ensure a successful closure of the transaction and a smooth hand-over,"" the company said. In a deal orchestrated by Swiss regulators, Switzerland's largest bank UBS agreed on March 19 to buy its embattled rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion). The move came as governments looked to stem a contagion threatening the global banking system. The leadership change comes ""in light of the new challenges and priorities facing UBS after the announcement of the acquisition,"" UBS said Wednesday.

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon UBS brings back Sergio Ermotti as CEO

The statement pointed to how Ermotti ""successfully repositioned"" the bank following the 2008 global financial crisis, and ""achieved a profound culture change within the bank."" That allowed the Swiss lender to ""regain the trust of clients and other stakeholders, while restoring people's pride in working for UBS,"" the bank said. Hamers told employees of the government-orchestrated takeover that UBS ""did not buy Credit Suisse only to close it,"" Reuters reported. In the announcement, UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher called Hamers an ""outstanding"" CEO who led UBS to ""unprecedented success despite a challenging environment."" While the acquisition of Credit Suisse supports UBS' existing strategy, it imposes new priorities on the group, he said. ""With his unique experience, I am very confident that Sergio will deliver the successful integration that is so essential for both banks' clients, employees and investors, and for Switzerland,"" Kelleher said.

'Part of the fallout'

The move surprised some market observers, but one analyst said it was just part of the fallout from the merger deal. As with ""all forced mergers or an acquisition of not equal parties, you can always have this friction and I think that's what you see at play here,"" Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, told CNBC on Wednesday. ""It was very clear that the now former CEO at UBS was not really happy about this shotgun wedding and I think that's the fallout you see now.""

Notably, in an interview with Swiss newspaper NZZ am Sonntag in September, Ermotti argued that there was no ""compelling"" economic reason for Switzerland to have two big banks. ""Everything we have seen, I think, since the global financial crisis with regulation is leading us down one path, of bigger and bigger and banks, more and more concentration, which leads to fragility but also less competition and I'm not sure it's long term going to be good for the overall financial system,"" Garnry argued. ""It puts the conversation out there: are we moving towards more public interference with money itself?"" He said the discussions in the U.S. after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is, ""to what degree should there be guarantees on deposits above the FDIC deposit guarantee limit? If you do that, what is the purpose of having banks, private money etc?"" ""I think there are big questions here about this and where we're heading in the banking system,"" Garnry said.

In a press briefing following the announcement, Kelleher stressed that Ermotti's Swiss nationality is a ""nice thing,"" but not a main driver behind the appointment decision. He stressed the ""significant execution risk"" of implementing UBS' takeover of Credit Suisse, noting the new CEO's expertise best equips him as the ""best pilot"" to navigate the challenge. He signaled the Swiss government were advised of Ermotti's designation. ""Clearly regulators have a right of saying no. So we have to make sure that there is approval and Sergio is approved for this role,"" he said. Ermotti expressed interest to remain in the position long term, saying that the tasks ahead align with his vision for UBS. ""There is a sense in me, and I felt, a sense of call of duty aspect. And also, frankly speaking, I always thought that despite all these discussions around the size of the bank, I always felt that the next chapter I wanted to write back then was a chapter of doing a transaction like this one,"" he said.

The 'Impeccable' Logic Of UBS-Credit Suisse Deal, According To One Analyst - UBS Gr (NYSE:UBS)","UBS Group AG UBS shares jumped Monday morning after the bank's Sunday agreement to buy Credit Suisse Group AG CS for $3.25 billion. On Monday, one analyst said the Credit Suisse acquisition makes UBS an attractive investment.

The UBS Analyst: Bank of America analyst Alastair Ryan upgraded UBS from Neutral to Buy and raised the price target from $22.72 to $24.87.

Related Link: First Republic Bank Tumbles, S&P 500 Volatility Continues Ahead Of Next Week's Critical Federal Reserve Meeting

The UBS Takeaways: In the upgrade note, Ryan said UBS should expect substantial cost synergies from the merger. The bank estimates synergies of around $8 billion by 2027, which is roughly 19% of the combined 2022 cost base.

""The industrial logic is impeccable: CS was the closest competitor to UBS in wealth management and Switzerland; and both banks are heavy in Swiss central costs,"" the analyst said.

Credit Suisse boosts UBS's share of Swiss deposits to around 30% and increases its total invested assets by 25% to $5 trillion. In addition, Ryan said UBS's investment bank balance sheet will now represent a smaller 25% of its total balance sheet, down from around 33% historically.

""We see UBS's capital generation being strong enough to maintain the current dividend policy, with high payouts ongoing should litigation cases be settled and so long as the balance sheet allocated to the IB remains constrained,"" Ryan said.

For now, he said UBS maintains a strong cash position and is significantly above a 13% Common Equity Tier 1 ratio.

He added that Credit Suisse helps boost UBS's scale in its core business.

Bank of America projects UBS's EPS will drop 7.7% in 2023 but rebound by 28.7% in 2024.

UBS Price Action: UBS shares were trading 4.04% higher at $18.93 late Monday morning.

Benzinga's Take: The market certainly approves of the acquisition given UBS's price action on Monday morning. Investors should expect the entire banking sector to remain volatile until the macroeconomic environment stabilizes.

LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - UBS Group (UBSG.S) has emerged as Switzerland’s one and only global bank with a state-backed rescue of its smaller peer Credit Suisse, a risky bet that makes the Swiss economy more dependent on a single lender.

The move announced late on Sunday in Zurich capped a race against time by regulators to avert a meltdown. Switzerland is pledging roughly 260 billion francs($170 billion) in loans and guarantees to underpin the new group, guarding against further risks undermining the lender.

The transaction – the first rescue of a global bank since the financial crisis of 2008 – grants enormous clout to UBS, ridding it of its main rival. It will change the landscape of banking in Switzerland, where branches of Credit Suisse and UBS are dotted everywhere, sometimes just metres apart.

The banks, two of the most systemically relevant in global finance, hold combined assets of up to 140% of Swiss gross domestic product in a country heavily dependent on finance for its economy.

Following the 2008 financial crash, politicians pledged never to bail out banks again. The Credit Suisse rescue, orchestrated with public money, shows banks' continued vulnerability and how their problems can quickly rebound on their home country.

Rescuing Credit Suisse alone came with a price tag of roughly 260 billion francs of publicly backed loans and guarantees - a third of the Alpine state's economic output.

""The terms of the takeover are very much in UBS's favour,"" said Tobias Straumann of the University of Zurich. ""They were in a strong negotiating position because they didn't want the deal.""

""Under normal circumstances, I would say it is an absolutely fantastic deal for UBS,"" said Johann Scholtz, an analyst at Morningstar.

REVERSAL OF FORTUNES

Soon after the announcement, central banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan said they would enhance dollar swap lines, helping calm investors rattled by turmoil in the banking sector.

The failure of two U.S. banks and a rout in Credit Suisse shares have sent shock waves through markets over the past week.

UBS will pay $3.2 billion for 167-year-old Credit Suisse and assume at least $5.4 billion in losses from unwinding its portfolio of derivatives and other risky assets. Credit Suisse had a market value of about $8 billion at the close on Friday.

Holders of Credit Suisse’s Additional Tier 1 bonds will get wiped out.

The deal marks a twist of fate for the banks. During the great financial crash, it was UBS and not Credit Suisse that needed state support.

The banks' fortunes have diverged sharply over the past year. UBS earned $7.6 billion in profit in 2022, while Credit Suisse lost $7.9 billion. Credit Suisse's shares were down 74% from a year ago, while UBS's are relatively flat.

UBS becomes the undisputed global leader in managing money for the wealthy, with UBS’s leading position in China now complemented by Credit Suisse’s strength in the rest of Asia, the fastest growing region.

UBS also gets to keep the jewel in Credit Suisse’s crown, the domestic bank.

""In the past, when a deal between Credit Suisse and UBS was discussed, a sticking point would be concentration, especially in the domestic market,"" said Morningstar’s Scholtz. ""It is also the most stable part of the business, that generates quite a lot of cash.""

UBS is also taking out a big competitor in securities trading. UBS earned $7.1 billion in revenue from buying and selling stocks, currencies and bonds. Credit Suisse posted about$3.2 billion last year.

STILL SWISS

Credit Suisse's demise has been a blow to Switzerland's reputation for banking and sent shockwaves through global finance.

At a news conference announcing the deal, finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter defended the rescue, saying it was good for Credit Suisse account holders, including her. She said she also banked with UBS. That choice of banks will soon end.

""This solution has risks,"" she conceded, playing down any concerns about the size of the new bank, arguing that any alternative to resolve Credit Suisse's problems risked ""irreparable economic turmoil"".

Seated to her right, UBS Chair Colm Kelleher said the new group would be trimmed of risks, such as investment banking, to fit UBS's conservative culture.

""A new UBS will remain rock solid,"" he said.

Credit Suisse Chair Axel Lehmann, in contrast, was downcast as his bank proved unable to bounce back from a series of scandals and losses.

Late last year, speculation that the bank would go bust drove clients to pull out tens of billions, sealing its fate.

He described Sunday as a ""historic, sad day"".

Employees at the headquarters in Zurich are bracing for massive job cuts, with 10,000 positions potentially on the line, sources told Reuters on Saturday.

Still, it won't be all plain sailing for UBS.

The bank faces risks to complete the deal, potential litigation charges, and regulators may ask the lender to hold more capital in the future, said analysts at Jefferies.

Crucially, management will be distracted by this deal for many months, maybe years, they said.

""We will change, but we will not change that much,"" said UBS Chief Executive Officer Ralph Hamers, who will lead the new banking behemoth. ""We will still be Swiss.""

""We are happy to have found a solution, which I'm convinced will bring lasting stability and security for clients, staff, financial markets and to Switzerland.""

""The accelerating loss of confidence and the escalation over the last few days have made it clear that Credit Suisse can no longer exist in its current form,"" Lehmann said.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann told a press conference Sunday that the ""latest developments that emanated from the banks in the U.S. hit us at the most unfavorable moment.""

The announcement of a loan of up to 50 billion Swiss francs from the Swiss National Bank failed to soothe investor concerns and eventually necessitated the 167-year-old institution's ""emergency rescue"" by UBS.

After years of heavy losses and costly scandals , Credit Suisse's most recent share price plunge began with the collapse of U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and was compounded when top investor the Saudi National Bank said it could not provide any more financial assistance.

Despite bold proclamations from Swiss authorities and central banks about a return to stability, the deal does not appear to have laid to rest concerns about systemic risks to global markets.

In equal parts ""shotgun wedding"" and arranged marriage, UBS agreed to buy stricken domestic rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion) on Sunday.

The cut-price deal is expected to close this year and creates a banking behemoth with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets. The deal also includes support from the Swiss government, financial regulator FINMA, and the Swiss National Bank (SNB), which will offer a liquidity line of up to 100 billion Swiss francs, backed by a federal default guarantee. The government will offer a loss guarantee of up to 9 billion Swiss francs, with UBS assuming the first 5 billion of potential losses.

Shares of both UBS and Credit Suisse plunged on Monday morning, however.

Clarity at last?

Goldman Sachs said in a note late Sunday that the deal and associated liquidity and loss guarantees provided ""clarity"" and dampened tail risks. The U.S. bank has shifted back to an overweight allocation on European banks as a result.

""Of course, we are mindful that the situation among U.S. regional banks remains fluid. But as we discussed on Friday, we take comfort from the limited contagion from U.S. regional banks to larger money center banks, a trend we expect will persist,"" the Wall Street giant's credit strategists said.

Goldman also reiterated its favorable view on U.S. ""money center"" banks, a view echoed by Smead Capital Management's CEO Cole Smead, who said interest rate rises from central banks help lenders ""that don't do stupid things in their assets.""

""Poor stock markets have caused investment banks to be the laggards, but commercial banks look good next to them,"" he said via email, naming JPMorgan and Bank of America as stocks he particularly likes.

Smead also said investors could expect higher returns on assets from the new UBS-Credit Suisse entity, along with more consolidation in the European banking sector.

But bigger questions remain over the potential market impact of the deal. James Sym, head of equities at London-based investment manager River and Mercantile, told CNBC that the market was in ""seek and destroy mode.""

""This solves what I think is probably an idiosyncratic problem at Credit Suisse, but I'm not sure it's a firebreak big enough to stop the rot for the market,"" he said Monday. Although he added that the rest of the European banking system is ""much more robust"" than it was.""

Since the Global Financial Crisis, the continent's banks have built much larger capital buffers in order to withstand systemic risks.

Sym suggested that if European bank shares fall significantly as a result of the deal, he might ""start to nibble"" at some stocks, potentially even UBS.

""In the short term, the market is not going to like this deal for UBS, it's not core to the strategy, but I think over the medium term it does potentially give them an edge to compete globally with the Americans and really puts them in an unassailable position domestically.""

Risks remain

While the deal could bring an end to doubts about the viability of Credit Suisse as a business, some analysts still believe the devil will be in the detail as the finer points are hashed out over the coming weeks and months.

""One issue is that the reported price of $3.25bn (CHF0.5 per share) equates to ~4% of book value, and about 10% of Credit Suisse's market value at the start of the year,"" said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics.

""This suggests that a substantial part of Credit Suisse's $570bn assets may be either impaired or perceived as being at risk of becoming impaired. This could set in train renewed jitters about the health of banks.""

Shearing added that there may yet be risks to the deal ""for legal or financial reasons, or if confidence in UBS is dented and it gets cold feet about the deal.""

""Only time will tell how this shotgun wedding is received,"" he added.

The AT1 bond issue

As part of the deal, Swiss regulator FINMA announced the wipeout of 16 billion Swiss francs' worth of Credit Suisse's Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds, which some investors fear signals further spillover risk for global credit.

This was a major focal point for analysts assessing the potential ramifications on Monday morning.

""AT1 bonds were introduced in Europe after the global financial crisis to serve as shock absorbers when banks start to fail,"" explained Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer at Syz Bank.

""They are designed to impose permanent losses on bondholders or be converted into equity if a bank's capital ratios fall below a predetermined level, effectively propping up its balance sheet and allowing it to stay in business.

UBS Group AG has struck a deal to buy Credit Suisse—a rival Swiss bank rocked by financial turmoil—for over $3 billion, the two banks announced Sunday, as bank executives and Swiss officials sprint to contain a crisis sparked in part by the collapse of two major U.S. banks last week.

Key Facts

UBS ultimately agreed to pay $3.2 billion (or 3 billion Swiss Francs) in an all-share deal, with Credit Suisse investors receiving one UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares held, up from a $1 billion initial offer that Credit Suisse reportedly viewed as too low. The deal represents a large discount compared to Credit Suisse’s market capitalization just two days ago: UBS says the acquisition will cost the equivalent of $0.82 (or 0.76 Swiss Francs) per share, less than half Credit Suisse’s $2.01 share price when markets closed Friday. The combined company will have over $5 trillion in total invested assets, and UBS expects to make $8 billion in cost cuts over the next four years, UBS said in a statement late Sunday. The Swiss government helped broker the deal, with an apparent goal of completing the merger before Asian markets open Monday morning. As part of the agreement, the Swiss National Bank—the country’s central bank—offered Credit Suisse and UBS up to $108 billion in liquidity assistance loans, it said in a statement. The Swiss government is also expected to speed the deal up by waiving the six-week waiting period normally required before a merger, according to the New York Times, and Swiss authorities are not requiring UBS to get shareholder approval.

Crucial Quote

“With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,” the Swiss National Bank said.

Big Number

$54 billion. That’s how much Credit Suisse borrowed from the Swiss National Bank on Thursday. The central bank offered to provide liquidity to Credit Suisse “if necessary” hours earlier, but the bank’s share price still slid almost 7% the following day.

Key Background

Shares of Credit Suisse have plummeted in recent weeks, and trading was halted Wednesday after the share price fell up to 21%. On Tuesday, the bank said it had found “material weaknesses” in its 2021 and 2022 financial reporting processes. In response, its biggest backer, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn’t buy any more shares in Credit Suisse. The recent collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S., triggered partially by rising interest rates, caused uncertainty about wider vulnerabilities in the banking system worldwide—concerns that intensified after warning signs appeared at Credit Suisse. But the bank’s downfall wasn’t directly caused by SVB and Signature, and its problems predate the current crisis, as it ended the 2022 fiscal year with a loss of nearly $8 billion. The bank itself and some executives and advisors have also recently been linked to scandals, including alleged fraud and failing to prevent money laundering.

Data provided to Financial News by Morningstar shows net outflows from around 300 EU and US domiciled Credit Suisse CSGN, -1.29% CS, +1.05% funds have reached $5.6 billion over the three weeks since the tie-up.

The latest outflows will pile pressure on the merged firm; investors had already pulled around $3 billion from Credit Suisse funds in the week surrounding the shotgun wedding.

The latest figures show an additional $2.5 billion of net outflows from Credit Suisse funds between March 23 and April 6.

“It is fair to say that there is still uncertainty around the deal and the potential impact that it may have on Credit Suisse Asset Management,” Johann Scholtz, an equity analyst at Morningstar told FN.

Heavy outflows from Credit Suisse funds began on March 14, the day the bank said it had discovered “material weaknesses” in its financial reporting controls.

Credit Suisse declined to comment.

The largest daily outflows remain those recorded on March 21 — two days after the landmark deal was announced — when $776 million was pulled from Credit Suisse’s European funds.

Despite the steady outflows in recent weeks, the Morningstar figures show Credit Suisse’s European funds posted net inflows of more than $240 million over April 5 and April 6 — an early indication that investor jitters are starting to subside.

The flows data does not include all the asset manager’s funds in Europe and the U,S,, and represents only those funds that report daily figures to Morningstar.

Laith Khalaf, head of investments at online platform AJ Bell, said the bulk of fund outflows in the days surrounding the tie-up with UBS UBSG, -1.44% UBS, +1.29% was likely driven by investors worried about the stability of Credit Suisse and those spooked by wider banking sector turmoil.

“Those assets should be ring-fenced in the event of an insolvency, but investors might have decided that a belt-and-braces approach was required given the febrile market conditions at the time,” he said.

The $3.25 billion tie-up between UBS and Credit Suisse — the biggest merger between two systematically integral banks since the 2008 global financial crisis — also combined the banks’ respective asset management units, creating Europe’s largest money manager with $1.5 trillion.

UBS announced on March 29 that former boss Sergio Ermotti would return to oversee the merger. Ermotti, who stepped down as UBS chief in 2020 after nine years in the role, took over from Ralph Hamers at the start of April.

Analysts told FN last month that Ermotti would likely face significant challenges bringing together the two management arms, citing differences in corporate cultures, overlapping product ranges and technology issues.

Scholtz said some outflows in recent weeks may have been driven by Credit Suisse’s wealth management clients moving to other firms to “lower their concentration risk” if they are already using similar wealth products and services offered by UBS.

Similarly, some institutional investors with allocation to Credit Suisse funds may want to diversify if they are also UBS Asset Management clients, he said.

By Hannah Lang, Chris Prentice and Ann Saphir

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's Board of Governors on Friday said it has approved UBS Group AG's acquisition of the U.S. subsidiaries of Credit Suisse, clearing another major hurdle for the completion of the Swiss-brokered rescue deal.

UBS has committed to give the U.S. central bank an implementation plan for combining its U.S. business and operations with those of Credit Suisse within three months of consummating the deal, the Fed's Board said in a statement. The plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution, the statement said.

The U.S. central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

UBS had requested the Fed's approval of the merger March 22, the Fed said.

After years of scandal and losses, 167-year-old Credit Suisse came to the brink of collapse before Zurich-based rival UBS rode to the rescue with a merger engineered and bankrolled by the Swiss authorities last month. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

The Swiss authorities and UBS Group AG have been racing to close the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG within as little as a month, in an effort to retain the lender's clients and employees, Reuters previously reported.

UBS secured a temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, people familiar with the process told Reuters.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

The Fed subjects firms with more than $700 billion in assets, or more than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activities, to heightened supervision, including annual company-run stress tests and increased liquidity standards.

March may have been the cruelest month for financial firms, but April is showing the tenderest shoots of growth emerging. The collapse of Credit Suisse Group AG on March 19 into the arms of UBS Group AG resulted in $17 billion of the riskiest junior debt being wiped out, effectively closing the market. But insurance companies are cautiously reopening the market for new subordinated debt, paving the way for banks to eventually follow.The writedown to zero delivered a seismic shock to the bank capital market, despite there being clear provisions in the prospectus. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group’s Inc.’s private clients lost more than $700 million on Credit Suisse’s riskiest bonds, Bloomberg News reported, underlining the global impact. Average yields in Europe’s secondary market are still around 11%, too expensive for most banks even if investor demand could be found.

Greed will inevitably overcome fear, though it might take a pause in central banks’ interest-rate hiking cycle to focus fund managers’ minds on what’s an acceptable yield to compensate for the risk of owning bonds that regulators might make worthless in the event of a bank collapse.Banks are generally much better capitalized over the past decade, so most have sufficient breathing room before needing to raise new equity-related debt. But the regulatory requirement to have sufficient debt cover at all levels of the capital stack hasn’t gone away. That very much includes securities with risk of being bailed in, as that’s the base that supports the whole bank regulatory structure. The AT1 market must move on eventually — and the regulators will be keen for it to do so as an extended hiatus renders the system dysfunctional.

At first glance it looks as if financial sector bond sales are very healthy, contributing almost half of total issuance in April and almost 40% in March. Sovereign-related supply is still marginally ahead overall year-to-date as January and February usually see heavy government syndicated-bond issuance - before financial and corporate deals start appearing in scale.

However, since mid-March any bank deals have been almost totally weighted to senior-preferred and covered deals secured by assets such as mortgages, neither of which is at risk of being bailed in. Banks are simply issuing where they can — and for the past month it is only really in these super-safe ring-fenced bonds. Bear in mind there is a general need to replenish funding as around €1 trillion ($1.1 trillion) of liquidity to the banking sector from the European Central Bank expires by June.

BNP Paribas SA was the first European bank after Credit Suisse’s collapse to issue senior non-preferred debt, with a €1 billion 4.25% eight-year green deal last week. This can be converted into tier 1 equity at the behest of regulators but only after all subordinated debt is wiped out first. It met a muted response, with an order book of barely one-and-a-half times covered. It also has the unfortunate accolade of being the only bond issued in April to see its credit spread widen since launch, even with the added attractiveness of its green label.

ABN Amro Bank NV had better luck on Thursday with a €2.75 billion two-tranche senior deal. The Dutch bank issued a two-year preferred security as well as a five-year non-preferred tranche. The latter offered a premium 100 basis points higher than the shorter-dated deal over respective benchmarks, illustrating the extra yield investors require for buying bank debt with even a modicum of regulatory risk attached. Both types of senior deals received orders for more than twice the issued size.

The clear guidance in a speech on March 28 from ECB Supervisory Chair Andrea Enria on bail-in capital rules during future bank failures should offer reassurance that in the euro area, AT1 debt will only be triggered after core equity has been depleted. But more needs to be done by regulators to encourage the revival of this fundamental cornerstone of the banking system — otherwise strong banks will just increasingly skip the opportunity to redeem their existing callable perpetual debt early. This will keep the market effectively shut for smaller institutions that may be more in need of this type of subordinated equity-like capital.

However, there are some promising signs as the first toes are being dipped in the deeper water of subordinated debt led by large insurers. Italy’s Assicurazioni Generali SpA successfully launched a €500 million 10-year Tier 2 subordinated deal on Thursday that saw an order book of nearly seven times on offer. Moreover, the yield premium on offer over the mid-swaps benchmark was reduced by 45 basis points during the sale process. That’s a hot deal. It follows a €1 billion 5.5% 20 year callable deal last week from French insurer Axa SA which saw demand of over four times that on sale. Its yield has subsequently tightened by six basis points in the secondary market.

These sales show investors are again prepared to take the additional regulatory risk if sufficiently compensated — but only on the most senior type of subordinated financial debt from highly rated stable institutions for now. The Swiss regulator’s decision to leave some of the equity value remaining, while cancelling all of the most junior debt, has rudely woken investors up to the propensity of state actors in using statutory powers. Little wonder there’s pressure for Switzerland to change its rules to mirror the ECB model. Still, there’s a price for everything, and higher yields have certainly attracted buyers in the secondary market. Banks will only venture back into issuing riskier types of debt when yields subside and there’s clear evidence of renewed investor appetite. Reopening the European subordinated bank debt market to new supply will take time, but it will get there.

https://news.yahoo.com/swiss-vote-against-ubs-deal-131801231.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,"Swiss Vote Against UBS Deal Could Be Binding, Legal Experts Say","(Bloomberg) -- The Swiss parliamentary vote last week against state guarantees for UBS Group AG’s takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG may prove more than just symbolic, some legal experts have told the Swiss media.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The government has argued that no matter the outcome of the vote, the state’s 109 billion francs ($122 billion) in guarantees for UBS to takeover Credit Suisse are binding. The government says that’s because a small number of lawmakers — the financial delegation — gave their approval at the time the deal was negotiated in March.

Neue Zuercher Zeitung and Tages-Anzeiger, the main German language newspapers, cited the same emergency law expert who disagrees with the government’s assessment. Both reports also referred to specialists who agreed with the government’s view or acknowledged there was a gray area. One suggested that lawmakers might have voted differently if they thought their ballot actually mattered.

Blick am Sonntag cited a legal expert who said parliament’s views should count, but one needs to take into account what legal obligations the government entered into before parliament said “no.” Those remain in place due to the protection of legitimate expectations and legal certainty.

Meanwhile, the parties that opposed the guarantees — Swiss People’s Party, Greens and Social Democrats — are seeking clarification, Tages-Anzeiger reported.

“What applies must now be clarified,” also in regard to future emergency decisions by the government, said Gregor Rutz, from the SVP, who also spoke of a legal gray area. He is planning to submit an application to the state political commission next week for an investigation, Tages-Anzeiger said.

UBS-Credit Suisse merger: The US Federal Reserve on Friday approved UBS Group AG taking over US subsidiaries of Credit Suisse Group. The US Fed said that the UBS Group had sought its approval to the deal on March 22.

As part of the deal, UBS will provide the Fed with “an implementation plan” for combining the US businesses of the two firms. The plan will be updated quarterly and will include UBS’ obligations to comply with more stringent “enhanced prudential standards”, the Fed said on Friday.

In a statement, the US Fed said the plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution. As per rules, the US central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

Last month, after the sudden collapse of US-based Silicon Valley Bank, investors lost confidence in Credit Suisse, which is Switzerland’s largest bank. In a matter of few days, Swiss authorities announced that UBS would buy Credit Suisse to contain further banking turmoil after the global lender had come to the brink of collapse. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets. Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

Besides the US, UBS secured temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, according to a report in Reuters.

Earlier this month, UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said that the unexpected takeover of rival Credit Suisse a significant milestone for Switzerland and for the global financial industry, which carries a “huge amount of risk”.

Addressing the annual shareholder meeting on April 5, Kelleher said that the takeover will take at least three to four years to take shape, excluding Credit Suisse’s non-core investment bank portfolio, which will have more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Describing the transaction as ""the first merger of two globally systematically important banks,"" Kelleher said the takeover ""means a new beginning and huge opportunities ahead for the combined bank and for the Swiss financial center as a whole.""

“Having a clear vision and a sound strategy is important….This transaction is the first merger of two global systemically important banks. This is not in any way an easy deal to do and brings with it execution risk,” Kelleher said.

A day before, Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann, while addressing the last AGM of the flagship bank, apologised to the shareholders for failing to contain the crisis, which led to its closure. In an emotional speech at Credit Suisse's last annual general meeting, chairman Axel Lehmann spoke of being caught off guard, pain, bitterness, accumulated scandals, and the grief that remains.

UBS (UBS) has committed to provide the Fed board an implementation plan for combining the U.S. business and operations of the merged entity.

The plan, which will be updated quarterly, ""will address UBS' (UBS) obligations to comply with more stringent enhanced prudential standards, including liquidity standards,"" the Fed board said in a statement.

The board also allowed UBS (UBS) to maintain two U.S. intermediate holding companies for one year after UBS acquires Credit Suisse's (CS) U.S. units.

The takeover was voted down by Swiss parliament's lower house days earlier. But this was mostly symbolic as a parliamentary commission already approved the rescue plan for Credit Suisse (CS).

Note that Switzerland's attorney general office is looking into events surrounding the takeover.

The considerations have yet to be finalized. Retaining Credit Suisse's (CS) Indian wealth business would mark a return for UBS (UBS) to a market it exited in 2014, the article pointed out.

India represents the second-largest footprint for Credit Suisse (CS) outside of Switzerland, according to the lender's website.

UBS and Credit Suisse both declined to comment, Bloomberg said.

The news comes after UBS (UBS) last month acquired troubled Credit Suisse (CS) in a $3.25B deal brokered by the Swiss government to stem further damage in the country's banking sector.

Swiss banking giant UBS is reportedly considering retaining Credit Suisse AG’s private banking unit in India, making a possible return to the market. This comes after UBS agreed to buy rival Credit Suisse for $3.23 billion in stock last month, and assume up to $5.4 billion in losses.

According to a report in Bloomberg, the global head of wealth management at UBS, Iqbal Khan, met with Credit Suisse executives including the local lender’s wealth head Puneet Matta in Singapore. Khan then reportedly told the Credit Suisse staff that the wealth business in India is likely to be retained.

Khan was in Credit Suisse before he left for UBS in 2019. UBS had left India by 2014, exiting the country’s private-wealth market. The return is expected to pave the way for UBS into the market as the number of billionaires in India continues to rise.

As per the report, the merger would see large parts of Credit Suisse’s investment bank wind down. The lender has just over 40 wealth management employees and around 7,000 overall employees in the country.

The deal inked between UBS and Credit Suisse last month includes $108 billion in liquidity assistance for UBS and Credit Suisse from the Swiss central bank. The federal government is providing a loss guarantee of a maximum 9 billion Swiss francs to enable UBS take over Credit Suisse.

This will be activated if losses are actually incurred on this portfolio. In that eventuality, UBS would assume the first 5 billion francs, the federal government the next 9 billion francs, and UBS would assume any further losses, the government said.

Have you ever thought about investing in a Swiss bank? It’s actually not a bad idea, especially if we’re talking about UBS Group (NYSE:UBS). First of all, UBS stock is trading at a reasonable valuation. Plus, UBS Group’s takeover of Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) shouldn’t be as troublesome as some fearmongers would have you believe.

Banking-sector contagion isn’t limited to any single nation or continent. UBS Group’s “shotgun wedding” merger with Credit Suisse demonstrated that a crisis could strike practically anywhere, anytime.

Some people are unhappy with UBS Group’s takeover of Credit Suisse, perhaps because it will create a financial sector giant. Even if they’re not pleased with the outcome, however, the acquisition is still likely to take place. So, why not wager on a power player that happens to be trading at a fair price right now?

What’s Happening With UBS Stock?

CS stock was hammered after UBS Group announced its planned buyout of Credit Suisse for $3.2 billion. Reportedly, the deal will create a bank with “assets double the size of” Switzerland’s “annual economic output.”

Meanwhile, UBS stock has dup relatively well, considering there’s a multinational banking crisis in progress. If you choose to purchase some shares now, you’ll have access to UBS Group forward annual dividend yield of 1.32%.

Additionally, you’ll get a decent value with UBS stock. As it turns out, UBS Group’s GAAP trailing-12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9.2x is below the sector median of 9.44x. Also, the company’s trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash-flow (P/CF) ratios are all lower than the respective sector medians.

And by the way, UBS Group has beaten Wall Street’s EPS forecasts during the past four quarters. So far, the company looks like a winner for growth, value and dividend investors.

Don’t Worry About UBS Group’s Merger With Credit Suisse

I’ve already mentioned that UBS Group’s merger with Credit Suisse will create a financial giant. Will the deal actually go through despite some people’s opposition, though?

Bank of America analyst Alastair Ryan doesn’t seem to be losing sleep about it. He recently upgraded UBS stock from “neutral” to “buy,” lifting his price target on the shares from $22.65 to $24.81. The analyst’s commentary about the merger was definitely upbeat:

“We think the objective of this transaction, while solving CS’ situation & associated risks for the system, is to reach a win/win, where UBS shareholders also get value out of this deal over time.”

Ryan’s optimism seems to be justified. Reportedly, the Bank of England has approved UBS Group’s takeover of Credit Suisse in the United Kingdom. Moreover, European Union antitrust regulators gave UBS Group a temporary green light (pending a review) to complete the Credit Suisse acquisition.

On top of all that, Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter declared that she doesn’t “see any stumbling blocks at the moment” concerning the merger between UBS Group and Credit Suisse.

What You Can Do Now

Even if some people are opposed to UBS Group forming a banking leviathan with Credit Suisse, let’s be honest here. The merger will probably go through whether the critics want it to or not.

So, as an investor, there’s really no need to worry about that. In addition, UBS Group has a strong quarterly earnings track record. It’s also worth noting that UBS Group offers an enticing combination of value and yield. All in all, the bull case for UBS stock is super strong and you should think about buying some shares today.

The move would give the Swiss lender a stronger foothold among the growing ranks of Indian billionaires while underscoring a return for Khan, who steered the private wealth business during his time at Credit Suisse before joining UBS in 2019.

Credit Suisse has around 40 wealth management employees in India and around 7,000 people. According to the bank's website, India is the second-largest footprint for Credit Suisse outside of Switzerland.

The considerations aren't final, the people said. UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment on the report to Bloomberg.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swiss-lower-house-votes-second-125103244.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,Swiss Lower House Censures UBS Guarantees in Symbolic Vote,"(Bloomberg) -- Switzerland’s lower house made a symbolic vote against providing state guarantees for UBS Group AG’s takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG, reflecting a high degree of public discontent with the deal.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The lower house rejected a compromise offered by the upper house, leading to a failure of the bill and ending parliamentary proceedings. Irrespective of the vote, parliament can’t stop the takeover negotiated last month as a designated committee of lawmakers had already signed off on it.

The rejection nonetheless casts a shadow over the already-fraught process of integrating two global banks, particularly as significant job cuts loom in Switzerland in a year when national elections are due. In the aftermath of the historic $3.3 billion deal, lawmakers have called for various changes including greater powers for the financial regulator Finma, though little consensus has emerged.

“The majority in parliament wanted to make a statement,” said Michael Hermann, a political scientist and head of Zurich-based research institute Sotomo. “This shows that the topic politically causes high waves in Switzerland.”

Read More: UBS Says Credit Suisse Integration Bigger Than 2008 Deals

A coalition of the populist right and the left generated enough votes to ensure the bill didn’t pass. It would have given the stamp of approval for putting state funds of as much $120 billion at stake. The Swiss People’s Party SVP, which forms the largest bloc, lobbied together with the Greens and some Social Democrats against it.

“The SVP has been insisting since 2008 that we have no bank that cannot go bankrupt,” said Pirmin Schwander, a member of the lower house for the party. The state guarantees only fuel a “narcissistic company culture” among bankers, he said.

Story continues

UBS Effect

The vote, with 103 ballots against, 71 in favor and eight abstentions, is a defeat for Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter and the delegation of senior lawmakers which agreed to the backstop on behalf of parliament before the takeover was announced in March.

The debate is unlikely to have any immediate effect on UBS, but may indicate appetite for stricter rules on the horizon. UBS has already faced questions over the combined company’s heft — double the size of the Swiss economy — and its potential local dominance. UBS’s vice chairman said last week that the bank will consider all options for Credit Suisse’s Swiss unit.

The Swiss government earlier this month said that UBS must ensure its pay structures encourage employees to avoid using the state guarantee.

Politicians and business leaders had voiced worries that the combined lender will have excessive market power, leading to a loss of competition. Despite the risks involved in integrating Credit Suisse, UBS stands to become a banking “powerhouse” post merger, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in a note Tuesday.

The deal was also met with little public enthusiasm.

During the afternoon it looked like the parliament in Bern could reach an agreement, with some Social Democrats changing their views. A stricter stance on banks — a compromise had lined out higher equity requirements and restricted bonuses — is “a major development,” Social Democrat lawmaker Roger Nordmann had said.

“The debate is ticked off now. There will be no further cleanup of the differences between parliament and government,” Sotomo’s Hermann said. “Now everyone can feel vindicated again that democracy has been eroded. This discontent with the system will further strengthen populists and the far right.”

Swiss Politics

Switzerland’s executive isn’t made up of a coalition or an outright majority, but of seven ministers from the country’s four largest parties. They usually make decisions by consensus and try to find pragmatic compromises — often outside of party lines.

Ministers don’t publicly oppose government decisions, irrespective of their parties’ stance on a matter or how they personally voted behind closed doors.

This setup means that parliament offers parties the most prominent platform to sway voters, which explains aggressive comments in that forum even if they at times lack bite.

The upper house gave its green light earlier in the day.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Lawmakers from both sides of the political spectrum again lined up to blame the government, regulators and the bank’s management for failures around the takeover last month. Two hours into the debate in the lower house, it wasn’t clear if a vote on the guarantees would be held Tuesday night.

Damien Cottier, an MP with the Liberal-Radicals, called the day the deal was struck a “day of shame” for Switzerland before going on to call it the “least-bad and least risky” option.

Cottier’s tone reflects that of many frustrated lawmakers who are critical — and in an election year want to be seen as being so — of the banks and the government while at the same time are wary of trying to block the deal. Though parliament doesn’t have the power to derail the takeover, the extraordinary session has forced the government to once again defend the unpopular emergency takeover by UBS Group AG announced on March 19.

In that vein, Swiss President Alain Berset opened the lower-house debate after 7pm local time by saying Credit Suisse’s “negative spiral” spurred his government into action. Temporary nationalisation, a forced bankruptcy and orderly wind-down of the bank were all considered but rejected in favor of the UBS takeover, he said.

The government, Swiss National Bank and Swiss banking regulator Finma “acted in a decisive manner to restore confidence,” Berset said.

Earlier in the day, more than a dozen lawmakers in the upper house voiced their grievances. Their concerns varied from being circumvented in the emergency legislation, to regulatory lapses that allowed Credit Suisse’s failings to go un-addressed, to demanding accountability for the bank’s management.

“The legal possibilities against the bankers responsible and the possibilities to claw back bonuses need to be exhausted to the fullest extent,” said the president of the Free Democrats Thierry Burkart.

Some legislators called for greater powers for the financial regulator, Finma, amid a broader review of too-big-to-fail rules for the sector, while others asked for a parliamentary inquiry commission. Quick legislative changes are unlikely though, as became apparent during the debate.

The deal — described by Berset earlier as the best option to re-establish confidence in markets — created a banking giant whose assets are more than twice the size of the Swiss economy.

Job Cuts

Politicians and business leaders have voiced worries that the combined lender will have excessive market power, leading to a loss of competition. Despite the risks involved in integrating Credit Suisse, UBS stands to become a banking “powerhouse” post merger, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in a note Tuesday.

UBS, already one of the world’s largest wealth managers, is now taking over a key rival for a fraction of the value of its assets and receiving as much as 9 billion Swiss francs in government loss guarantees.

Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter made clear that if these guarantees turned out to be not enough, it would be up to parliament to decide on an extension. The government and UBS agreed on the lender taking on the first 5 billion francs in potential losses, before the administration steps in for the next 9 billion.

Before the takeover, Credit Suisse had already planned to cut as many as 9,000 jobs worldwide over the coming years. The overlaps between the two banks’ businesses will likely lead to that number rising, though executives including UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher have said that it’s too early to say how big the cuts will be.

‘Finma Failed’

Finma didn’t move in time, said Heidi Z’graggen, upper-house member of the Center Alliance.

“Finma’s job is to protect shareholder rights and ensure functioning of the financial center,” she said. “At this, Finma failed.”

A parliamentary inquiry commission is necessary to answer whether the financial regulator, the Swiss National Bank and the finance ministry reacted properly, she said. Such a body would have subpoena powers to summon witnesses.

Given the merger has been met with little public enthusiasm, parliament is also trying to curtail government powers in the future: They are attempting to block the use of emergency measures to push through deals like this.

https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/fed-approves-ubs-credit-suisse-deal-us-2023-04-14/,Federal Reserve green lights UBS-Credit Suisse deal in US,"













WASHINGTON, April 14 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's Board of Governors on Friday said it has approved UBS Group AG's acquisition of the U.S. subsidiaries of Credit Suisse, clearing another major hurdle for the completion of the Swiss-brokered rescue deal.

UBS has committed to give the U.S. central bank an implementation plan for combining its U.S. business and operations with those of Credit Suisse within three months of consummating the deal, the Fed's Board said in a statement. The plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution, the statement said.

The U.S. central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

UBS had requested the Fed's approval of the merger March 22, the Fed said.

After years of scandal and losses, 167-year-old Credit Suisse came to the brink of collapse before Zurich-based rival UBS rode to the rescue with a merger engineered and bankrolled by the Swiss authorities last month. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

The Swiss authorities and UBS Group AG have been racing to close the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG within as little as a month, in an effort to retain the lender's clients and employees, Reuters previously reported.

UBS secured a temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, people familiar with the process told Reuters.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

The Fed subjects firms with more than $700 billion in assets, or more than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activities, to heightened supervision, including annual company-run stress tests and increased liquidity standards.

GS, +1.44% on Wednesday drew an upgrade to buy from hold at UBS on the stock’s attractive valuation and lower risk profile than its peers.

UBS also upgraded boutique investment bank Evercore Inc. EVR, +0.22% by two notches to buy from sell and adjusted price targets for Morgan Stanley MS, +1.19% , as well as wealth-management specialists Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW, -1.40% , Ameriprise Financial Inc. AMP, +0.35% , LPL Financial Holdings Inc. LPLA, +1.78% , Stifel Financial Corp. SF, +1.32% and Regions Financial Corp. RF, +0.65% .

Analyst Brennan Hawken said Goldman Sachs “appears well positioned to outperform amidst elevated levels of market volatility” with potential growth in its asset- and wealth-management business and transactional banking.

Goldman Sachs offers less exposure to consumer deposits and commercial banking than other firms, analysts said.

The investment bank also enjoys an opportunity to accelerate its asset-management business through “attractively priced mergers and acquisitions,” Hawken said.

UBS hiked Goldman’s price target to $385 a share from $350 a share.

Shares of Goldman Sachs rose 0.8%.

Evercore stock rose 1.5% after UBS rated the bank a buy and lifted its price target to $135 a share from $112.

Hawken said Evercore “is executing better than expected” in the downtrodden business of mergers and acquisition advisory services.

While M&A completion volumes were down 50% in the first quarter, UBS is forecasting a less severe 20% drop in its M&A advisory business.

The figure indicates that Evercore’s investment-banking relationships “are strong enough to generate over $500 million per quarter even though financing banks are in a better competitive position,” Hawken said.

In terms of price-target adjustments, Evercore and Goldman were the only two out of 11 financial stocks covered by UBS to get increases instead of price cuts on Wednesday.

UBS reduced its price target for Morgan Stanley to $98 a share from $108 and reiterated a buy rating.

UBS also reiterated buy ratings on Schwab and Ameriprise and cut their price targets to $70 from $90 for the former and to $285 from $400 for the latter.

UBS reiterated a neutral rating on LPL Financial and cut its price target on the stock to $215 from $235.

Analysts also reiterated a neutral rating on Stifel Financial and cut their price target by $6 to $62. A neutral rating was reiterated for Regions Financial, while its price target was reduced to $100 from $130.

UBS reiterated a buy rating on Houlihan Lokey Inc. HLI, +2.44% and cut its price target to $105 from $115. It kept its neutral rating on Lazard Ltd. LAZ, +3.45% and reduced its price target to $32 from $40. It also reiterated a sell rating on Moelis & Co. MC, +1.76% and reduced its price target to $27 from $30.

TOKYO--Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities said it had sold about 95 billion yen ($710 million ) in additional tier 1 bonds issued by Credit Suisse Group AG, which is being taken over by UBS Group.

About 1,500 client accounts at the Japanese brokerage, a unit of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., held Credit Suisse's AT1 bonds, a spokeswoman said Monday. Of these, 1300 were held by individual investors, while the rest was held by corporations, she said.

On March 19, Swiss regulators announced that about 16 billion Swiss francs ($17.9 billion), of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds would be completely written down.

Richard Drew/Associated Press

Stock prices for the rest of 2023, UBS's investment chief predicts.

Markets could ""keep jumping from one narrative to another"" as economic data rolls in, Mark Haefele said.

Investors are still struggling to make sense of the US labor market, he added.

It's going to remain tricky for investors to pick stocks for the rest of this year because markets are still hooked on unpredictable economic data, according to UBS.

The Swiss bank's CIO Mark Haefele expects the choppiness stocks seen in the early months of 2023 to continue, thanks to traders' fixation on the rate of inflation and unemployment.

""So far, 2023 has been a much better year for asset class returns, with the S&P 500 up 7.5% year-to-date, but has been characterized by ever-changing market narratives,"" Haefele wrote in a note Wednesday.

The investment chief was referring to the benchmark US stock index's rebound this year from a plunge of 18% in 2022.

""The potential remains for this data-dependent market to keep jumping from one narrative to another for the rest of the year,"" he added. ""This should make it difficult for investors to navigate the coming months.""

The note comes ahead of the release later Wednesday of the monthly Consumer Price Index report, which will show how much US inflation rose in March. His bank believes the CPI will come in at 5.1% — down from 6% in February, but still far off the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

Markets will stay unpredictable even if inflation cools for a ninth month in a row, according to Haefele, because investors are still struggling to make sense of the US labor market.

Friday's nonfarm payrolls report showed the US economy added 236,000 jobs in March, its lowest print since December 2020. Investors are divided on whether that's good or bad news.

""While the optimistic interpretation of this data is that the tightness in the labor market is easing as the balance of supply and demand of labor improves, the pessimists view it as the first cracks that could be followed by much greater deterioration in the coming months,"" Haefele said.

Story continues

Worries about an economic slowdown could soon replace inflation tracking as a key focus, UBS's investment chief added.

Economists have warned that the Fed's year of aggressive interest-rate hikes will likely soon start weighing on growth – and that slowdown could drag on stocks by chipping away at listed companies' earnings.

""As inflation eases, growth may take over as the more dominant concern, perceived or otherwise,"" Haefele said.

""The optics of a decline in headline CPI to 3% may reinforce the view that growth, rather than inflation, will be driving Fed decisions and the market's performance,"" he added.

https://news.yahoo.com/swiss-parliament-grapples-compromise-ubs-072753540.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,Swiss Parliament Nears Deal on UBS Guarantees as MPs Change Vote,"(Bloomberg) -- Swiss parliament is approaching a deal to push through government guarantees for UBS Group AG’s takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG after a upper houses compromise was met with approval in the lower chamber.

Most Read from Bloomberg

“The majority of our party will vote for this proposal if the government will pursue higher capital ratios and restricted bonuses,” Social Democrat lawmaker Roger Nordmann said in the lower house in Bern on Wednesday. The stricter stance on banks is “a major development,” he said.

The 200-member lower house late on Tuesday voted against the 109 billion francs ($120 billion) in guarantees. While that was a symbolic vote that can’t stop the deal, it clashed with the upper house’s approval earlier in the day.

As a stalemate would force the bill to fail, the upper house earlier today adopted amendments in line with what their lower-house colleagues had demanded. Those provisions seek to adjust the law to limit the risks systemically relevant banks pose to taxpayers.

Comments by Nordmann and other lower-house lawmakers now suggest that a majority will be achieved in both chambers, allowing Switzerland to avoid an embarrassing situation.

Irrespective of the vote, parliament can’t stop the takeover negotiated last month as the government already got approval from a small group of senior lawmakers, which is entitled to act on behalf of parliament in case of urgency.

The key demand the upper house now passed calls on the government to revise banking laws demanding higher capital requirements and restrictions on bonuses. But lawmakers’ agreed wording only stipulates that the executive should “examine” this, not that it is “instructed” to do so.

Story continues

“We are agreed that after the events of March 19 we cannot just move on,” said Pirmin Bischof, a Center Alliance member in the upper house, referring to the day the deal was agreed. “The too-big-to-fail regulation just simply didn’t have any effect. And so we need to ask the government to come up with a changed law that will solve this problem.”

Symbolic Vote

The lower house’s rejection — just before midnight on Tuesday — highlights the anger among lawmakers on both sides of the political spectrum ahead of national elections later this year. An overall rejection would send a signal of Switzerland’s legislative not backing the deal, which some MPs suggested should be done.

“We should only approve a deal when it’s good enough for the Confederation — right now this deal is only good enough for UBS,” said Thomas Minder, adding that a ‘no’ wouldn’t be the “end of the world.”

Lawmakers also acknowledged their lack of power of actually influencing the deal.

“If we could really turn down the loans here, I believe nobody would hesitate,” said Eva Herzog of the Social Democrats.

The standoff is largely symbolic. The government had said that “if parliament refuses subsequent approval, it will be tantamount to a political reprimand” for the group of senior lawmakers that green-lit it, but would have “no legal effect.”

The Credit Suisse crisis three weeks ago has shaken Switzerland, evoking memories of the Great Financial Crisis. The government argued on Tuesday that the creation of a Swiss banking juggernaut was the best solution among a limited number of options.

In addition to state guarantees, the Swiss National Bank offered liquidity assistance. SNB sight deposit numbers published this week suggest that after accessing such money, Credit Suisse may have returned more than half of the funds.

Switzerland’s executive isn’t made up of a coalition or an outright majority, but of seven ministers from the country’s four largest parties. They usually make decisions by consensus and try to find pragmatic compromises — often outside of party lines.

Ministers don’t publicly oppose government decisions, irrespective of their parties’ stance on a matter or how they personally voted behind closed doors.

This setup means that parliament offers parties the most prominent platform to sway voters, which explains aggressive comments in that forum even if they at times lack bite.

https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/50-000-stores-could-close-193032161.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,"50,000 Stores Could Close in the Next 5 Years, UBS Says","Store closures are expected to pick up again in 2023 and could total more than 50,000 in the next five years.

That’s according to a recent report from UBS, which found that store closures in 2023 are already up significantly compared to the prior year. In the last few months, various retailers have announced plans to consolidate their store bases and close stores. Foot Locker last month announced a decision to close more than 400 stores locations through 2026 focus on higher-performing doors. Walmart also recently announced a plan to close seven underperforming stores, including its last two pickup and delivery concept locations.

More from Footwear News

By the end of 2027, UBS estimates that about 50,000 stores will close across the current U.S. store count of about 940,000 stores, meaning there would be less than 5 percent fewer stores by the end of 2027.

Retailers have announced about 2,600 store closures and 5,100 store openings for the year, according to Coresight Research cited in BDO’s bi-annual bankruptcy report. Store openings this year have been mainly led by dollar store and discount chains, which have benefitted from cost-cutting consumers.

As for the reasons for the predicted closures, UBS outlined a few key factors. For starters, the cost to run a store is going up, especially as wages increase and rents stay high. At the same time, a general slowdown in consumer spending, less available credit and e-commerce growth are also to blame.

UBS predicts e-commerce penetration to grow from its current 20 percent to 26 percent by 2027, with 25 percent of online sales being fulfilled from stores. This model also assumes that retail sales grow 4 percent annually.

Story continues

The National Retail Federation forecast that retail sales will grow between 4 percent and 6 percent in 2023, with sales reaching between $5.13 trillion and $5.23 trillion this year. While NRF has said a recession is unlikely in 2023, a recession could result in even more store closures, UBS said.

The stores at risk of closures are those of smaller chains, department stores and specialty retailers with mainly discretionary items.

“In our view, these smaller chains and mom and pops are most at risk of closures given these firms typically have less access to capital needed to invest in developing a robust omnichannel offering,” UBS analysts wrote in the report.

Meanwhile, off-price retailers and dollar stores are set to continue to grow their presence as they resonate with cost-conscious consumers.

Like store closures, retail bankruptcies are set to come back into play in a big way in 2023 after a relatively slow year in 2022. Between the start of 2023 through the end of February, six major retailers filed for bankruptcy, according to BDO’s bi-annual bankruptcy report. That’s more than the total number of retail bankruptcies in 2022.

In some cases, these bankruptcies could correlate with store closures for chains as well.

The move would give the Swiss lender a stronger foothold among the growing ranks of Indian billionaires while underscoring a return for Khan, who steered the private wealth business during his time at Credit Suisse before joining UBS in 2019.

Credit Suisse has around 40 wealth management employees in India and around 7,000 people. According to the bank's website, India is the second-largest footprint for Credit Suisse outside of Switzerland.

The considerations aren't final, the people said. UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment on the report to Bloomberg.

https://www.pr.com/press-release/884341,OutcomesX Marketplace Launches with Deal to Move Funding Directly to Ukrainian NGOs Struggling to Access International Aid; $2 Million Committed by UBS Optimus Foundation,"New York, NY, April 13, 2023 --( PR.com )-- OutcomesX , a first-of-its-kind social outcomes marketplace, launched today with a deal to transfer $2 million in relief donations from UBS Optimus Foundation clients and employees directly to local NGOs in Ukraine that are providing education and mental health services to children in-country.This comes amid recent studies revealing that red tape is preventing Ukrainian nonprofits from accessing bilateral and multilateral relief funds to help those in need inside the country’s borders. And it marks another step in UBS Optimus Foundation creating positive outcomes for resident and internally displaced Ukrainians affected by war.The way the platform works: OutcomesX recruited 63 Ukrainian nonprofit organizations to register their proof of outcomes and then set a price per outcome that captured the full cost an NGO incurred getting results. UBS Optimus Foundation selected a portfolio among those recruited and is purchasing $2 million units of outcomes (results per student) from OutcomesX, which in turn is transmitting funds directly to selected local organizations, including EdCamp and Divchata with a verification process as results unfold.The UBS Optimus Foundation is an early partner for OutcomesX, which allows nonprofits to sell outcomes across multiple social impact fields and geographies. UBS launched an emergency relief fund for Ukraine to raise funds from its clients and employees to support children in country as well as those who have been forced to flee, and it used the social outcomes marketplace as an efficient way to allocate relief funds to organizations best placed to help.Said Maya Ziswiler, CEO of UBS Optimus Foundation: “Building on our experience valuing education outcomes through a social impact bond in India, we are excited to be working with OutcomesX to fund social outcomes. We believe that outcomes marketplaces have the potential to break down some of the barriers to funding grassroots NGOs and help scale their impact.”OutcomesX recruited 63 nonprofits working on two outcomes that UBS Optimus Foundation sought for Ukrainian children: improved learning and improved mental health. Recruited NGOs uploaded their data and cost information into a tool called the Impact Genome Registry . The registry rates the quality of a nonprofit’s data based on rigor of collection method (whether anecdotal, point in time, pre-post action assessments, or a full blown randomized controlled trial); relevance to the outcome (such as whether the data related to the specified outcomes); and validity (how closely the approach corresponds to methods proving their merit elsewhere).Said Olga Tsipan, head of the community-based Center for Child Development Erudit in Berezne, Ukraine: “The social outcomes marketplace enables us to upload proof of outcomes in mental health that we are achieving for children, amid war, and thus become eligible to meet and sell those outcomes to global donors. We as a community-based nonprofit never would have been able to reach donors abroad who care about Ukrainian children's well-being without coming to a marketplace. This is a game changer for us as it changes the way we fundraise and helps organizations on the ground make a big difference.”To move relief dollars fast, the marketplace is up and running with manual trades, and automation is around the corner to pave the way to cutting red tape throughout the international aid system and democratizing relief funding. Any funder of any size can buy verified outcomes, and any nonprofit with proof of outcomes can sell their service delivery and access liquidity.Said Jason Saul, cofounder and CEO of OutcomesX: “The process of applying for funding is so complicated and time-consuming that local Ukrainian NGOs can’t access the money they desperately need, more than a dozen Ukrainian aid workers told The New Humanitarian.

That’s according to a recent report from UBS, which found that store closures in 2023 are already up significantly compared to the prior year. In the last few months, various retailers have announced plans to consolidate their store bases and close stores. Foot Locker last month announced a decision to close more than 400 stores locations through 2026 focus on higher-performing doors. Walmart also recently announced a plan to close seven underperforming stores, including its last two pickup and delivery concept locations.

By the end of 2027, UBS estimates that about 50,000 stores will close across the current U.S. store count of about 940,000 stores, meaning there would be less than 5 percent fewer stores by the end of 2027.

Retailers have announced about 2,600 store closures and 5,100 store openings for the year, according to Coresight Research cited in BDO’s bi-annual bankruptcy report. Store openings this year have been mainly led by dollar store and discount chains, which have benefitted from cost-cutting consumers.

As for the reasons for the predicted closures, UBS outlined a few key factors. For starters, the cost to run a store is going up, especially as wages increase and rents stay high. At the same time, a general slowdown in consumer spending, less available credit and e-commerce growth are also to blame.

UBS predicts e-commerce penetration to grow from its current 20 percent to 26 percent by 2027, with 25 percent of online sales being fulfilled from stores. This model also assumes that retail sales grow 4 percent annually.

The National Retail Federation forecast that retail sales will grow between 4 percent and 6 percent in 2023, with sales reaching between $5.13 trillion and $5.23 trillion this year. While NRF has said a recession is unlikely in 2023, a recession could result in even more store closures, UBS said.

The stores at risk of closures are those of smaller chains, department stores and specialty retailers with mainly discretionary items.

“In our view, these smaller chains and mom and pops are most at risk of closures given these firms typically have less access to capital needed to invest in developing a robust omnichannel offering,” UBS analysts wrote in the report.

Meanwhile, off-price retailers and dollar stores are set to continue to grow their presence as they resonate with cost-conscious consumers.

Like store closures, retail bankruptcies are set to come back into play in a big way in 2023 after a relatively slow year in 2022. Between the start of 2023 through the end of February, six major retailers filed for bankruptcy, according to BDO’s bi-annual bankruptcy report. That’s more than the total number of retail bankruptcies in 2022.

In some cases, these bankruptcies could correlate with store closures for chains as well.","['Shoshy Ciment', 'More Stories Shoshy', 'View All']",2023-04-11 19:30:32+00:00

Synder said while the market’s valuation of GE’s GE, +1.21% stock may be “pushing near the upper limit,” his chief concern is geopolitical, not macroeconomic.

“[GE’s] exposure is defensive and well positioned for the macro at hand with each business line seeing low-risk [positive] rate of change, into both 2023 [and] 2024,” Snyder wrote in a note to clients.

He reiterated the buy rating he’s had on GE’s stock for at least three years while lifting his price target to $109 from $95. The stock hasn’t closed at or above $109 since January 2018.

The stock rose 0.2% to close at $94.30, with Snyder’s new price target implying further 15.6% upside. It has slipped 2.7% since closing at a five-year high of $96.92 on April 3.

Synder said his new price target includes a $94-per-share valuation for GE’s aviation business and a $16-per-share valuation for GE Vernova, which includes the company’s power and renewable-energy businesses.

GE Vernova is expected to separate from GE in early 2024, which would leave GE operating as GE Aerospace. GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. GEHC, -0.69% separated from GE in January 2023.

GE is scheduled to report first-quarter results on April 25 before the opening bell. Since the end of January, after the separation of GE HealthCare, the average analyst estimate compiled by FactSet for earnings per share has increased to 14 cents from 13 cents, while the FactSet revenue consensus has slipped to $13.25 billion from $13.35 billion.

Of the 21 analysts surveyed by FactSet who cover GE, 14 are bullish and seven are neutral, and the average stock-price target is $101.17. Snyder’s new price target makes him the fourth most bullish on the stock.",['Tomi Kilgore'],

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/swiss-lawmakers-open-session-looking-at-ubs-credit-suisse-deal-63d064b9,Swiss lawmakers open session looking at UBS-Credit Suisse deal,"GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland’s parliament is opening a special session Tuesday to scrutinize the state-imposed takeover of Swiss bank Credit Suisse by rival UBS — and possibly considering strengthening the legal arsenal to better gird against financial blowups.

The debate could run up to three days, with expectations that lawmakers will voice — and need to iron out — disagreements over the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.25 billion) fusion of the country’s top two banks, a thunderclap for a country that prides itself on finesse and acumen in finance.

Swiss authorities stepped in as shares of Credit Suisse CSGN, -1.22% CS, +1.05% and other banks plunged last month after the failure of two U.S. banks sparked concerns about other potentially shaky institutions in the global financial system. Credit Suisse is among 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

Lawmakers were expected to raise concerns about thousands of expected job cuts, discuss possible strengthening of banking laws and accountability for long-troubled Credit Suisse, and look at state-backed guarantees of over $100 billion aimed both at holding the bank together until the merger is completed and buttressing UBS UBSG, -1.39% UBS, +1.29% against possible losses as it combines with its rival.

They also were likely to consider what it will mean that Switzerland is set to have one giant bank.

Despite the talk, few concrete results were expected from the session, which is primarily expected to flesh out ideas — and possibly some vitriol — from lawmakers who all face reelection this fall.

Yvan Lengwiler, an economics professor at the University of Basel, suggested that the debate would play into a longtime “tug-of-war” between lawmakers who have lobbied in favor of Swiss banks over the years and others who have long sought to stiffen regulation.

“It seems that the pendulum, after this debacle we’ve seen, has clearly shifted towards strengthening,” he said. “Two years from now … the political situation might be very different, and it could be quite difficult to get this through parliament.”",['Associated Press'],

A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.

Barclays will follow Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in cutting more than 100 investment banking jobs, it is understood.

The London-based bank is set to axe jobs in wake of the industry slowdown in deals and IPOs, according to Sky News’ Mark Kleinman.

It has been reported the layoffs will be spread across multiple countries and across the bank, in a cost-saving exercise.

This comes after Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have cut more than 1,000 jobs already this year, while Barclays has axed around 200 in its investment arm, it was reported last November.

Last week it was reported that the total number of bids for UK firms fell by over a quarter on the same period last year with just 11 new firm offers made to buy UK listed companies, according to data from broker and investment bank Peel Hunt.

Meanwhile, London managed only five IPOs in the first quarter of 2023, raising just £81m as the City’s flagship exchange struggles to attract new participants.

The main market saw only two IPOs, from Dar Global and Streaks Gaming. The two IPOs raised a combined £63m, with £60m of that coming from luxury real estate firm Dar Global.

Barclays’ latest round of redundancies have taken place despite soaring interest rates leading to banks cashing in.

On Friday, JP Morgan Chase reported its profits were up 52 per cent, while Wells Fargo and Citi both exceeded expectations.

Last month, the banking sector was rocked by a near-crisis with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and Credit Suisse, which was bought by UBS.

Barclays has been approached for comment about the job cuts.

https://news.yahoo.com/bruce-springsteen-day-officially-recognized-003300600.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,‘Bruce Springsteen Day’ to be officially recognized in New Jersey,"Bruce Springsteen is getting his own glory day in his native New Jersey.

Sept. 23, the rocker’s birthday, will be officially recognized in the state as “Bruce Springsteen Day,” Gov. Phil Murphy announced.

“Bruce Springsteen is one of the most iconic and influential musicians — and New Jerseyans — of all time, period,” tweeted Murphy, who said he is “honored and proud” to make the declaration.

Born in Long Branch and raised in Freehold, the 73-year-old Springsteen is a 20-time Grammy winner whose hit songs include “Born to Run,” “Born in the U.S.A.,” “Glory Days” and “Dancing in the Dark.”

“Bruce Springsteen will forever be remembered as the voice of the Garden State, signaling to the world that New Jerseyans were born to run,” reads an official decree shared by the governor.

Murphy first made the “Bruce Springsteen Day” announcement during Saturday night’s first-ever American Music Honors, which Springsteen and wife Patti Scialfa missed after testing positive for COVID-19, according to the Asbury Park Press.

The Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music says it organized the American Music Honors to recognize the artistry, integrity and commitment of select musicians. Steven Van Zandt, Darlene Love, Sam Moore and Steve Earle were honored at Saturday’s ceremony.

Springsteen and the E Street Band are in the midst of their 2023 world tour, recently performing at Madison Square Garden, the Barclays Center, UBS Arena in Elmont, N.Y., and the Prudential Center in Newark.

The Boss and his band also have concerts scheduled for Sept. 1 and Sept. 3 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.","['Peter Sblendorio', 'New York Daily News']",

Analyst Price Forecast Suggests 3.03% Downside

As of April 6, 2023, the average one-year price target for Kimberly-Clark is $131.55. The forecasts range from a low of $119.18 to a high of $150.15. The average price target represents a decrease of 3.03% from its latest reported closing price of $135.66.

See our leaderboard of companies with the largest price target upside.

The projected annual revenue for Kimberly-Clark is $20,309MM, an increase of 0.66%. The projected annual non-GAAP EPS is $6.40.

Kimberly-Clark Declares $1.18 Dividend

On January 25, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.18 per share ($4.72 annualized). Shareholders of record as of March 10, 2023 received the payment on April 4, 2023. Previously, the company paid $1.16 per share.

At the current share price of $135.66 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 3.48%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 3.37%, the lowest has been 2.71%, and the highest has been 4.21%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.30 (n=236).

The current dividend yield is 0.37 standard deviations above the historical average.

Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.82. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.

The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.10%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time.

https://www.thewestonforum.com/only-ubs-cs-puk-can-bring-light-into-the-darkness/,Only UBS/CS-PUK can bring light into the darkness,"One of the main issues after UBS’ acquisition of CS is the question of what CS is still worth. and how the CS condition will affect UBS. If the public knew more about it, a problem of too big to fail could be discussed more seriously. UBS is currently in the process of finding answers quickly with internal and possibly external inspection bodies as well. You don’t hear about it in public.

One of the focal points is the evaluation of derivatives in which CS is involved. Infosperber has pointed out the importance of these papers in a series of articles. According to finance professor Mark Chesney, the face value of derivatives at Credit Suisse in 2017 was CHF 29.9 trillion. This figure exceeded the GDP of Switzerland by a factor of 36.

This value or exclusion of CS derivatives is one of the main risks that the Federal Government has to cover with the state guarantee of CHF 109 billion. It is not known to what extent federal agencies have secured CS screening insight.

Analysis is a daunting task. In the 2008 Wall Street crisis, the US authorities had to do the analytical work Black stone You must consult, today’s largest financial group in the world. It was only with the help of the major Black Rock bands that the US authorities were able to come up with bailout plans for the failed investment banks. Bear Stearns And Citigroup and a financial insurance giant AIG To engrave.

Big banks speculate highly abstract products in the billions. Transactions are very complex and require sophisticated computing power. But it is largely opaque. Major banks have outsourced a large portion of their derivatives trading to shadow banks that venture outside national and international regulations. If the bank goes into sharp decline, the state steps in.

Banking incidents have always been found somehow resolved over the past 70 years. But at what cost? The last super crash in 2008 led to major social unrest. Many countries still suffer from it.

PUK now

In Switzerland, politics and business are now wondering if the new UBS will not overwhelm the country. Helplessness reads between the lines and can also be seen on TV. This brings us to the question of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.

Yes, it needs a PUK. She must dissect CS like the corpse of a drowned man to find out how the mysterious deals were going. Especially with derivatives. And in proprietary CS trading. The PUK must have access to the results of the ongoing analysis by UBS. The PUK must conduct its investigations yet to be able to provide information to the public about whether the extravagantly speculative deals had any economic benefit at all. Or whether the majority of derivatives transactions – which is already evident – benefit only bonus recipients and shareholders.

More urgent is the question of what a (big) bank should look like in order for the state to free it from all-encompassing responsibility.

The banking lobby is sharpening its knives

The banking lobby is already heating up the old argument about competitive disadvantage and bringing it to the people. Strict regulations would hurt the Swiss financial position. Other banks and and and and will be affected. Just like after 2008 in the USA, Great Britain, France or Germany, when caring politicians (Merkel was there too) let themselves be afraid and fear for their banking positions.

One of the lobby’s nicest examples of this is the Hole Out Works by Dodd-Frank from 2010 by major US banks. New regulations should make “too big to fail” impossible in the future. president c. B. Morgan Chase He personally contacted more than a dozen members of Congress to provide the required countermeasures. And Citicorp He rewrote an important passage of the supposed Wall Street legislation himself. This is after the bank received $50 billion in bailout funds in the storm.

Also in European Union Fifteen years ago, hundreds of billions of tax dollars were poured into bailouts of troubled banks. In contrast, their speculative transactions should be highly restricted and taxed by law. But the financial lobby largely blocked the project – thanks to the International Banking Association IIF, headed by the Swiss Joseph Ackerman.

Was the situation different in Switzerland until now? no. Parliamentary transcripts of relevant debates in recent years can be read. Reading is particularly awkward for FDP. Current contact distortions fit this. The motto: “Wait and see if you can and don’t rush anything.”

Swiss bank lobby can be happy.",['Faye Stephens'],2023-04-15 04:44:21+00:00

“Our approach is to stay agile,” TCS management told CNBC-TV18 in an exclusive interaction and added that uncertainty is still lingering and likely to be there for some time. Customers are prioritising some spends over others.

Speaking of specifics, they said manufacturing and auto sectors have seen discretionary projects being put on hold. BFSI is also seeing caution where clients want to spend wisely, outgoing CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said.

""We are not seeing any deal cancellations. Budgets are largely intact and clients want to spend wisely and be cautious for a few weeks,” he added.

K Krithivasan, who takes over as CEO on June 1, said that some discretionary work may be deferred or cancelled by Credit Suisse as merger with UBS progresses.

“Customers are likely to prioritise certain kinds of projects over others – defer and not cancel. Our thesis is technology spend is quite resilient and customers need that to remain competitive in the marketplace. So, they cannot say that I will not do these kinds of projects; they have to do those projects, they may defer.”

He explained that projects with long return on assets (ROA) timelines are the ones that typically get held. ""Would you call cloud a discretionary project or a non-discretionary? We keep signing cloud deals and cloud deals keep going on. So, each bank and each institution’s situation vary. It depends on where they think there is an immediate opportunity,” he said.

TCS management's remarks come a day after India's largest IT services exporter reported a five percent sequential increase in March quarter net profit to Rs 11,392 crore while the firm flagged worries from its key market of North America.

Events like the fall of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and fears of a contagion have impacted client sentiments in North America and the banking, financial services and insurance sector in particular, leading to clients deferring spends, the Tata Group company said.

The company reported revenue growth of 0.6 percent in constant currency terms, which was the slowest since the April-June period of financial year 2021, which is the quarter in which the pandemic hit. Gopinathan conceded that the growth in the topline over the December quarter has been ""weaker than anticipated"" because of the setbacks in North America.

He said the ""negative"" sentiment has led to a situation where discretionary spends are being put on hold by clients, and added that it is ""wait and watch"" in the immediate near-term for them. There have been no project cancellations and the structural story of Indian IT is intact, he added.

Procter & Gamble Declares $0.91 Dividend

On January 10, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.91 per share ($3.65 annualized). Shareholders of record as of January 20, 2023 received the payment on February 15, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.91 per share.

At the current share price of $151.26 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 2.42%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 2.66%, the lowest has been 2.14%, and the highest has been 3.99%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.42 (n=237).

The current dividend yield is 0.57 standard deviations below the historical average.

Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.60. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.

The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.22%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time.

Analyst Price Forecast Suggests 5.88% Upside

As of April 6, 2023, the average one-year price target for PepsiCo is $194.44. The forecasts range from a low of $176.75 to a high of $224.28. The average price target represents an increase of 5.88% from its latest reported closing price of $183.64.

See our leaderboard of companies with the largest price target upside.

The projected annual revenue for PepsiCo is $88,791MM, an increase of 2.78%. The projected annual non-GAAP EPS is $7.36.

PepsiCo Declares $1.15 Dividend

On February 1, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share ($4.60 annualized). Shareholders of record as of March 3, 2023 received the payment on March 31, 2023. Previously, the company paid $1.15 per share.

At the current share price of $183.64 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 2.50%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 2.92%, the lowest has been 2.47%, and the highest has been 3.82%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.28 (n=236).

The current dividend yield is 1.51 standard deviations below the historical average.

Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.80. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.

The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.36%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time.

Analyst sees GE as a defensive play amid increasing concerns about economic growth

Shares of General Electric Co. gained ground Thursday after bullish UBS analyst Chris Snyder raised his price target by 15%, saying the aviation, power and renewable-energy company is a defensive play in the face of a worrisome economic outlook.

Synder said while the market's valuation of GE's (GE) stock may be ""pushing near the upper limit,"" his chief concern is geopolitical, not macroeconomic.

""[GE's] exposure is defensive and well positioned for the macro at hand with each business line seeing low-risk [positive] rate of change, into both 2023 [and] 2024,"" Snyder wrote in a note to clients.

He reiterated the buy rating he's had on GE's stock for at least three years while lifting his price target to $109 from $95. The stock hasn't closed at or above $109 since January 2018.

The stock rose 0.2% to close at $94.30, with Snyder's new price target implying further 15.6% upside. It has slipped 2.7% since closing at a five-year high of $96.92 on April 3.

Synder said his new price target includes a $94-per-share valuation for GE's aviation business and a $16-per-share valuation for GE Vernova, which includes the company's power and renewable-energy businesses.

GE Vernova is expected to separate from GE in early 2024, which would leave GE operating as GE Aerospace. GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (GEHC)separated from GE in January 2023.

GE is scheduled to report first-quarter results on April 25 before the opening bell. Since the end of January, after the separation of GE HealthCare, the average analyst estimate compiled by FactSet for earnings per share has increased to 14 cents from 13 cents, while the FactSet revenue consensus has slipped to $13.25 billion from $13.35 billion.

Of the 21 analysts surveyed by FactSet who cover GE, 14 are bullish and seven are neutral, and the average stock-price target is $101.17. Snyder's new price target makes him the fourth most bullish on the stock.

GE shares have run up 17.2% since the end of January, while the S&P 500 has advanced 1.7%.

https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/us-fed-approves-ubs-credit-suisse-merger-11681518221148.html,US Fed approves UBS-Credit Suisse merger. Details here,"UBS-Credit Suisse merger: The Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve has given its approval to the UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse Bank deal. The US Fed informed about the development and said that it has given its approval to the UBS-Credit Suisse deal for acquisition of the US subsidiaries of Credit Suisse by UBS Group AG. The US Fed went on to add that the UBS Group had sought its approval to the deal on March 22.

In this Swiss-brokered rescue deal, the US Fed' board of Governors said, the UBS Group AG has committed to give an implementation plan to the the US Federal Reserve for amalgamation of its American operations and business with Credit Suisse subsidiaries within three months of consummating the UBS-Credit Suisse deal.

This UBS-Credit Suisse investment banking deal will include more strong measures including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution, the US Fed added.

As per the banks merger and acquisition law in the US, the US Federal Reserve is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

UBS-Credit Suisse deal — explained

The 167-year-old Credit Suisse Bank came to the brink of collapse before Zurich-based rival UBS rode to the rescue with a merger engineered and bankrolled by the Swiss authorities last month. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

The Swiss authorities and UBS Group AG have been racing to close the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG within as little as a month, in an effort to retain the lender's clients and employees, Reuters previously reported.

UBS secured a temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, people familiar with the process told Reuters.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Under the Credit Suisse UBS merger deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

https://www.finews.com/news/english-news/56833-karin-keller-sutter-ubs-credit-suissedeal,Is the UBS-Credit Suisse Deal on the Brink of Collapse?,"Emergency law was used to push through the Credit Suisse takeover by UBS, with subsequent approval by the Federal Assembly as merely a formality according to the Swiss Finance Minister. Legal experts see otherwise.

After the Swiss federal government came to the rescue of Credit Suisse with a forced takeover by UBS, Swiss Federal Councillor and Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said billions of government funds granted through emergency legislation were «fully committed.» By taking that route, approval through an extraordinary session of parliament was to have been a formality.

Legal experts disagree. Articles 28 and 34 of the Financial Budget Act stipulate that «urgent» credits require not only prior approval of the finance delegation but also that of parliament, as reported by the «Blick am Sonntag» (in German) over the weekend.

The word «approval» is crucial, says University of Fribourg constitutional law professor Andreas Stoeckli, «It means that the parliament's decision has legally binding force.»

Legal Obligations

Bernhard Ruetsche, professor of public law at the University of Lucerne, agrees. In the context of the genesis of federal law, from the wording «subsequent approval,» it can be concluded, «that urgent commitment credits decided by the Federal Council with the approval of the finance delegation lose their legal validity if not approved by the Federal Assembly.»

Still, according to Ruetsche, legal obligations entered into by the Federal Council before non-approval by parliament remain in place due to the protection of legitimate expectations and legal clarity. The question is whether or not such obligations exist.

Tricky Situation

A default guarantee exists for the liquidity support from the SNB, goes the argument of the Federal Department of Finance (FDF). The situation is different for the loss protection for UBS in the amount of nine billion, which has not yet been contractually set. Stoeckli says that «Written form is a prerequisite for the guarantee of a contract. The relevant article in the emergency decree is not an obligation, but merely an authorization.»

He also says not all the essential points of the guarantee are contained there. Whether or not the Federal Council's declarations of intent have legal consequences for the federal government must be clarified in detail, Stoeckli said. It's a tricky situation because the deal could fall through if the Federal Council does not sign the contract. «But it is doubtful whether the Federal Council will be allowed to sign the contract at all after the parliament's 'no' vote.»

UBS declined to comment on whether it would seek to claim damages if there is no contract. Meanwhile, the FDF maintains that «the rejection has no impact on the guarantees.»

One National Councilor said that if the Finance Department's interpretation does not pass legal muster, «this is a scandal in terms of national policy» and if true, «Keller-Sutter must resign.»",[],2023-04-17 06:22:50

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

DAVE BRIGGS: All right, it's time now for Triple Play, three stocks we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading-- Dish Network, Rivian, and Meta. We'll start things off with my play, which is Dish Network. Shares slumping to close the week on a downgrade from UBS. Analyst John Hodulik cutting his rating to neutral from buy, slashing his price target, though, to 10 bucks from 27. Hodulik writing in a note, quote, ""We now factor higher wireless dilution amid Dish's entry into postpaid wireless""-- that's later this year.

The analyst also citing a cybersecurity incident, which resulted in data being extracted, impacted call centers and online channels for not just a couple of days-- for several weeks. In fact, reports circulated that customers spent hours and hours on hold and were even warned of a 10 to 15-hour wait time, again, weeks after the cyber attack took place.

Let's check out the stock, how far it's fallen today. It's been a rough year as well for Dish Network. Falling on the year, falling in the last 12 months, 3/4 of their market cap wiped out. It is a rough time-- double downgrade from Bank of America. It feels like a very rough outlook. I can't imagine what the catalyst could be for Dish.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I mean, rough days for Dish. I mean, all the satellite broadcasters, right? It's just really rough times. You know, I think Charlie Ergen, the CEO, the wily Charlie Ergen talking about retransmission fee is going to go down, down, down. That's the trend. He's been angling for a DirecTV merger, Dish and DirecTV merger. That's what he wants. So we'll see if that happens. But that's rough times. A 10 to 15-hour wait time-- what?

DAVE BRIGGS: 10 to 15 hours, weeks after the cyber attack took place. And yes, slowing subscriber growth. It feels like an industry turnaround just isn't possible at this point, given all the trends we're seeing in the media environment.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, maybe they focus more on the internet broadcast stuff. So we'll see.",[],
https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-invest-inflation-recession-economy-outlook-goldman-sachs-ubs-2023-4,Goldman Sachs and UBS warn that lower inflation won't be enough to make stocks rally — but these 7 investments can help investors earn a profit anyway,"Investors have mostly yawned at lower inflation data this week, keeping stocks range-bound.

Strategists at the asset management arms of Goldman Sachs and UBS are signaling caution.

Here are seven ways to invest while the economy continues to weaken.

Inflation is steadily falling. In fact, it came in below consensus expectations last month, according to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) reports released this week.

A few months ago, that news likely would have sent stocks soaring. But the S&P 500 didn't really respond to March inflation data. Instead, it continued its nearly two-week-long streak of sessions in which it closed within 1% of its prior level.

The message from markets is clear: lower inflation isn't necessarily a green light for stocks.

Strategists at UBS Global Wealth Management (GWM) and Goldman Sachs Asset Management issued even sterner warnings, with neither seeing much upside for stocks in the foreseeable future.

""Our view is that equity risk is not properly priced to make a long position compelling,"" said Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, the co-head of portfolio management for multi-asset solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in commentary sent via email on April 12.

Stocks will struggle if lower inflation doesn't change the Fed's mind

Interest rates have arguably been the biggest driver of US stocks in the last three years, as near-zero rates sent the S&P 500 soaring before a sudden spike in rates led to a sharp selloff. Until the Fed pauses or reverses its rate hikes, many strategists refuse to recommend stocks.

Wall Street agrees that the US central bank is near the end of its rate-hiking cycle, but there's still disagreement as to when the final hike will be, assuming it wasn't last month. There's also no overwhelming consensus about whether the Fed will end up lowering rates later this year.

Wilson-Elizondo and her colleagues at Goldman Sachs Asset Management think there's a good chance of another small rate hike in May, though she noted that tighter credit conditions and the possibility of lingering stress in the banking sector mean it's no guarantee.

Top minds at UBS GWM also expect another hike in May, and even though the economy is losing steam, they're not counting on a rate cut in 2023. Mark Haefele, the firm's chief investment officer, noted that weaker growth and high rates is a bad combination for stocks.

""With the US economy cooling and a Fed pivot not imminent, we believe the environment for equities will remain challenging in the coming months,"" Haefele wrote in an April 13 note.

Jason Draho, the head of asset allocation for the Americas at UBS GWM, seconded Haefele's May rate hike prediction — and his cautious sentiment — in a recent interview with Insider.

The market's main focus has shifted from inflation to growth in recent weeks, Draho noted. But the Fed's top priority still seems to be getting price growth under control by raising interest rates, even though the Fed's own economists just acknowledged that a recession is likely coming later this year.

Given the Fed's strong anti-inflation stance, lower rates could actually mean that stocks are in trouble, Draho said. He argued that the Fed is unlikely to cut rates unless the economy falters.

""If they do cut, then it's probably because things have really deteriorated, and then they might actually cut — if not by the end of this year, early next year — by a decent amount,"" Draho said. ""But I'd say that's more of the bear case as opposed to the base case.""

7 ways to invest right now

Two weeks of flat, directionless trading for US stocks could go on for another month or two, Draho said. He added that he's not surprised markets didn't rally off of the latest inflation data.

""It's good news,"" Draho said of the March CPI report. ""But there's a lot of good news already priced into equity markets.""

Draho thinks that right now stocks look like a shaky bet, since the S&P 500's earnings multiple is rather expensive relative to history at around 18.5x. And while the asset allocation head does expect solid earnings, he doesn't think rates will let stocks command such a high multiple.

""I think equity markets are too optimistic,"" Draho said. ""So the way we frame it is that, if you buy equities at this level between now and year-end, you're getting sort of a lot of return-less risk — so a lot of volatility without a lot of return.""

However, opportunities remain for investors. Draho listed seven types of investments that he likes right now: US Treasuries, high-quality corporate bonds, and longer-duration bonds, as well as stocks in emerging markets and the industrials, consumer staples, and utilities sectors.

If the economy weakens, it could be worthwhile to hide out in fixed income. Investors should focus on safety and quality right now through low-risk investments like Treasuries, Draho said, even if it means sacrificing yield. Those looking for slightly better returns can consider high-quality agency mortgage-backed securities, Draho added.

Assuming that interest rates don't rise much further, longer-duration bonds are also a good bet, according to UBS. Goldman Sachs Asset Management is also bullish on long-duration assets while the economy weakens, especially compared to riskier high-yield bonds.

While UBS recommends an underweight position in stocks relative to fixed income, Draho said both economically sensitive and defensive companies can work in portfolios.

Stocks in emerging markets will benefit from China's nascent economic recovery, Draho said, adding that improved earnings and a falling dollar will also be tailwinds for the group.

""Our expectations for earnings growth in EM are higher than they are in the US,"" Draho said. He also likes industrials since they're closely tied to global growth, which he's more optimistic about than that of the US.

Lastly, Draho and his colleagues advise bracing against weaker growth in a late-cycle economy by targeting defensive sectors like consumer staples and utilities.

""They're classic defensive sectors that are not particularly expensive on a relative basis,"" Draho said of stocks in staples and utilities. ""They're kind of at long-term averages. Where if you think you're going to go into a recession and if you're worried about them being expensive, that's not necessarily the case right now.""",['James Faris'],2023-04-14 00:00:00
https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/our-approach/marketnews/article.1589190.html,US earnings have yet to reflect underlying headwinds,"The S&P 500 closed 0.2% lower on Friday amid signs the economy is slowing, with US retail sales for March declining slightly more than consensus expectations. Still, markets appear to read it as insufficient to deter a Fed rate hike in May. US 2-year Treasury yields were up 12 basis points, the US dollar index partially trimmed its weekly losses to 0.5%, and money markets firmed expectations for a 25 basis point hike.

So far, early results and guidance from companies whose fiscal quarter ended in February have been encouraging, beating earnings estimates by 6% compared with 3% in recent quarters, despite concerns that the recent tightening in credit conditions could weigh on corporate profits. Top US lender JP Morgan on Friday beat consensus first quarter earnings estimates, sending the S&P financials subindex up 1%.

Early earnings results appear in line with our expectations that 1Q S&P 500 EPS may be surprisingly resilient: the impact from credit tightening should take time to show up in corporate fundamentals, consumer spending has remained supported by a still-healthy jobs market and excess household savings, and supply chains have also continued to improve, helping to lower costs. Finally, the “bar” for earnings season seems low. The 1Q23 bottom-up estimate for the S&P 500 has fallen by 6.5% over the last three months.

But while the upcoming earnings season may not weigh on market sentiment, we still see reasons for investors to remain cautious on US equities this year.

Tighter lending standards look set to weigh on earnings. Credit conditions were already tightening even before the banking sector turmoil in March. The January 2023 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS) showed that a net 45% of banks tightened lending standards for large- and medium-sized firms. The only other times when credit was this tight were during the COVID-19 pandemic, the global financial crisis, and the dotcom bust. We consider bank lending to be the lifeline of the economy. If credit standards remain this tight or get more restrictive, profit growth should likely continue to come under pressure.

Inflation is still too far above target for the Fed to consider rate cuts for now. Although inflation is cooling, it remains too high, in our view. We think the Fed has more work to do to get inflation back down to its 2% target. And with the labor market still reasonably strong, we are skeptical that the Fed will be able to cut interest rates this year. Historically, the Fed has not cut rates when unemployment has been this low. As a result, we think the Fed will likely need to keep monetary policy restrictive, forestalling any reacceleration in economic growth that could reignite inflation.

Full year consensus earnings estimates are too high, and valuations are still expensive. We think that consensus expectations for a reacceleration in S&P 500 earnings growth and margins are unlikely. We expect S&P 500 EPS to contract 4.5% in 2023 before expanding 9.5% in 2024, which are about 5% below bottom-up consensus estimates. Also, even if the S&P 500 constituents beat earnings by 3–5%, that would still translate into a decline of 1–3% relative to the same period last year.

Furthermore, valuations are expensive. The S&P 500 forward P/E of 18X is still near its highest level in a year and above pre-pandemic levels. Historically, these levels would be consistent with robust consensus earnings growth expectations of 14% on average (compared to current 4%) and/or 10-year Treasury yields less than 2% (vs the current 3.52%). This suggests that valuations may be too optimistic.

So, we remain least preferred on US equities and recommend investors diversify beyond the US and growth stocks. On the other hand, we are most preferred on emerging market equities where we expect the MSCI EM index to deliver low-teens percentage returns this year, thanks to strong earnings growth, China’s economic recovery and relatively cheap valuations. Within emerging markets, two of our preferred areas are Chinese equities and Asian semiconductors.",[],
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/credit-suisse-fund-outflows-widen-to-5-6-billion-following-ubs-tie-up-36297874,Credit Suisse fund outflows widen to $5.6 billion following UBS tie-up,"Outflows from Credit Suisse branded investment funds have accelerated in the weeks since its historic merger with Swiss rival UBS, as investors continue to redeem billions of dollars.

Data provided to Financial News by Morningstar shows net outflows from around 300 EU and US domiciled Credit Suisse CSGN, -1.33% CS, +1.05% funds have reached $5.6 billion over the three weeks since the tie-up.

The latest outflows will pile pressure on the merged firm; investors had already pulled around $3 billion from Credit Suisse funds in the week surrounding the shotgun wedding.

The latest figures show an additional $2.5 billion of net outflows from Credit Suisse funds between March 23 and April 6.

“It is fair to say that there is still uncertainty around the deal and the potential impact that it may have on Credit Suisse Asset Management,” Johann Scholtz, an equity analyst at Morningstar told FN.

Heavy outflows from Credit Suisse funds began on March 14, the day the bank said it had discovered “material weaknesses” in its financial reporting controls.

Credit Suisse declined to comment.

The largest daily outflows remain those recorded on March 21 — two days after the landmark deal was announced — when $776 million was pulled from Credit Suisse’s European funds.

Despite the steady outflows in recent weeks, the Morningstar figures show Credit Suisse’s European funds posted net inflows of more than $240 million over April 5 and April 6 — an early indication that investor jitters are starting to subside.

The flows data does not include all the asset manager’s funds in Europe and the U,S,, and represents only those funds that report daily figures to Morningstar.

Laith Khalaf, head of investments at online platform AJ Bell, said the bulk of fund outflows in the days surrounding the tie-up with UBS UBSG, -1.52% UBS, +1.29% was likely driven by investors worried about the stability of Credit Suisse and those spooked by wider banking sector turmoil.

“Those assets should be ring-fenced in the event of an insolvency, but investors might have decided that a belt-and-braces approach was required given the febrile market conditions at the time,” he said.

The $3.25 billion tie-up between UBS and Credit Suisse — the biggest merger between two systematically integral banks since the 2008 global financial crisis — also combined the banks’ respective asset management units, creating Europe’s largest money manager with $1.5 trillion.

UBS announced on March 29 that former boss Sergio Ermotti would return to oversee the merger. Ermotti, who stepped down as UBS chief in 2020 after nine years in the role, took over from Ralph Hamers at the start of April.

Analysts told FN last month that Ermotti would likely face significant challenges bringing together the two management arms, citing differences in corporate cultures, overlapping product ranges and technology issues.

Scholtz said some outflows in recent weeks may have been driven by Credit Suisse’s wealth management clients moving to other firms to “lower their concentration risk” if they are already using similar wealth products and services offered by UBS.

Similarly, some institutional investors with allocation to Credit Suisse funds may want to diversify if they are also UBS Asset Management clients, he said.

Ermotti has resigned as chairman of Swiss Re, leaving vice-chair Jacques de Vaucleroy to manage the reinsurer’s transition and succession processes.

Ermotti originally left UBS in October 2020 and was succeeded by Ralph Hamers, previously CEO of ING Group. UBS said in a statement that Hamers had agreed to step down as CEO “to serve the interests of the new combination”. He will remain at the bank during the transition period as an adviser.

Citi has appointed 32-year veteran Anand Selva as its chief operating officer. Selva was previously Citi’s head of personal banking and wealth management and will continue to oversee these divisions.

Way, who has been with Citi for two decades, will become part of the executive committee of its banking, capital markets and advisory business in the UK and Ireland.

Bank of America has promoted Lindsay Hans and Eric Schimpf as presidents and co-heads of Merrill Wealth Management. Hans previously served for six years as a regional division executive. Schimpf spent six years at the division-executive. Both will report to Bank of America chair and CEO Brian Moynihan. The appointments follow the announcement of Andy Sieg’s impending departure for Citi (see above).

James Robertson and Peter Luck have been appointed to lead Bank of America’s UK investment bank in newly created roles. Robertson joins after 22 years at UBS, most recently leading its UK advisory business. Luck is currently Bank of America Securities’ head of corporate broking and will retain these responsibilities alongside his new role.

By Hannah Lang, Chris Prentice and Ann Saphir

April 14 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's Board of Governors on Friday said it has approved UBS Group AG's acquisition of the U.S. subsidiaries of Credit Suisse, clearing another major hurdle for the completion of the Swiss-brokered rescue deal.

UBS has committed to give the U.S. central bank an implementation plan for combining its U.S. business and operations with those of Credit Suisse within three months of consummating the deal, the Fed's Board said in a statement. The plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution, the statement said.

The U.S. central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

After years of scandal and losses, 167-year-old Credit Suisse came to the brink of collapse before Zurich-based rival UBS rode to the rescue with a merger engineered and bankrolled by the Swiss authorities last month. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

The Swiss authorities and UBS Group AG have been racing to close the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG within as little as a month, in an effort to retain the lender's clients and employees, Reuters previously reported.

UBS secured a temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, people familiar with the process told Reuters.

Story continues

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

The Fed subjects firms with more than $700 billion in assets, or more than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activities, to heightened supervision, including annual company-run stress tests and increased liquidity standards.

As the laggard within the group in terms of transition pace, Japan is relying on technologies such as carbon capture and ammonia to extend the use of existing gas or coal power plants instead of pivoting quickly to renewable energy sources.

While both of these alternatives are exciting, and can leverage existing power infrastructure, their effectiveness to reliably reduce carbon emissions at scale have yet to be proven.

The disagreement underlines that G7 members still have plenty of areas to align on in the fight against climate change, but recent developments in the clean energy space provide encouraging momentum.

Solar and wind hit record global power generation in 2022. Wind and solar energy represented a record 12% of global electricity generation last year, up from 10% in 2021, according to a report published by climate and energy think tank Ember last week. With power sector data from 78 countries, or 93% of global power demand, Ember said 2022 could have marked peak emissions from the power sector, which is the largest source of carbon dioxide worldwide. In addition, the growth in wind and solar in 2022 met 80% of the rise in global electricity demand.

The development in clean energy sources means that the peak in fossil fuel demand could happen earlier than forecast just six months ago, according to the International Energy Agency. In an opinion piece published in the Financial Times, IEA executive director Fatih Birol said the global deployment of solar panels over the past two years has been fast enough to align fully with the rate envisaged in the IEA’s ambitious pathway to net zero emissions by 2050. He added that heat pumps, vital for the sustainable and securing heating of buildings, are already outselling gas furnaces and boilers in the US and in a growing number of European countries. Separately, the agency’s new study finds that the rapidly growing global fleet of electric cars could avoid the need for the equivalent of 5mbpd of oil by 2030.

Renewables dominate US grid connection queue. Almost all energy projects in the connection queue for US grids are wind, solar, or battery energy storage, according to a recent study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, offering a glimpse at the future of US electricity. With more than 10,000 projects in the pipeline, they represent more than 2 terawatts of total power generation, or about 50% more than current generation capacity. Gas and coal account for less than 3.5% of total interconnection queue, down from over 35% in 2007.

Still, there is more work to do. The IEA says wind and solar would have to reach 41% of global electricity generation by 2030 in order for the power sector to become the first to reach net-zero emissions by 2040. With strong capital commitments from governments and businesses alike, we continue to see positive momentum in decarbonization themes, including Clean air and carbon reduction, Energy efficiency, and Smart mobility. Apart from top-down drivers, increased cost alignment will also continue to drive sustainability as a key long-term driver of investment returns.

Why is tax management important and how does it work?

Taxes on net realized capital gains can be a drag on investment returns. For that reason, taxable clients can benefit from various tax management techniques that seek to reduce the impact of taxes on investment returns. The two key techniques discussed include active capital gain deferral and active tax-loss harvesting.

One of the benefits of a separately managed account (SMA) is that clients own the cost basis of each security in the account. In taxable accounts, this means clients can therefore submit a tax-loss harvest request at any point in time during the year. The idea is that realized capital losses in a taxable account can be used to offset realized capital gains in that account or even capital gains realized elsewhere. Even if realized losses are not used in the current tax year, they can be carried over to future tax years. Therefore, tax-loss harvesting can be a helpful tool for taxable clients. Given the current market environment, there are many opportunities for tax-loss harvesting, but those opportunities can fade quickly and sometimes they’re gone by the end of the year. Therefore, it is important to take a year-round approach to tax loss harvesting.

In addition to tax-loss harvesting, active gain deferral is another important tax management technique where unrealized capital gains are deferred in a risk managed way to avoid unnecessary capital gains taxes. Portfolio turnover can generate taxes for our taxable clients, particularly when invested in an active strategy. Therefore, it is important to be thoughtful about the realization of capital gains in taxable accounts.

There are a lot of moving parts when it comes to tax management. Fortunately, UBS AM offers a service called Personalize Tax Management (PTM) on many of their investment strategies. PTM seeks to actively defer capital gains and harvest capital loses throughout the entire year, in a risk managed way, for taxable clients.

What is UBS Asset Management’s Personalize Tax Management (PTM) service?

Personalized Tax Management (PTM) is a service offered by UBS AM. PTM was launched in 2010 with the objective of seeking to offset the negative impacts of capital gains taxes for clients by deferring short- and long-term capital gains and harvesting capital losses in a risk-managed way throughout the entire year. UBS AM has over $15 billion (as of 3/31/2023) in tax-managed assets across a wide range of solutions ranging from active equity and multi-asset portfolios to indexed equity portfolios. Ultimately, the service is personalized because it looks at every client account individually for opportunities to deferrer capital gains and harvest capital losses. This is done proactively throughout the entire year and at the tax lot level. In addition to looking at each account individually from a tax and risk perspective, PTM also takes into account client specific tax rates and any external gains and losses they have. This way, if a client has externally reported realized gains PTM can attempt to offset some of those gains too. The key to the entire process is that it is risk aware, meaning its primary goal is to deliver pre-tax returns that are in-line with the returns of the selected strategy but with lower taxes.

Although PTM is designed to make tax-aware trades, potential benefits will vary based upon individual client circumstances. Neither UBS Asset Management nor UBS Financial Services Inc. provides tax advice on client accounts. Consult your tax advisor.

Our tax management approach

Our PTM team seeks to implement tax management by deferring capital gains and harvesting capital losses when we think it may be beneficial to your portfolio.

In doing this, we weigh how much estimated ‘tracking error’ (see below) a tax management trade would generate (i.e., the risk of pre-tax performance not following the model strategy as closely) versus how much of a tax benefit we think a tax management trade would provide. We are able to apply this framework to every investment decision we make in a PTM account at the tax-lot level by using our risk modeling and optimization tools.

What is ‘personalized’ about PTM?

PTM is customized for every client portfolio individually, at that client’s tax lot level and taking into account client-specific tax rates as well as external capital gain and loss information that the client provides to the Financial Advisor.

Key Risks

Risks associated with PTM include, but are not limited to:

UBS Asset Management will rely solely on the information provided by you and your Financial Advisor. If that information is inaccurate or incomplete, PTM may be ineffective or less effective, and your taxes may be adversely affected.

PTM can adversely affect portfolio performance when delaying the sale of some securities in an effort to reduce capital gains taxes, if during this time, the security's price declines, or when accelerating a sale to harvest capital losses if the security’s price appreciates after being sold.

Withdrawals from a PTM account can have adverse tax consequences, such as the realization (and possible taxation) of significant capital gains. If you discontinue PTM or change to a different investment strategy, you could realize significant capital gains subject to tax.

The potential benefits of PTM could be reduced due to changes in the federal tax rules or rates, or your own financial/tax circumstances.

https://www.ubs.com/us/en/wealth-management/insights/market-news/article.1589084.html,"S&P 500 EPS: Down but not out, for now","The turmoil in the banks has raised concerns that access to credit will become more challenging and lead to a slowdown in economic growth. While we agree that access to bank credit will likely become more difficult for certain segments of the economy, we think these headwinds will take time to show up in corporate fundamentals. In fact, we think 1Q23 numbers could be surprisingly resilient.

Early reporters—better than recent quarters

Results from the early reporters—roughly 20 S&P 500 constituents whose fiscal quarter ended in February— increase our conviction. The median company in this group has beaten earnings estimates by 6%, which is better than the roughly 3% beat witnessed in recent quarters. Management guidance about the outlook has also been healthy. The median 2Q EPS estimate for these companies is unchanged, versus a 2% decline for the next quarter in the most recent reporting seasons. In general, management teams highlighted that, so far, there has been no change in the outlook due to the banking stress.

Still, we don’t want to sound too exuberant about the upcoming 1Q results. Even if S&P 500 constituents beat earnings by 3-5%, that would still translate into a decline of 1–3% relative to the year ago period. And obviously results will vary by company and sector, with likely messy numbers from many of the smaller banks that are most exposed to the deposit flight and higher deposit costs.

Still, there are challenges ahead

Even though 1Q results may be good, we believe corporate profits still face challenges ahead. First, the yield curve—the spread between 10yr and 2yr US treasury yields—has been inverted on a sustainable basis since last summer. After all prior inversions in the last 50 years, the US economy has always slipped into recession, with the downturn starting about 15 months after the inversion. If history is a guide, economic conditions could be more challenging late this year.

Second, lending standards have been tightening for some time. The January 2023 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS) showed that a net 45% of banks tightened lending standards for large- and medium-sized firms.

Finally, although inflation is cooling, it remains too high. The Fed has more work to do in order to get inflation back down to its 2% target. And with the labor market still reasonably strong, we are skeptical the Fed will be able to cut interest rates this year. We think the Fed will likely need to keep monetary policy restrictive, forestalling any re-acceleration in economic growth that could re-ignite inflation.

Full year consensus estimates still look too high

Taken together, these conditions suggest investors should expect continued economic headwinds that will cap equity market upside and present downside risks in the months ahead. But the headwinds may not exert more sustained downward pressure on corporate profits and equity markets until later this year, and quite possibly late in the year. Consensus expectations for a re-acceleration in S&P 500 earnings growth and margins appears unlikely, in our view. We expect S&P 500 EPS to contract 5% in 2023 (USD 210) before growing by 10% (USD 230) in 2024. Our estimates are about 5% lower than bottom-up expectations.

Equities to remain range-bound

It's always difficult to determine how investors will perceive quarterly results. As we discussed, the results and guidance look poised to be better than what some investors may expect. And in some respects (the scope of the earnings beats and the near-term guidance), this earnings season could be better than the last few.

But we are also cognizant of the fact that the S&P 500 forward P/E of 18x is near its highest levels in about a year and higher than pre-pandemic levels. Further, it’s pretty unusual for the S&P 500 to trade above 18x. Historically this has only happened when consensus earnings growth expectations were robust (14% on average, compared to 4% today) and/or the 10-year Treasury yield was less than 2%. So despite sentiment that seems somewhat cautious, valuations appear to be much more optimistic. For this reason we think any earnings season-related upside will be somewhat limited.

We continue to think that the S&P 500 will remain in the wide range that has been in place over the last several months from the high 3,000s to the low 4,000s. Ultimately, what breaks the market out of this range will likely be investor conviction in a soft landing—which could drive the S&P 500 to around 4,400—or a hard landing—which could see the market fall to 3,300. Given the ongoing headwinds that we outlined above, we don’t think the risk-reward in the market is very compelling. Our year-end price target for the S&P 500 is 3,800.

Positioning

Given the headwinds we've highlighted, a defensive bias across sectors remains appropriate. While market breadth has been narrow this year and mega-cap “tech” has performed like a defensive, we think that investors can get much cheaper defensive exposure in consumer staples or utilities, whose valuations look low for a late cycle environment. We have most preferred views on the consumer staples, industrials, and utilities sectors and least preferred views on the consumer discretionary, financials, and information technology sectors.

Although we recently downgraded value stocks to neutral, we still prefer them to growth stocks which are rated least preferred. In the near-term, cyclical segments within value face elevated earnings risks and higher-quality growth stocks could continue to be perceived as “safe havens” during this period of economic uncertainty. But on a relative basis, growth stocks are trading at nearly twice their historical average valuation premium to value stocks and carry under-appreciated earnings risks. The double risk of elevated valuations and under-appreciated earnings risks in a potentially more challenging economic environment suggests growth stocks may be more vulnerable, in our view.

https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/our-approach/marketnews/article.1589166.html,Biotech: The Human Genome Project turns 20,"This was a Herculean task in its day, costing an estimated USD 2.7bn and taking years of manual effort. Two decades later, your genome can be mapped out in an afternoon for as little as USD 200.

In the last year, rising interest rates have hurt biotech valuations, like other growth stocks, and the recent banking turmoil has dented confidence in the venture capital industry, which provides capital to the sector’s startups. We currently view the healthcare sector as least preferred on a tactical investment horizon, in part due to relative valuations. But the long-term investment case for biotech remains intact and is worth considering:

COVID-19 is just one of many viral diseases that need to be addressed. The efficacy and speed of mRNA vaccine development came into full view during the pandemic, greatly improving health outcomes. But viral diseases go well beyond the coronavirus; other infections are in wide circulation today, posing significant mortality and morbidity risks. For example, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections have quietly surged after the pandemic, causing more than 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths a year in the US alone. Biotech could offer important treatments to address these risks, with positive impact to human life and health systems.

Biotech can offer investors binary outcomes. In most cases, biotech companies that do not pass clinical trials and testing will fail and swiftly go out of business. Those that succeed can establish demand more quickly than startups in other sectors, since the market fit typically is more obvious. For this reason, diversification across multiple companies in the industry is important. Biotech end-markets also tend to be less cyclical, as individual health needs are not directly linked to economic or market swings, although the funding cycle for unprofitable companies is important in driving sentiment toward and the performance of listed assets.

Private investors continue to fund promising research. Early-stage drug discovery is heavily reliant on venture capital given relatively scarce corporate funding. Despite rising headwinds, biotech fundraising has held up relatively well over the last year. According to Pitchbook, biotech and pharma raised around USD 31bn in venture capital in the US last year, down 21% from 2021, but a smaller decline than the 38% for fintech and 54% for consumer tech. At the same time, assets in impact investing strategies surpassed USD 1tr in 2022, a large portion of which was in venture capital and social themes.

So, while there are near-term risks to consider, we see opportunities in early-stage virology treatments and genetic therapies, especially given recent pressure on valuations. Many of these opportunities can best be accessed via private markets, though we recommend selectivity within venture capital and growth equity, and consideration of fund managers’ approaches to active venture building. Pressure on valuations remains a short-term risk, in our view, but also an attractive long-term opportunity to enter the market. In addition, many of these ventures seek to address diseases with no current treatments, offering investors a chance to align their portfolio with purpose and impact. Investors need to consider that private markets come with certain drawbacks, including the risk of an illiquid market, and those interested need to be willing and able to lock up capital for longer.

https://www.ubs.com/us/en/wealth-management/insights/market-news/article.1589006.html,Fixed income: Carry conscious,"March witnessed a large flight-to-quality bid as concerns over stability in the financial sector pushed the 10-year Treasury yield to slightly below the lower end of our forecast range, at 3.3%, hitting 3.25% during pockets of vulnerability. That 3.25% was also the prior tightening cycle peak witnessed in 2018. We have advocated being longer on interest rate risk since the beginning of this year and added to our exposure at the end of February when the 10-year yield hit 3.97%. While we continue to think the 10-year will end the year near 3.25%, our expectation is for the Federal Reserve to raise rates one more time—in May, by 25 basis points—then shift to a pause.

The difficulty with the current assessment is that when we look at historical 10-year yield trends moving closer to the Fed’s terminal rate dating back to the early 1980s, in some instances yields have trended lower, and in others they have trended higher up to the time the Fed pauses. However, once the Fed pauses, every time since 1984, the 10-year yield has declined, awaiting the next phase of monetary policy—i.e., an easing.

Historically, the first easing has occurred between six and seven months after the Fed pauses. However, given the instability witnessed in March—and the competing narratives over a soft or hard landing—volatility has heightened, and what would normally occur post-pause has been pushed forward. The market has moved the first Fed easing from seven months to a mere two months after the pause, while the 10-year yield has fallen 100bps from the 2022 high of 4.25% reached in October to the 3.25%witnessed last Thursday. Our near-term range in 10-year yield now resides between 3.25% and 3.75%, with the expectation of lower yields in 2H23.

Although we remain with a bullish tilt on interest rates, we do anticipate more stability in the near term, accompanied by a decline in volatility. Within our fixed income portfolio, we have had a least preferred in high yield (HY) and in senior loans versus investment grade (IG) corporates and agency MBS. Our least preferred in loans versus IG corporates was initiated on 20 October when the 10-year yield was at 4.23%. We have guided investors with our view of 10-year yield ranges, which have worked well in deciding when to lock in yields and when not to chase an illiquid, volatile market.

With the market reaching the lower end of our yield range, we are trimming some of our incremental long positioning. With loans being a floating-rate asset class, and IG corporates’ duration at seven years, this performance will be dominated by the move in interest rates versus spread compression. While we maintain the overall up-in-quality bias within our portfolio, we do not believe rates will move materially lower, given the easing priced in and rising recession expectations over the near term, to mitigate the loss in yields between loans and IG corporates. We therefore move to neutral on senior loans and take our profit.

We maintain our slower growth outlook into 2H23 and continue to have agency MBS and IG corporates as our most preferred allocation.

https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/our-approach/marketnews/article.1589059.html,China’s March imports underscore positive commodity outlook,"China’s imports in March fell 1.4% y/y, beating market expectations and reflecting a marked improvement from a fall of 10.2% in the January to February period. Exports last month also posted a surprise surge, according to customs data, as the world’s second largest economy continues its recovery following three years of zero-COVID policies.

More specifically, China’s crude oil imports jumped 22.5% from March last year to 12.4mbpd, marking the highest monthly level since June 2020, and its soybean purchases were up 7.9% y/y to 6.9 million tonnes.

Accelerating growth in China is one of the reasons we continue to favor exposure to broad commodities, but we also see other supporting factors that will underpin the sector’s total return outlook of around 20% over the next 12 months.

A tightening oil market. Brent crude prices have risen nearly 20% since their March low as the market refocuses on fundamental tightness. Recent data shows renewed large on-land inventory drops of more than 30 million barrels over the past several weeks across the US, Europe, Singapore, Japan and Fujairah, suggesting that the market remained undersupplied. Iraq’s exports from the north have yet to resume, with 500,000bpd of oil output lost since 25 March. In addition, we think the voluntary production cuts by nine OPEC+ members should tighten the oil market further from May onwards.

Lingering climate and geopolitical risks for agricultural commodities. While Russia agreed to extend the Black Sea grain deal last month, the renewal covers only half of the intended period. The war also has a longer-lasting impact on output from Ukraine as farmers’ ability to prepare fields and plant seeds has been disrupted. Separately, the probability of an El Niño event by year-end has risen to 60%. Historically, this event has negatively affected yields for corn, rice, and wheat.

Improving outlook for industrial metals. China’s demand recovery for industrial metals has been slower than expected, with copper imports in March 19% lower than a year ago. But we expect the situation to improve as Chinese consumption enters a peak season amid Beijing’s pro-growth policy focus. We’ve recently raised our forecast for property sales this year following a strong March number, and we expect the country’s electrical network sector to grow 3.3%. Separately, supply challenges in South America should leave the copper market with a marginal deficit in 2023. Overall, industrial metal inventories are at structurally low levels and remain supportive for prices.

So, we maintain our most preferred rating on commodities in our global strategy, and recommend investors to take direct exposure. Downward-sloping curves offer roll gains, while higher yields have improved returns on cash collateral. Given the unique characteristics and drivers of individual commodities, actively managed strategies should enable investors to potentially boost their returns relative to risk.",[],

ZURICH, April 11 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and UBS (UBSG.S) must freeze any job cuts planned as part of their emergency merger, the Swiss Bank Employees' Association (SBPV) said on Tuesday, in an open letter to the country's parliament.

SBPV managing director Natalia Ferrara has written to lawmakers to demand they consider staff affected by the collapse of Credit Suisse and halt any job losses until the end of 2023.

""We ... call on you to support our demand for a freeze on layoffs by the end of 2023 in parliament,"" Ferrara wrote in the letter seen by Reuters.

""Politicians must not shirk their responsibility,"" she added.

The Swiss parliament is due to meet in extraordinary session on Tuesday to discuss the state-sponsored rescue of Credit Suisse which took place last month.

UBS agreed to buy Zurich rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.31 billion) in a deal engineered by the government, the central bank and market regulator to avoid a meltdown in the country's financial system.

""For the past three weeks, many of the approximately 17,000 employees at Credit Suisse and the 22,000 UBS employees have been looking at their future with uncertainty,"" said Ferrara, referring to the staff numbers in Switzerland.

Credit Suisse employs 45,000 people globally, while UBS has 74,000 in total.

""In the public debate about the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, there is a lot of talk about numbers, money, regulation, 'too big to fail' or bonuses,"" wrote Ferrara, whose organisation represents 6,000 workers in Switzerland.

""But the affected employees of the two banks remain only a side note. That needs to change.""

UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti last week warned there would be ""change and hard decisions"" ahead following the takeover.

The giant bank created could reduce its workforce by 20%-30%, it has been reported by Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger, with 11,000 jobs being cut in Switzerland.

UBS has said it is too early to speculate on job cuts.

Ferrara said it was not the fault of the bank employees that the rescue was required, adding it would take months for UBS's plans to be worked out.

""Now it is time for the affected employees of the two banks to be given protection and respect,"" Ferrara wrote in the letter that was first published by Swiss newspaper Blick on Tuesday.

""It must not be the case that parliament debates money and technical aspects of the CS rescue for days during the extraordinary session and the people affected are forgotten.""

UBS Group AG Attracts Institutional Investors and Analyst Attention

UBS Group AG, a multinational investment bank based in Switzerland, has recently gained the interest of several large institutional investors and hedge funds. Among them are First Republic Investment Management Inc. with a new stake in UBS worth $187,000, Achmea Investment Management B.V. increasing their holdings in the bank’s stock by 16.4%, Two Sigma Advisers LP lifting its stake to over 1.5 million shares and Zhang Financial LLC and Stonegate Investment Group both acquiring new positions in UBS Group.

Several research analysts have also issued reports on UBS’s performance, with Bank of America upgrading the bank’s rating from ‘neutral’ to ‘buy’, Societe Generale downgrading to ‘hold’, StockNews.com changing it from ‘buy’ to ‘hold’, Keefe Bruyette & Woods downgrading it to ‘underperform’ and Royal Bank of Canada downgrading from ‘outperform’ to ‘sector perform’.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swiss-upper-house-offers-olive-101944382.html,Swiss Parliament Nears Deal on UBS Guarantees as MPs Change Vote,"(Bloomberg) -- Swiss parliament is approaching a deal to push through government guarantees for UBS Group AG’s takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG after a upper houses compromise was met with approval in the lower chamber.

Most Read from Bloomberg

“The majority of our party will vote for this proposal if the government will pursue higher capital ratios and restricted bonuses,” Social Democrat lawmaker Roger Nordmann said in the lower house in Bern on Wednesday. The stricter stance on banks is “a major development,” he said.

The 200-member lower house late on Tuesday voted against the 109 billion francs ($120 billion) in guarantees. While that was a symbolic vote that can’t stop the deal, it clashed with the upper house’s approval earlier in the day.

As a stalemate would force the bill to fail, the upper house earlier today adopted amendments in line with what their lower-house colleagues had demanded. Those provisions seek to adjust the law to limit the risks systemically relevant banks pose to taxpayers.

Comments by Nordmann and other lower-house lawmakers now suggest that a majority will be achieved in both chambers, allowing Switzerland to avoid an embarrassing situation.

Irrespective of the vote, parliament can’t stop the takeover negotiated last month as the government already got approval from a small group of senior lawmakers, which is entitled to act on behalf of parliament in case of urgency.

The key demand the upper house now passed calls on the government to revise banking laws demanding higher capital requirements and restrictions on bonuses. But lawmakers’ agreed wording only stipulates that the executive should “examine” this, not that it is “instructed” to do so.

Story continues

“We are agreed that after the events of March 19 we cannot just move on,” said Pirmin Bischof, a Center Alliance member in the upper house, referring to the day the deal was agreed. “The too-big-to-fail regulation just simply didn’t have any effect. And so we need to ask the government to come up with a changed law that will solve this problem.”

Symbolic Vote

The lower house’s rejection — just before midnight on Tuesday — highlights the anger among lawmakers on both sides of the political spectrum ahead of national elections later this year. An overall rejection would send a signal of Switzerland’s legislative not backing the deal, which some MPs suggested should be done.

“We should only approve a deal when it’s good enough for the Confederation — right now this deal is only good enough for UBS,” said Thomas Minder, adding that a ‘no’ wouldn’t be the “end of the world.”

Lawmakers also acknowledged their lack of power of actually influencing the deal.

“If we could really turn down the loans here, I believe nobody would hesitate,” said Eva Herzog of the Social Democrats.

The standoff is largely symbolic. The government had said that “if parliament refuses subsequent approval, it will be tantamount to a political reprimand” for the group of senior lawmakers that green-lit it, but would have “no legal effect.”

The Credit Suisse crisis three weeks ago has shaken Switzerland, evoking memories of the Great Financial Crisis. The government argued on Tuesday that the creation of a Swiss banking juggernaut was the best solution among a limited number of options.

In addition to state guarantees, the Swiss National Bank offered liquidity assistance. SNB sight deposit numbers published this week suggest that after accessing such money, Credit Suisse may have returned more than half of the funds.

Switzerland’s executive isn’t made up of a coalition or an outright majority, but of seven ministers from the country’s four largest parties. They usually make decisions by consensus and try to find pragmatic compromises — often outside of party lines.

Ministers don’t publicly oppose government decisions, irrespective of their parties’ stance on a matter or how they personally voted behind closed doors.

This setup means that parliament offers parties the most prominent platform to sway voters, which explains aggressive comments in that forum even if they at times lack bite.

As is usually the case, we did not find anything too surprising in the minutes, but they still provide useful details on the conversations that took place at the meeting.

One thing that is clear from the minutes is that at one point, the FOMC was prepared to raise the ""dots,"" which indicate expectations for the future path of Fed policy rates, by a considerable amount. This was based on the strength of the economic data published since the previous SEP in December, especially regarding inflation and the labor market. However, the developments in the banking system created a lot of additional uncertainty over the outlook. The FOMC was anticipating that credit tightening would have a negative impact on economic activity and inflation, especially considering that the rate hikes the Fed had previously implemented were already weighing on business investment. They also thought that there could be an impact on consumer sentiment that could lead to restraint on spending. As we noted at the time of the meeting, the forecasts in the SEP were quite pessimistic. In the end, the median dot for 2023 was left unchanged at 5.1%, corresponding to one more 25-basis-point rate hike from the current level. Regarding the decision to hike rates itself, some FOMC members said that, before the developments in the banking system, they would have considered a 50-basis-point hike.

The minutes make it clear that the Fed itself is uncertain over how many more rate hikes it will implement. At the time of the meeting, FOMC participants felt that the actions by the Fed and other government agencies had helped to calm tensions in the banking system. Given recent developments, we would not expect the banking system to prevent the Fed from hiking if they thought it was needed to bring inflation down. However, some recent economic data, including this morning's inflation report, suggests to us that the Fed is likely close to the end of the rate hiking cycle.

https://www.ubs.com/us/en/wealth-management/insights/market-news/article.1588994.html,"Pause or hike, caution is still warranted","The US economy cooling and a Fed pivot not imminent, CIO believes the environment for equities will remain challenging in the coming months. (ddp)

According to its latest median dot plot projection, the Fed is set to deliver one more 25bps increase this year before pausing for the rest of 2023.

But irrespective of whether the Fed delivers a further rate increase, we see reasons to be cautious about the outlook for the US economy and corporate earnings.

US inflation remains sticky and well above target. US inflation has remained stubbornly high despite the 475bps of cumulative rate hikes. March CPI data due later today will provide evidence on whether US inflation remains sticky. According to a Reuters poll, the consensus forecast is for headline CPI to ease to 5.1% year-over-year from 6% in February. However, the more important core inflation measure is expected to have increased 0.4% m/m in March from 0.3% in February, bringing annual core CPI up to 5.6% y/y from 5.5% previously.

Even if the Fed opts to pause next month, with US inflation still running well above its 2% target, the central bank will want to see the hikes delivered thus far having the desired effect of bringing inflation down closer to that target before it can consider any rate cuts (i.e., a pivot).

The real US economy is starting to hurt from the impact of tightening to date. US recession risks are rising, as evidenced by the latest March ISM manufacturing PMI falling to 46.3, its lowest level since May 2020 and the fifth consecutive month in contraction territory. The US labor market is also starting to cool, with March nonfarm payrolls and JOLTS data showing slower wage growth and lower job openings.

Credit conditions are tightening as banking sector turmoil adds to the pain from rate hikes. According to the Dallas Fed Banking Conditions Survey conducted 21–27 March, commercial and industrial loans, real estate lending, and loan volumes have fallen while credit standards have continued to tighten. This concern was also highlighted by Chicago Fed Chief Austan Goolsbee, who said yesterday that the US central bank should exercise “prudence and patience” in raising rates as it needs to assess how much credit conditions have tightened following the banking turmoil. Historically, tighter credit conditions have been correlated with weaker corporate earnings.

So, with the US economy cooling and a Fed pivot not imminent, we believe the environment for equities will remain challenging in the coming months. We are least preferred on global equities, including the US, where we expect earnings to contract 4.5% this year. We prefer bonds to equities, and we like high grade (government), investment grade, and sustainable bonds relative to high yield bonds. Apart from the potential tailwinds from an eventual Fed pivot, we think that high-quality bonds can offer defensive traits to a portfolio in the event of a sharper economic downturn.

In year-over-year terms, the inflation rate slowed to 5%, the lowest since May 2021 and down from the peak of 9.1% last June. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, increased 0.4%. Both bond and equity markets rallied after the release.

Today's report provides clearer signs that inflation is cooling off. Over the past few months, shelter has been one of the biggest inflation drivers, even though data on new leases shows that rent increases have slowed sharply. In March, rent of primary residence slowed to 0.5%, down from 0.8% in February, and given the lags in the data, it is likely that rents will continue to slow over the course of 2023. As shown in the chart, at long last it appears that core services inflation has peaked. In the other direction, it appears that the period of maximum deflationary pressure on goods is also over. Some prices that became overheated at the height of the pandemic have fallen back to more normal levels, leaving less room for further declines. We expect goods inflation to remain subdued, but it is unlikely to drag down overall inflation as much as it has in recent months.

In our view, the data will not be enough for the Fed to declare victory over inflation, and we look for another rate hike at the next FOMC meeting on 3 May. However, if the data continues to show the labor market and inflation cooling off, this could be the last hike of the cycle.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The lower house rejected a compromise offered by the upper house, leading to a failure of the bill and ending parliamentary proceedings. Irrespective of the vote, parliament can’t stop the takeover negotiated last month as a designated committee of lawmakers had already signed off on it.

The rejection nonetheless casts a shadow over the already-fraught process of integrating two global banks, particularly as significant job cuts loom in Switzerland in a year when national elections are due. In the aftermath of the historic $3.3 billion deal, lawmakers have called for various changes including greater powers for the financial regulator Finma, though little consensus has emerged.

“The majority in parliament wanted to make a statement,” said Michael Hermann, a political scientist and head of Zurich-based research institute Sotomo. “This shows that the topic politically causes high waves in Switzerland.”

A coalition of the populist right and the left generated enough votes to ensure the bill didn’t pass. It would have given the stamp of approval for putting state funds of as much $120 billion at stake. The Swiss People’s Party SVP, which forms the largest bloc, lobbied together with the Greens and some Social Democrats against it.

“The SVP has been insisting since 2008 that we have no bank that cannot go bankrupt,” said Pirmin Schwander, a member of the lower house for the party. The state guarantees only fuel a “narcissistic company culture” among bankers, he said.

UBS Effect

The vote, with 103 ballots against, 71 in favor and eight abstentions, is a defeat for Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter and the delegation of senior lawmakers which agreed to the backstop on behalf of parliament before the takeover was announced in March.

The debate is unlikely to have any immediate effect on UBS, but may indicate appetite for stricter rules on the horizon. UBS has already faced questions over the combined company’s heft — double the size of the Swiss economy — and its potential local dominance. UBS’s vice chairman said last week that the bank will consider all options for Credit Suisse’s Swiss unit.

The Swiss government earlier this month said that UBS must ensure its pay structures encourage employees to avoid using the state guarantee.

Politicians and business leaders had voiced worries that the combined lender will have excessive market power, leading to a loss of competition. Despite the risks involved in integrating Credit Suisse, UBS stands to become a banking “powerhouse” post merger, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in a note Tuesday.

The deal was also met with little public enthusiasm.

During the afternoon it looked like the parliament in Bern could reach an agreement, with some Social Democrats changing their views. A stricter stance on banks — a compromise had lined out higher equity requirements and restricted bonuses — is “a major development,” Social Democrat lawmaker Roger Nordmann had said.

“The debate is ticked off now. There will be no further cleanup of the differences between parliament and government,” Sotomo’s Hermann said. “Now everyone can feel vindicated again that democracy has been eroded. This discontent with the system will further strengthen populists and the far right.”

(Getty Images)

Where are the opportunities in fixed income?

Government bond yields have fallen from their early March highs as banking sector turbulence added to fears of slowing economic growth. We don't think a full-scale banking crisis is likely. But we do see a higher probability that central bank rate-hiking cycles will end sooner. At the time of writing, markets are pricing a peak in the US federal funds rate in May.

With the likely end of the rate-hike cycle approaching, and risks to the US growth outlook mounting, we think it's time to increase exposure to bonds. Yields, though off their peak, still look attractive, and we see the potential for capital gains in the event of a deeper economic slowdown. We think investors holding excess cash should consider opportunities to lock in today's yields. We prefer high grade (government), investment grade, and sustainable bonds relative to high yield bonds. We also like emerging market bonds.

Can alternatives help navigate correlated markets?

Alternative assets like hedge funds and private market investments can provide investors with the opportunity to diversify their sources of return at a time of heightened uncertainty in global markets, if they are able to tolerate the risks involved.

In hedge funds, we think strategies that can capitalize on market dislocations while providing stable diversification benefits should be well positioned in a year when uncertainty and macro risks are likely to stay elevated. We like macro managers’ ability to take long/short positions across a range of asset classes, regions and financial instruments; equity market neutral funds’ appeal in providing uncorrelated returns; and multi-strategy funds’ diversified approach and versatility. Meanwhile, private market secondaries and distressed strategies could be well positioned to buy assets at attractive valuations.

Investors in alternative assets must be able to lock up capital for longer and should consider risks like reduced liquidity, higher costs, and complexities.

What are the implications of China's recovery?

China's reopening has paved the way for an economic recovery in 2023. The official March PMI data underlined that the rebound remains on track. Backed by a resurgence in consumption and resilient investment, we expect Chinese GDP growth of around 5.5% y/y this year.

MSCI China fell 1% last week after three weeks of gains. But we see further upside for Chinese equities, supported by strong earnings growth. We retain a most preferred view on emerging market equities, including Chinese stocks, and we see opportunities in reopening beneficiaries. We also think select property developer bonds, commodities, the yuan, and the Australian dollar may emerge as winners as China's economy continues to pick up.

The upper house gave its green light earlier in the day.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Lawmakers from both sides of the political spectrum again lined up to blame the government, regulators and the bank’s management for failures around the takeover last month. Two hours into the debate in the lower house, it wasn’t clear if a vote on the guarantees would be held Tuesday night.

Damien Cottier, an MP with the Liberal-Radicals, called the day the deal was struck a “day of shame” for Switzerland before going on to call it the “least-bad and least risky” option.

Cottier’s tone reflects that of many frustrated lawmakers who are critical — and in an election year want to be seen as being so — of the banks and the government while at the same time are wary of trying to block the deal. Though parliament doesn’t have the power to derail the takeover, the extraordinary session has forced the government to once again defend the unpopular emergency takeover by UBS Group AG announced on March 19.

In that vein, Swiss President Alain Berset opened the lower-house debate after 7pm local time by saying Credit Suisse’s “negative spiral” spurred his government into action. Temporary nationalisation, a forced bankruptcy and orderly wind-down of the bank were all considered but rejected in favor of the UBS takeover, he said.

The government, Swiss National Bank and Swiss banking regulator Finma “acted in a decisive manner to restore confidence,” Berset said.

Earlier in the day, more than a dozen lawmakers in the upper house voiced their grievances. Their concerns varied from being circumvented in the emergency legislation, to regulatory lapses that allowed Credit Suisse’s failings to go un-addressed, to demanding accountability for the bank’s management.

“The legal possibilities against the bankers responsible and the possibilities to claw back bonuses need to be exhausted to the fullest extent,” said the president of the Free Democrats Thierry Burkart.

Some legislators called for greater powers for the financial regulator, Finma, amid a broader review of too-big-to-fail rules for the sector, while others asked for a parliamentary inquiry commission. Quick legislative changes are unlikely though, as became apparent during the debate.

The deal — described by Berset earlier as the best option to re-establish confidence in markets — created a banking giant whose assets are more than twice the size of the Swiss economy.

Job Cuts

Politicians and business leaders have voiced worries that the combined lender will have excessive market power, leading to a loss of competition. Despite the risks involved in integrating Credit Suisse, UBS stands to become a banking “powerhouse” post merger, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in a note Tuesday.

UBS, already one of the world’s largest wealth managers, is now taking over a key rival for a fraction of the value of its assets and receiving as much as 9 billion Swiss francs in government loss guarantees.

Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter made clear that if these guarantees turned out to be not enough, it would be up to parliament to decide on an extension. The government and UBS agreed on the lender taking on the first 5 billion francs in potential losses, before the administration steps in for the next 9 billion.

Before the takeover, Credit Suisse had already planned to cut as many as 9,000 jobs worldwide over the coming years. The overlaps between the two banks’ businesses will likely lead to that number rising, though executives including UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher have said that it’s too early to say how big the cuts will be.

‘Finma Failed’

Finma didn’t move in time, said Heidi Z’graggen, upper-house member of the Center Alliance.

“Finma’s job is to protect shareholder rights and ensure functioning of the financial center,” she said. “At this, Finma failed.”

A parliamentary inquiry commission is necessary to answer whether the financial regulator, the Swiss National Bank and the finance ministry reacted properly, she said. Such a body would have subpoena powers to summon witnesses.

Given the merger has been met with little public enthusiasm, parliament is also trying to curtail government powers in the future: They are attempting to block the use of emergency measures to push through deals like this.

Why? He highlighted the following reasons in a recent UBS sector report:

excess liquidity rapidly soaked up by a higher official cash rate,

tighter household budgets, and

financial adviser numbers continuing to decline.

Funds under management in retail platforms – excluding cash trusts such as term deposits – rose by 3.5% to $1.04 trillion in the final quarter of 2022, versus the September quarter. But net funds flows of $3.7 billion were 42% lower quarter-on-quarter, which contributed 0.4% to funds under management.

Taken together, this means the December quarter was the weakest in two years, “continuing the unwind of strong flows during the COVID period,” said Russell.

He also emphasised this was a continuation of a long-term skew away from incumbents in the platform space – including the likes of Netwealth and HUB24.

“All of the incumbents – with the exception of Macquarie (ASX: MQG) – experienced net outflows,” said Russell, pointing out that this cohort’s market share dipped below 72%. “By contrast, specialised platforms collected 107% of industry flows, relative to FUM share of just 14%, an obvious precursor to higher FUM share in future.”

The BT Panorama platform – part of Pendal Group, which was acquired by Perpetual (ASX: PPT) earlier this year – saw the biggest outflows, probably due to ownership uncertainty at the time.

Another of the incumbents, Macquarie, saw an additional $1.3 billion added to its FUM in the fourth-quarter 2022. Russell described this as “resilient flows performance, implying flows share well ahead of its FUM share.”

Two standouts among the specialist platforms were:

Netwealth (ASX: NWL), and

HUB24 (ASX: HUB).

As Russell explained: “HUB flows remained ahead of all peers, despite both already reporting weaker flows versus prior periods.”

“NWL's recent update on its flows during the March 2023 quarter implies an optimistic turnaround in flows in the seasonally strong June quarter.”

HUB is due to provide another update on Tuesday 18 April.

Russell noted that the latest data on flows in this part of the financial sector supports his team’s thesis of ongoing fragmentation among retail wealth platforms.

“We believe that the growth runway for specialist platforms is very long, and despite several years of strong growth, Netwealth and HUB24 penetration levels remain low,” he said.

Global currency regimes are sticky: The US dollar dominates financial markets and international trade. Changes in the world’s dominant currency have historically taken a long time to materialize. Even as great economic powers rise and fall, their currencies’ reserve status tend to survive well past the peak of their influence. The latest IMF survey on the currency composition of global foreign exchange reserves reveals that the share of US dollars held by central banks still stands at almost 60%. The greenback is also used in over 40% of every global payment and dominates 85% of trade finance contracts, according to SWIFT.

As a result, the US continues to attract large flows of foreign investment. Of course, the US must treat the privilege of being able to issue the world’s preeminent currency with respect.

Geopolitics enter the equation: Although shifts in the global currency order typically take place at a glacial pace, rising geopolitical tensions can trigger quicker adjustments. China, for instance, is working to accelerate the yuan's internationalization as relations remain tense with the US. Although these efforts are unlikely to yield overnight success, they plant the seeds of a more diversified currency landscape ahead.

China, for instance, is working to accelerate the yuan's internationalization as relations remain tense with the US. Although these efforts are unlikely to yield overnight success, they plant the seeds of a more diversified currency landscape ahead. Gold has become the diversifier of choice: Last year saw very strong central bank buying of gold following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, marking the 13th consecutive year of net purchases and the highest level of annual demand on record dating back to 1950. As the yellow metal carries no credit or counter-party risk, some central banks may deem it as being better insulated from financial sanctions.

Conclusion and investment implications

All in all, we think the dollar's reign will live on. At the same time, it will likely make some room for competitors along the way.

From a cyclical perspective, we expect the US dollar to weaken as the US growth and interest rate premium relative to the rest of the world erodes in the coming months. It is important to note that our call for a weaker US dollar in the near future is not based on the assumption of a declining global currency status.

With this in mind, we recommend investors to diversify their dollar cash or fixed income holdings, reduce allocations to US equities, or position in options or structured strategies that could deliver positive returns in the event of dollar weakness. On a relative basis, we prefer the Australian dollar as well as the Swiss franc, euro, pound, and yen.



We also see gold as an attractive portfolio diversifier and target a price of USD 2,200/oz over the next 12 months. Higher investor confidence that the Federal Reserve is approaching the peak in interest rates should bolster demand for the yellow metal. We also see official sector demand remaining strong for at least another year. In addition, gold has a good track record as a hedge against historical episodes of financial stress.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/retail-store-closings-prediction-ubs-analyst/,"Wall Street says 50,000 retail stores will close in 5 years","The past year has seen 2,000 retail store closures, with the likes of Bed Bath & Beyond, Foot Locker and Walmart shuttering locations as they look to save money. But that trickle is set to turn into a flood in the next five years, according to one Wall Street analysis that predicts 50,000 stores will close.

If the economy falls into a prolonged recession, closures could reach 90,000, analysts at UBS said in a research note published Tuesday. Smaller operations that employ 500 or fewer people are most likely to close, they wrote.

The U.S. currently has roughly 940,000 stores and the UBS prediction ""simply implies that there will be 5% fewer stores by the end of 2027,"" analysts said.

The forecast is particularly troubling because, according to the National Retail Federation, about 70% of retail sales still come from brick-and-mortar stores, meaning retailers could suffer greater losses once they close off the places where customers physically stroll and shop.

UBS pointed to three factors causing retail locations to close: the ever-growing prominence of online shopping; increased borrowing costs and customers tightening their wallets due to inflation.

Stubbornly high inflation in recent months has pinched household budgets, causing consumers to pay elevated prices for everyday staples like gas, groceries, clothes and housing.

Clothing, electronics and home furnishing stores will likely bear the brunt of closings in the coming years because more of their shoppers will opt to purchase those items online, UBS said. They project closures of 13,840 clothing stores, 9,190 electronics locations and 4,090 furniture stores.

By comparison, UBS expects home improvement stores to lose only 210 locations and auto parts stores to stay steady. Both job growth and year-over-year sales have increased at home improvement and auto parts stores, UBS said — two reasons why that sector of retail likely won't suffer as many closings in the future.

Major retailers — including Costco, Home Depot, Lowe's and Target — stand to benefit the most from the predicted store closings, UBS said. The closings of smaller operators would mean roughly $210 billion in retail sales would be up for grabs, analysts said.

""This translates to $1,600 annual spend per household that has the potential to shift to the leading retailers,"" UBS analysts said.

Some major retailers are already well into the closing spree. Companies shuttered about 1,500 stores last fall, UBS noted.

Bed Bath & Beyond said it plans to close nearly 240 stores this year as part of a larger effort to avoid bankruptcy. Walmart is closing more than a dozen low-performing locations in major cities like Atlanta, Chicago, Portland and Washington, D.C. Foot Locker said last month it plans to close 400 mall-based stores by 2026 and open more than 300 free-standing locations.","['Khristopher J. Brooks', 'Khristopher J.

GENEVA (AP) — UBS said Wednesday that it’s bringing back former CEO Sergio Ermotti to lead the Swiss bank as it executes a government-orchestrated plan to take over struggling rival Credit Suisse .

Ermotti, who was the bank’s top executive for nine years and led a turnaround following the 2008 global financial crisis, will take over next Wednesday from CEO Ralph Hamers.

Hamers took up the job in November 2020 and will remain at UBS during a transition period “to ensure a successful closure of the transaction and a smooth handover,” the bank said in a statement.

“Whilst Ralph was capable of doing the job, we felt that Sergio was better suited to navigating these things,” Chairman Colm Kelleher said on a conference call, alluding to the UBS board decision. “I cannot reemphasize how big this deal is in terms of financial history and financial engineering that’s required.”

UBS credited Ermotti, who is now chairman of insurer Swiss Re, for having “cut its footprint” and changing the culture of the bank — and it pointed to his experience in bringing big financial institutions together.

Ermotti, who hails from the southern, mostly Italian-speaking Swiss region of Ticino, acknowledged that “coming back to manage this situation is a challenge” but felt “a sense of call-of-duty aspect” to return.

Plus, he said he had contemplated a tie-up like the one with Credit Suisse while previously in the top job, and it would be a bit of a ”contradiction” for him not to accept the post “to basically execute on what I believe was the right next move for UBS.”

Kelleher said he called Ermotti “to explore the possibility of this” a day after the emergency takeover deal was settled on March 19, which involved Swiss regulators, the federal government and top executives at both banks.

“This is is the biggest single financial transaction since 2008. That brings significant execution risk,” Kelleher said.

The hastily arranged, $3.25 billion deal for Credit Suisse aimed to stem the upheaval in the global financial system after the collapse of two U.S. banks and jitters about long-running troubles at Credit Suisse led shares of Switzerland’s second-largest bank to tank and customers to pull out their money.

ADVERTISEMENT

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after the central bank’s plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and customers. The Swiss executive branch passed emergency measures to bypass shareholder approval.

Uncertainties still lie ahead, including a U.S. Senate committee report released Wednesday that says Credit Suisse violated a plea agreement with U.S. authorities by failing to report secret offshore accounts that wealthy Americans used to avoid paying taxes.

UBS said it assessed outstanding lawsuits and investigations as part of the Credit Suisse acquisition and expects the deal to be beneficial for shareholders. It says it’s working to close the sale and get approval from regulators in the coming weeks or months.

ADVERTISEMENT

Hamers, the outgoing CEO, said UBS executives want to ensure “a digestible transaction” in terms of risk. He said there were plans to “manage down the investment bank” at Credit Suisse because many of the activities were not central for UBS.

UBS leaders announced no immediate plan about job cuts linked to the deal.

Swiss lawmakers and academics have raised concerns that the deal could create an unwieldy Swiss banking behemoth, while UBS executives said regulatory issues loom internationally before the deal can close .

Ermotti suggested he didn’t view “too big too fail” concerns as a problem.

“I do think that scale and size is not a problem if it is focused and well-managed,” he said. “For me, the debate nowadays is not ‘too big to fail’ but ‘too small to survive’ — and we want to be a winner.”

Many Credit Suisse customers have expressed regret at the looming disappearance of a 167-year-old bank that has been a pillar of Switzerland’s renowned banking and financial industry.

Evercore gets upgraded by two notches to buy

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) on Wednesday drew an upgrade to buy from hold at UBS on the stock's attractive valuation and lower risk profile than its peers.

UBS also upgraded boutique investment bank Evercore Inc. (EVR) by two notches to buy from sell and adjusted price targets for Morgan Stanley (MS), as well as wealth-management specialists Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW), Ameriprise Financial Inc. (AMP), LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (LPLA), Stifel Financial Corp. (SF) and Regions Financial Corp. (RF).

Analyst Brennan Hawken said Goldman Sachs ""appears well positioned to outperform amidst elevated levels of market volatility"" with potential growth in its asset- and wealth-management business and transactional banking.

Goldman Sachs offers less exposure to consumer deposits and commercial banking than other firms, analysts said.

The investment bank also enjoys an opportunity to accelerate its asset-management business through ""attractively priced mergers and acquisitions,"" Hawken said.

UBS hiked Goldman's price target to $385 a share from $350 a share.

Shares of Goldman Sachs rose 0.8%.

Evercore stock rose 1.5% after UBS rated the bank a buy and lifted its price target to $135 a share from $112.

Hawken said Evercore ""is executing better than expected"" in the downtrodden business of mergers and acquisition advisory services.

While M&A completion volumes were down 50% in the first quarter, UBS is forecasting a less severe 20% drop in its M&A advisory business.

The figure indicates that Evercore's investment-banking relationships ""are strong enough to generate over $500 million per quarter even though financing banks are in a better competitive position,"" Hawken said.

In terms of price-target adjustments, Evercore and Goldman were the only two out of 11 financial stocks covered by UBS to get increases instead of price cuts on Wednesday.

UBS reduced its price target for Morgan Stanley to $98 a share from $108 and reiterated a buy rating.

UBS also reiterated buy ratings on Schwab and Ameriprise and cut their price targets to $70 from $90 for the former and to $285 from $400 for the latter.

UBS reiterated a neutral rating on LPL Financial and cut its price target on the stock to $215 from $235.

Analysts also reiterated a neutral rating on Stifel Financial and cut their price target by $6 to $62. A neutral rating was reiterated for Regions Financial, while its price target was reduced to $100 from $130.

UBS reiterated a buy rating on Houlihan Lokey Inc. (HLI) and cut its price target to $105 from $115. It kept its neutral rating on Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) and reduced its price target to $32 from $40. It also reiterated a sell rating on Moelis & Co. (MC) and reduced its price target to $27 from $30.

UBS sought to reassure investors at its annual general meeting on Wednesday against a fraught political backdrop following its takeover of fallen rival Credit Suisse last month. The 1,128 shareholders gathered in Basel were looking for clarity on the board's integration plan after the ""shotgun wedding"" between Switzerland's two biggest banks, which remains mired in controversy, legal peril and public skepticism. related investing news UBS says it's time to buy this banking giant with very low risk ahead UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher told the audience that March 19, the date of the emergency rescue of Credit Suisse from the brink of collapse, was a ""historic day and a day we hoped would never come."" But he said the merger also presents ""a new beginning and huge opportunities ahead for the combined bank and the Swiss financial sector as a whole."" He emphasized UBS' continued focus on its wealth management and Swiss business and confirmed that the bank would reduce the capital allocated to its investment arm to below 25% of risk-weighted assets. ""Whilst we did not initiate these discussions, we believe that this transaction is financially attractive to UBS shareholders,"" Kelleher said, while acknowledging there is a ""huge amount of risk"" associated with the integration.

The Credit Suisse integration is expected to take around three to four years, excluding Credit Suisse's non-core investment bank portfolio. Kelleher said the bank expects to remain well capitalized and ""significantly above"" its capital targets by the time the deal closes. New UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti began his second tenure on Wednesday after his shock reappointment last week, with the board having decided that he was the right man to lead the mammoth task of integrating the bank's fallen compatriot's business. Ermotti's return was seen by many commentators as an attempt to restore calm, as the country's long-established reputation for financial stability teeters on the brink. UBS reported a full-year profit of $7.6 billion in 2022, and its shares remain up more than 10% since the turn of the year. Concerns remain over the scale of the new entity, which will have more than $5 trillion in total invested assets, and whether it creates too much concentrated risk for the Swiss and global economy.

Reports have suggested that UBS' plans may include job cuts of around 20-30% of the combined entity's global workforce, but the bank's Vice Chairman said Wednesday that it was too early to offer any concrete estimates. Credit Suisse held the final independent AGM in its 167-year history in Zurich on Tuesday, after Swiss authorities brokered an ""emergency rescue"" in late March, when the bank's share price tumbled and depositors fled en masse. The board was angrily confronted on Tuesday by shareholders demanding answers and accountability over the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.3 billion) deal, which was rushed through over the course of a weekend and denied both UBS and Credit Suisse shareholders a vote. Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann said he was ""truly sorry"" to shareholders, clients and employees, and suggested the bank's turnaround plan after years of losses, scandals and compliance failures had been on track until turmoil in the U.S. banking sector sparked a flight of confidence.

GENEVA, April 2 (Reuters) - The bank created by the UBS (UBSG.S) takeover of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) is poised to reduce its workforce by 20-30%, Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger reported on Sunday, citing an unnamed senior UBS manager.

UBS agreed to buy Zurich rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion) in a deal engineered by the Swiss government, the central bank and market regulator to avoid a meltdown in the country's financial system.

But the deal, which was also designed to help to secure financial stability globally, has raised concerns over the size of a new bank with $1.6 trillion in assets and more than 120,000 staff worldwide.

The report said the bank could cut about 11,000 jobs in Switzerland.

Jobs in its U.S. investment banking arm will also be affected, the report said, with UBS set for talks to terminate a deal that would have given Wall Street dealmaker Michael Klein control of much of Credit Suisse's investment bank.

ZURICH/BERN (Reuters) -Switzerland's tradition of dependable consensus politics has taken a battering after the government used an emergency law to push through a state-backed mega-merger of UBS and Credit Suisse, sidelining the country's parliament.

Switzerland's two parliamentary chambers voted to reject the government's 109 billion Swiss francs ($122.82 billion) in aid for the deal between the country's two biggest banks, delivering a slap in the face for government.

The defeat is symbolic as it cannot change the merger, but it is a blow for the government in an election year and makes it harder to build broad support among the population for the biggest corporate rescue in Swiss history.

The use of emergency laws, in which shareholders and parliamentarians have no say, will also damage the standing of Switzerland's financial industry abroad, analysts have said, especially as it faces rising competition from other financial centres like Singapore.

The Swiss political model is under pressure at the moment, said political scientist Michael Hermann, a director of pollsters Sotomo, adding that the foreign perception of Switzerland as business friendly and as a financial safe haven could be undermined.

""Legitimacy in Swiss politics has been weakened, People who worried about an over powerful government during COVID will see their fears confirmed,"" said Hermann.

""This is damaging for the trust in democracy – parliament says no, but the emergency credits still go through.""

A recent Sotomo poll showed two thirds of the population was against the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse, while a third of respondents were angry that emergency laws had been used to bypass parliament.

The affair has already boosted support for populist right wing groups like the anti-immigrant Swiss People's Party (SVP) and the libertarian Aufrecht Schweiz movement in local elections since the takeover. Both parties are looking to make gains in national elections in October.

PARLIAMENT 'CIRCUMVENTED'

The Credit Suisse/UBS merger marked the first time that parliament had withheld its support for emergency laws designed to deal quickly with crises.

The facility to act without parliamentary approval, introduced in 2000, was used during the COVID pandemic to enforce restrictions and again last year to provide a Swiss energy producer with a credit line.

In the lead-up to the UBS/Credit Suisse merger last month, Swiss emergency law allowed a sub-group of six members of parliament to approve a cabinet plan to give financial aid on behalf of the legislative body, angering the almost 250 lawmakers, who were left without a say.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter defended the use of the emergency powers, saying Switzerland was not an ""emergency dictatorship.""

""We don't do it for fun. We really didn't know what else to do,"" Keller-Sutter told parliament during a stormy emergency session this week. ""The emergency law is based on the federal constitution and I don't think it's correct to say it's illegal.""

Lawmakers were dismayed.

""It has not been a great moment for Swiss democracy. It is terrible parliament has been put in this position and basically circumvented,"" said Roger Nordmann, leader of the Social Democrat group in the Swiss lower house told Reuters.

The Swiss government said it would take into account the rejection by parliament, but stressed the success of the takeover of Switzerland's second biggest bank - intended to prevent a financial meltdown - was paramount.

Industry experts said the deal was unlikely to be changed by politicians, with UBS being given a free hand to determine how many jobs will go and what will be done with Credit Suisse's valuable domestic retail banking business.

Swiss media has reported that the takeover could result in the combined bank cutting its Swiss workforce by up to 30%, which could cost 11,000 jobs.

""Despite the anger, most policy-makers do not want to interfere in the merger, to create and bear the risk that the merger does not succeed,"" said Hans Gersbach, co-director of the KOF economic research institute at ETH Zurich.

""Politicians might have wanted to show their disapproval about what happened, but they don’t want the UBS takeover to fail.""

Ultimately, 209 billion Swiss francs are being provided as state and central bank guarantees and support in the plan drawn up by the seven-strong Swiss cabinet, which has members from four political parties.

The amount is equivalent to around a quarter of Switzerland's entire economic output, and includes emergency liquidity injections and a state pledge to absorb up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS, based on documents outlining the deal.

Peter Kunz, an expert in economic law at the University of Bern, said the lawmakers were ultimately powerless to change it.

""In Switzerland, we often pat ourselves on the back for having the oldest democracy in the world. Yet seven people decided on 250 billion francs of support, an unimaginably huge sum of money,"" he said.

""And the parliament has no say in the matter. The use of such emergency legislation, overturning antitrust rules, is a problem for Swiss democracy and rule of law. It calls Swiss democracy into question.""

The US Fed said that the UBS Group had sought its approval to the deal on March 22.

As part of the deal, UBS will provide the Fed with “an implementation plan” for combining the US businesses of the two firms. The plan will be updated quarterly and will include UBS’ obligations to comply with more stringent “enhanced prudential standards”, the Fed said on Friday.

In a statement, the US Fed said the plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution. As per rules, the US central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

Last month, after the sudden collapse of US-based Silicon Valley Bank, investors lost confidence in Credit Suisse, which is Switzerland’s largest bank. In a matter of few days, Swiss authorities announced that UBS would buy Credit Suisse to contain further banking turmoil after the global lender had come to the brink of collapse. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets. Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

Besides the US, UBS secured temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, according to a report in Reuters.

Earlier this month, UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said that the unexpected takeover of rival Credit Suisse a significant milestone for Switzerland and for the global financial industry, which carries a “huge amount of risk”.

Addressing the annual shareholder meeting on April 5, Kelleher said that the takeover will take at least three to four years to take shape, excluding Credit Suisse’s non-core investment bank portfolio, which will have more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Describing the transaction as ""the first merger of two globally systematically important banks,"" Kelleher said the takeover ""means a new beginning and huge opportunities ahead for the combined bank and for the Swiss financial center as a whole.""

“Having a clear vision and a sound strategy is important….This transaction is the first merger of two global systemically important banks. This is not in any way an easy deal to do and brings with it execution risk,” Kelleher said.

A day before, Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann, while addressing the last AGM of the flagship bank, apologised to the shareholders for failing to contain the crisis, which led to its closure. In an emotional speech at Credit Suisse's last annual general meeting, chairman Axel Lehmann spoke of being caught off guard, pain, bitterness, accumulated scandals, and the grief that remains.

ZURICH, April 8 (Reuters) - UBS's (UBSG.S) multi-billion state-sponsored takeover of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) should proceed smoothly without political obstructions, Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said in an interview published on Saturday.

The Swiss parliament is due to hold an extraordinary session next week to discuss the emergency merger engineered by the Swiss authorities after Credit Suisse came close to collapse.

Nearly 260 billion Swiss francs ($287 billion) of liquidity support and state guarantees have been offered to back the takeover and avoid a financial meltdown the bank's uncontrolled failure could have triggered.

""There is a merger agreement between UBS and CS, for its part the cabinet has made a commitment to the national bank to provide CS with liquidity in order to ensure stability,"" Keller-Sutter told newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft.

""The guarantee agreement with UBS is still being negotiated. In many committee meetings, I got the impression that politicians definitely don't want to jeopardise the takeover,"" she added.

""I don't see any stumbling blocks at the moment.""

Completing the merger was the highest priority, the minister said, who defended the government's intervention last month, which critics have said came too late and promised too much taxpayer support for a bank that paid out billions in bonuses to executives.

""The primary goal of the Federal Council was to ensure the stability of the Swiss economy and the Swiss financial center and to prevent an international financial crisis,"" she said.

""Under the circumstances, it was and is the best possible choice, which also places the least burden on the state and the taxpayer,"" Keller-Sutter said.

The new combined bank will have $1.6 trillion in assets - double the size of the entire Swiss economy - and more than 120,000 staff and Keller-Sutter said the structure of UBS would have to be considered in the future.

""UBS will have to hold more equity after the takeover. This will rather force them to shrink,"" Keller-Sutter said.

Switzerland's Competition Commission can also make recommendations, the minister added.

The risks to the taxpayer were also acceptable - even though the government could assume up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS by the takeover.

Keller-Sutter criticised the culture at Credit Suisse, which she said had set the wrong incentives and had not learned from previous scandals and prosecutions.

The minister also defended the writedown of AT1 bonds to zero, a controversial part of the rescue.

""These are high-risk bonds with high yields, sometimes over 9%,"" Keller-Sutter said. ""The prospectus for these bonds makes it clear that if a company claims indirect government aid, they can be written off.""

The special parliamentary session next week was important, she added, and a welcome opportunity to get to the truth of the Credit Suisse debacle.

""At the moment, parliament can 'only' advise on the commitment credit, but it also has the opportunity to comment on the case and play an active role in the process.""

2023-04-12 17:53:06 ET

Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( NYSE: GS ) down nearly 12% versus its year-to-date high is an opportunity for investors to build a position in this quality name, as per a UBS analyst.

Goldman Sachs stock should be worth $385

On Wednesday, Brennan Hawken upgraded the financial services behemoth to “buy” and raised his price target to $385 – about a 17% upside from here.

The analyst is constructive on Goldman Sachs stock because he’s convinced that its trading business could benefit from the recent bank failures.

GS has opportunity to accelerate growth of their asset and wealth management platform and their transactional banking business through attractively priced M&A, especially if stress in banking system presents further inorganic opportunities.

In January, Goldman Sachs said its trading revenue went up 16% (best among peers) in 2022 that helped offset a big hit to its revenue from investment banking.

Why else is he bullish on Goldman Sachs stock?

Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs confirmed that it was shrinking its loss-producing consumer business ( read more ). That could be a meaningful tailwind for the share price as well, Hawken added.

Other reasons cited for the bullish view on Goldman Sachs stock include the bank’s commitment to expanding its financing business. The analyst said in his research note:

As a [global systemically important bank], the firm is already subject to the highest capital requirements. So, while Basel 4 certainly could increase capital requirements, changes should be less significant than for regional banks.

Goldman Sachs is set to report its Q1 financial results next week. Consensus is for it to earn $8.53 a share this quarter versus $10.76 per share a year ago.

GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland’s parliament opened a special session Tuesday to scrutinize the state-imposed takeover of Swiss bank Credit Suisse by rival UBS — and consider strengthening the legal arsenal to better gird against financial blowups .

The debate could run up to three days, with lawmakers voicing — and needing to iron out — disagreements over the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.25 billion) fusion of Switzerland’s top two banks , a thunderclap for a country that prides itself on finesse and acumen in finance.

Swiss authorities stepped in as shares of Credit Suisse plunged last month and depositors pulled their money after the failure of two U.S. banks sparked concerns about the stability of global financial system and the long-troubled lender. Credit Suisse is among 30 “globally systemically important banks,” and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

“The situation on the financial markets has calmed down, but it is not fully stabilized, and our country — Switzerland — has emerged shaken by this painful episode ,” Swiss President Alain Berset said at the session.

He said lawmakers would need to ensure that the legal framework was “as solid as possible to prevent this kind of crisis from happening again.” The executive branch also would look into “too big to fail” rules for key banks passed after the 2008 global financial crisis that may need changing, Berset added.

Lawmakers also are considering accountability for Credit Suisse and concerns about thousands of expected job cuts and looking at state-backed guarantees of over $100 billion aimed at holding the bank together until the merger is completed and buttressing UBS against possible losses .

They also are debating what it will mean for Switzerland to have one giant bank .

Johanna Gapany, a centrist lawmaker and rapporteur for the upper chamber’s finance commission, said the parliamentary panel had made three main proposals: change competition rules in light of the emergence of megabank UBS , examine how Credit Suisse executives might be held accountable and block the executive branch from unilaterally releasing more emergency funds for the rescue plan.

The proposals showed a “clear intention to not only prevent this situation from happening again, but to make sure that the solution protects the interests of citizens as much as possible — thus by taking the least risk with the guarantees that have been provided,” Gapany said.

ADVERTISEMENT

Despite the talk, few concrete results were expected from the session, which is primarily to flesh out ideas — and possibly some vitriol — from lawmakers who all face reelection this fall.

Yvan Lengwiler, an economics professor at the University of Basel, suggested that the debate would play into a longtime “tug-of-war” between lawmakers who have lobbied in favor of Swiss banks over the years and others who have long sought to stiffen regulation.

“It seems that the pendulum, after this debacle we’ve seen, has clearly shifted towards strengthening,” he said. “Two years from now … the political situation might be very different, and it could be quite difficult to get this through parliament.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Jakob Stark, an upper-house lawmaker from the populist, right-wing Swiss People’s Party, said the rescue of Credit Suisse was “was probably right and ultimately unavoidable” but that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority — known as FINMA — must become ”more decisive.”

“It should, for instance, get the authority to impose fines, but then it should also really impose the fines, and particularly on the big institutions,” Stark said of the regulator. “My feeling is that it was too considerate toward Credit Suisse, perhaps because of a legal basis that wasn’t sufficiently clear.”

The Swiss attorney general’s office has already opened a probe into events surrounding Credit Suisse ahead of the takeover, and the executive branch last week ordered tens of millions in cuts to the bonuses of top Credit Suisse executives.

Lawmakers largely were expected to line up behind the rescue plan — even if reluctantly for some — and were not yet expected to authorize a parliamentary investigation of the epochal rescue of Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old pillar of Swiss banking.

ADVERTISEMENT

Lengwiler, who specializes in financial market regulation, noted that the combined bank will have a balance sheet that will be twice as large as Switzerland’s annual economy.

That’s nothing new: Both Credit Suisse and UBS had bigger balance sheets than the Swiss economy before the 2008 financial crisis. But this combined bank will be unprecedented in size and heft, presenting new challenges for government officials.

“What’s new here is that it’s the only kid on the block now,” Lengwiler said. “UBS is really the only game in town and … has become extremely dominant, and that is a problem for Switzerland.”

“It’s maybe too large for the country,” he added.

- Finally taking a look at Microsoft shares, closing the day in the red, off just over 2%. UBS warning of further troubles in the cloud sector. Analyst, Karl Kersten, saying that he wrote in a note to clients that quote, ""Customer efforts to optimize or trim their cloud spend will be deeper and last longer than most things."" Now key cloud companies lagging behind today, along with Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Snowflake, all moving to the downside. Weakness in the cloud was something we started to hear about during last earnings season, Josh, when we started to see some of these larger names post smaller growth numbers. That was clearly concern there for analysts at the time. It looks like it might be a little bit longer of a runway here until we start to see things turn around.

- Yeah, UBS talked to over 20 different large consumers of these products, and I thought it was interesting to see that they had seen a more of a tick down since they last talked to them three months ago. You noted that AWS and Azure, we had already seen a slowdown. So to continue to see that slowdown will be interesting to see how that translates to earnings in a couple of weeks. Their specific point on Microsoft I thought was interesting, too, Seana, talking about just the Microsoft stock price we're showing. They're up almost 20% year to date.

And their argument for Microsoft basically being that AI unit is already priced in. So you already have the price in there with that 20% bump. Now you're looking at a Azure, which was sort of the growth story before, and that might be slowing down. So then what does that mean for the outlook of Microsoft? It gets a little bit murkier when we get outside that AI hype train. Although, it is pretty exciting.

- It is exciting. I know, AI was certainly the buzzword of last earnings season. We'll see whether or not that's a tech buzz word of this earnings season. You got to think a lot of these companies are going to be mentioning that quite a few times, right, Josh? Great job. Thanks so much.",[],

GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland’s lower house of parliament issued a searing — though symbolic — rebuke Wednesday of an emergency plan spearheaded by the executive branch to prop up embattled Credit Suisse and shepherd it into a takeover by Swiss banking rival UBS .

The National Council, through an unusual left-right alliance, voted twice over the last day to reject government guarantees authorized last month of 100 billion Swiss francs (about $110 billion) to help keep Credit Suisse afloat and 9 billion francs to help UBS mop up any losses it may incur in the deal.

The votes took place in a special parliamentary session that wrapped up Wednesday to scrutinize long-running troubles at Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old bank that was a pillar of Swiss finance, and the government plan to save it from a collapse that could have shaken the global financial system.

Switzerland’s main right-wing party opposed tighter regulations on banks, while centrists favored tougher rules but would accept state help for banks in some cases. Left-leaning parties that have long decried “overly dangerous” banks were insistent on stricter limits on bonuses for top executives and requirements for more money to be kept on hand by the biggest lenders.

“The whole discussion centered on whether more regulation was needed — in particular to the leverage ratio — and severely regulate bonuses of the managers of the big, systemically important banks,” Socialist lawmaker Roger Nordmann said.

Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter, who has been at the epicenter of a political firestorm around the 3 billion franc ($3.25 billion) Credit Suisse-UBS deal , told lawmakers that capital requirements would be increased — and “you can start from the premise that big banks will face more severe restrictions.”

But Nordmann, who had questioned the minister on that issue, said by phone that Keller-Sutter hadn’t presented any clear measures and was too noncommittal.

“That’s an invitation for all dishonest bankers to come to Switzerland, and what we need is honest people,” he said.

The votes were symbolic because a parliamentary commission has already signed on to the emergency rescue plan that Swiss authorities orchestrated last month as shares of Credit Suisse sank and customers rushed to pull out their money. The failure of two U.S. banks just days before had sparked concerns about the stability of the Swiss lender and the global financial system.

Both the Swiss central bank and the government splashed out more than 200 billion Swiss francs in guarantees to help underpin the fusion of the country’s top two banks and keep Credit Suisse from failing.

Parliament’s upper house had voted Tuesday to accept the takeover plan announced March 19 by Switzerland’s seven-member executive branch — known as the Federal Council, which is headed by the Swiss president — as well as the Swiss National Bank and the financial markets regulator, FINMA.

Lawmakers in the upper house backed a plan that would have included limits to bonuses for bankers, but it didn’t go far enough for the lower house.

However, he said it would be business as usual in the short-term.Sources told TOI that Cognizant , TCS and Wipro have deals with Credit Suisse amounting collectively to as much as $350-$400 million annually. The remaining slice of the outsourcing pie is shared between Infosys, Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech. “It’s good to assume there will be change. The way that regulators structured the deal (UBS taking over Credit Suisse), has brought in stability. All the existing work that's being done in countries - -technology, and operations all of that is continuing as business as usual. In two quarters, we will pitch to them (UBS) how they can leverage synergies. I don't know whether there will be an impact in the short term, but in the medium to long term, there will be an impact,” he said. He expects more business from the integration for tech players.Both Credit Suisse and UBS have a significant presence in India through their tech centres. As of December, UBS had 22% of its 74,000 employees in Asia Pacific, and India is a big part of its tech operations.TCS signed $10 billion total contract value in the March quarter, which is the highest quarterly TCV in the last financial year. Out of which $3 billion came from banking and financial services. “After the SVB collapse, customers became a bit tentative. What’s the noise out there? We want to do projects but let’s spend wisely. Our incremental revenue of over $1 billion which is the size of a startup or a small firm. If they don't do anything in six months given the pace at which technology changes, they will become a legacy company very quickly. So, they have deferred a few projects which have impacted our revenue,” he said. TCS’s revenue grew a modest 0.6% in constant currency in the quarter compared to the preceding one, outweighed by weak cues in banking and financial services.Subramaniam said banks are focusing on cost optimization by simplifying the organization and across the ecosystem in which they operate. “The whole approach is to kill reconciliation. In each bank, there are thousands of people doing reconciliation work in the back office. We don’t need them if you optimise using tech. With newer technologies like generative AI, there are opportunities to co-innovate and cocreate,” he added.In the 2023-24 financial year, large banks across North America, Europe or the UK seem to be pressing ahead with tech spending, but they seem to be watchful. “There are no cancellations, barring central Europe, where it's tentative. The Nordics are doing well. There are some green shoots emerging. We are navigating uncertainty with the right level of optics,” he added.Many deals are in the $50-100 million range. In the March quarter, TCS won a $700 million deal from UK's largest long-term savings and retirement provider Phoenix in the March quarter. “If we have one or two mega deals in a year, it's good. Large deals are susceptible to problems -- it takes 4-5 years to execute and management and tech changes will be there,” he added.Subramaniam said he doesn’t anticipate the chain reaction that was pronounced in the banking and financial services space during the recession. When asked about CEO designate K Krithivasan successor to take over BFSI sector, he said, “There are a lot of candidates and we’re not in a hurry.”Subramaniam said fresher additions of over 40,000 in the 2024 fiscal is intact, but lateral hiring is need-based. We have a strong bench and we have enough capacity. We have more than 2 lakh employees over ten years and above in TCS that we need to leverage,” he said.TCS , he said, would be rolling out 15-20% hikes for top performers, 10-15% for good performers and 5-7% for average performers. “We have rolled out hikes effective April 1 And gave 100% variable pay last quarter. It’s safe to assume average hikes will be in the range of 8-12%,” he said.",[],

Investors are still struggling to make sense of the US labor market, he added.

It's going to remain tricky for investors to pick stocks for the rest of this year because markets are still hooked on unpredictable economic data, according to UBS.

The Swiss bank's CIO Mark Haefele expects the choppiness stocks seen in the early months of 2023 to continue, thanks to traders' fixation on the rate of inflation and unemployment.

""So far, 2023 has been a much better year for asset class returns, with the S&P 500 up 7.5% year-to-date, but has been characterized by ever-changing market narratives,"" Haefele wrote in a note Wednesday.

The investment chief was referring to the benchmark US stock index's rebound this year from a plunge of 18% in 2022.

""The potential remains for this data-dependent market to keep jumping from one narrative to another for the rest of the year,"" he added. ""This should make it difficult for investors to navigate the coming months.""

The note comes ahead of the release later Wednesday of the monthly Consumer Price Index report, which will show how much US inflation rose in March. His bank believes the CPI will come in at 5.1% — down from 6% in February, but still far off the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

Markets will stay unpredictable even if inflation cools for a ninth month in a row, according to Haefele, because investors are still struggling to make sense of the US labor market.

Friday's nonfarm payrolls report showed the US economy added 236,000 jobs in March, its lowest print since December 2020. Investors are divided on whether that's good or bad news.

""While the optimistic interpretation of this data is that the tightness in the labor market is easing as the balance of supply and demand of labor improves, the pessimists view it as the first cracks that could be followed by much greater deterioration in the coming months,"" Haefele said.

Worries about an economic slowdown could soon replace inflation tracking as a key focus, UBS's investment chief added.

Economists have warned that the Fed's year of aggressive interest-rate hikes will likely soon start weighing on growth – and that slowdown could drag on stocks by chipping away at listed companies' earnings.

""As inflation eases, growth may take over as the more dominant concern, perceived or otherwise,"" Haefele said.

""The optics of a decline in headline CPI to 3% may reinforce the view that growth, rather than inflation, will be driving Fed decisions and the market's performance,"" he added.

The Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors approved on Friday UBS Group AG’s buyout of the US subsidiaries of Credit Suisse, clearing another major hurdle for the completion of the Swiss-brokered rescue deal.

UBS has committed to give the US central bank an implementation plan for combining its US business and operations with those of Credit Suisse within three months of consummating the deal, the Fed’s Board said in a statement. The plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution, the statement said.

The US central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion (CHF223 billion) of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

UBS had requested the Fed’s approval of the merger on March 22, the Fed said.

After years of scandal and losses, 167-year-old Credit Suisse came to the brink of collapse before Zurich-based rival UBS rode to the rescue with a merger engineered and bankrolled by the Swiss authorities last month. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

The Swiss authorities and UBS Group AG have been racing to close the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG within as little as a month, in an effort to retain the lender’s clients and employees, Reuters previously reported.

UBS secured a temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, people familiar with the process told Reuters.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

The Fed subjects firms with more than $700 billion in assets, or more than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activities, to heightened supervision, including annual company-run stress tests and increased liquidity standards.

International backing On Friday, Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said in Washington that “it was recognised at the international level that the solution found [by Switzerland] had helped to avoid an international financial crisis”. Keller-Sutter was in the US capital for meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. She also commented on the rejection of the deal by the Swiss parliament this week, which she said would have “no consequence” on the takeover being completed. Swiss National Bank President Thomas Jordan also said on Friday that his counterparts had welcomed the fast action of the Swiss government, which had prevented the Alpine Nation becoming “the first domino in a systemic crisis”. For the BNS boss, the goal now is to successfully complete the merger of the two banks: “only this will create the necessary stability”, he said. At that point, laws around “too big to fail” banks can be revised and updated to reflect lessons learned. End of insertion

The Pound to Australian Dollar exchange rate (GBP/AUD) could be prone to near-term weakness according to a new assessment from strategists at UBS.

""This week, we recommend going long the Australian dollar versus the British pound,"" says Thomas Flury, Strategist at UBS Switzerland AG.

The call comes following a period of relative underperformance by the Australian Dollar against most of its G10 contemporaries.

This underperformance includes a 1.22% loss against the Australian Dollar over the course of the past month that extends to over 4.0% for 2023 as a whole.

""AUD has lagged some other G10 currencies recently in the broad USD decline, due to an early pause from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and some weaker labour data in January, which sparked a widening of Australia’s yield discount,"" says Flury.

The RBA opted to maintain rates at 3.6% and said its decision provides the Board with more time to assess the state of the economy and the outlook.

However, UBS strategists note Aussie labour data have strengthened again of late and consumer confidence rebounded with house prices ticking higher in March.

The Australian dollar rose against other major currencies on Thursday, April 13 following the release of better-than-expected labour market data.

Australia's employment grew by 53K jobs in March according to the latest Labour Force survey, surpassing market expectations of 20K.

The unemployment rate remained steady at 3.5%, defying expectations of a slight increase to 3.6%.

As a result of the better-than-expected numbers, the Australian dollar was the strongest-performing G10 currency on Thursday.

The developments lead UBS currency strategists to assess that at least two further hikes are now likely from the RBA.

Looking at the Pound Sterling element of the GBP/AUD pair, Flury notes the UK economy faces multiple headwinds in 2023 despite lower energy prices.

""The Bank of England is expected to pause its tightening cycle, while the RBA likely still has one if not two hikes to go, and these are not currently fully priced in yet,"" says Flury.

The China-sensitive Aussie Dollar is also expected to benefit as the recovery in the world's second-largest economy is expected to build over the second quarter of 2023.

UBS notes credit and housing data out of China signals a quicker rebound.

Analysts also note an improvement in relations between China and Australia as disputes over tariffs on some exports could be resolved and thermal coal shipments are again on the rise.

""The AUD has greater leverage to these dynamics, so we see both fundamental and technical reasons to be long AUDGBP,"" says Flury.

https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ubs-names-sergio-ermotti-new-ceo-president-2023-03-29/,Sergio Ermotti returns as UBS CEO to steer Credit Suisse takeover,"Summary

Summary Companies Swiss banker Ermotti was UBS CEO 2011 to 2020

UBS agreed rescue takeover of rival this month

Analysts, some shareholders welcome Ermotti's return















ZURICH, March 29 (Reuters) - UBS Group AG (UBSG.S) has rehired Sergio Ermotti as CEO to steer its massive takeover of neighbour Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) - a surprise move to take advantage of the Swiss banker's experience rebuilding the bank after the global financial crisis.

The trader turned corporate problem fixer faces the tough challenge of laying off thousands of staff, cutting back Credit Suisse's investment bank and reassuring the world's wealthy that UBS remains a safe harbour for their cash.

""We felt we had a better horse,"" said UBS chairman Colm Kelleher of the decision to replace current CEO Ralph Hamers after less than three years in charge.

Kelleher said he brought back Ermotti because he was best equipped to see through the biggest deal in finance since the global banking crash more than a decade ago.

""This is not a Swiss solution,"" he said, seeking to play down any role of Ermotti's nationality in getting the job, and instead emphasised his focus was on the large risks of making the merger work for UBS.

""Being Swiss helps,"" Kelleher said. ""But the majority of our business is global.""

Ermotti, who was chief executive of UBS from 2011 to 2020 and is now chairman of Swiss Re (SRENH.S), will take the helm from April 5. The 62-year old is credited with executing UBS's turnaround after a series of scandals and losses nearly caused the bank's implosion.

He made a plea on Wednesday for ""a little bit of patience"" over a ""couple of months"" to allow the bank to forge its strategic plan. ""We cannot rush into decisions which are regrettable,"" he told journalists.

He said he had returned to UBS after feeling what he termed ""a call of duty"" and added he had always wanted to be involved in a massive transaction like the takeover of Credit Suisse.

He takes charge weeks after UBS bought its Swiss rival in a shotgun merger engineered by Swiss authorities to stem turmoil after Credit Suisse ran aground.

That deal makes UBS Switzerland's one and only global bank, underpinned by roughly 260 billion francs ($283 billion) in state loans and guarantees, a risky bet that makes the Swiss economy more dependent on a single lender.

In a reminder of how UBS will be inheriting some of Credit Suisse's troubles, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee found on Wednesday the bank had violated a 2014 tax evasion deal and said its new owners or the Swiss government should assume responsibility for any future fines.

Still, UBS shares rose 3.6% on Wednesday, beating the Swiss blue chip index's (.SSMI) 1.2% gain.

HAMERS HANDS OVER REINS

Analysts said Ermotti's experience paring back UBS's investment bank after the 2008 financial crash made him well equipped for the job.

""The decision to bring back Sergio Ermotti is very positive as it reduces integration and execution risk by 80%,"" said Davide Serra, CEO of Algebris Investments.

""Sergio has already reduced risk and made the investment bank serve its clients and not its investment bankers as Credit Suisse did. As a shareholder and bondholder I am very happy,"" he added.

Reuters Graphics

Ermotti had earlier described the task of integrating UBS and Credit Suisse as ""urgent and challenging"".

Outgoing CEO Hamers, who had succeeded Ermotti in November 2020, ""has agreed to step down to serve the interests of the new combination ... and the country,"" UBS said.

Hamers, who will stay on as an adviser, had no big-ticket M&A experience under his belt and faced the task of combining two banks with $1.6 trillion in assets, more than 120,000 staff and a complex balance sheet.

The Dutch executive was a notable absentee from the announcement of UBS's takeover of Credit Suisse on March 19. The next day, Hamers looked bleary eyed as he described the end of Credit Suisse as a ""sad day"" that nobody wanted.

A nearly 30-year veteran of Dutch lender ING, Hamers was a surprise choice when he was appointed to lead UBS, as he had little experience in investment banking or wealth management.

https://www.finews.com/news/english-news/56827-credit-suisse-integration-ubs-jobs-employees-staff-culture-brand-image-english,Credit Suisse Employees Have Mentally Checked Out,"Employees feel increasingly lost and helpless. Hastily convened town halls and virtual meetings with senior executives do little to break a growing apathy.



Swiss bank employees have never faced anything like it. An almost unbelievable sense of helplessness following UBS's forced rescue of Credit Suisse. One employee at the Uetlihof, where 8,500 Credit Suisse staff are based, keeps it simple.

«Who wants to settle a mortgage or a corporate loan with us – or open an account», the employee frets.

So many things are still out there in the open. Among them, it is unclear who will be managing the relationship if the client had an account at both major Swiss banks. As one example of many, certain corporate clients who diversified their business risks by apportioning business between UBS and Credit Suisse are likely to choose one of the two in the future.

Thousand Cuts

«People have started to check out mentally», says the employee, noting the growing apathy at the bank. Hastily convened town halls and virtual meetings with senior executives do little to help. «They (management) talk a great deal but they say nothing when it comes down to it», the employee maintains, «as nobody really ostensibly knows anything.»

Lukas Gaehwiler's statement at the UBS annual general meeting last week has added to the general confusion. There, the vice chairman of Switzerland's largest bank, indicated that fully consolidating both entities in Switzerland could take up to three to four years. That would mean that the Credit Suisse brand would continue to exist for at least that amount of time. Many Credit Suisse employees took it akin to a death by a thousand cuts.

Cultural Filter



The situation was made even more difficult last week during the extraordinary session of the Swiss Federal Parliament in Berne when the Lower House twice rejected the emergency loans that were a key part of the deal. If anything, it is likely to delay future integration. «Do what you still need to do and do it as best as you possibly can and talk about it», are what some Credit Suisse team heads are indicating to their subordinates, «that is how you can best recommend yourself to your future employer.»

UBS chairman Colm Kelleher talked about a cultural «filter» during the appointment of Sergio Ermotti as the CEO of the new bank. It is a gauntlet Credit Suisse employees are going to have to run in the future combined entity. But the fear of somehow importing Credit Suisse culture, now clearly regarded as disastrous in hindsight, could prompt the decision makers at UBS to be particularly conservative. They may even veer away from the so-called one-third rule, according to a Zurich-based headhunter requesting anonymity given they are currently in touch with both banks.

Never Seen Before



The usual script for takeovers foresees the buyer taking in at least one-third of the employees of the entity that is being acquired, says Reto Jauch, the managing partner at the Zurich-based executive search firm Schulthess, Zimmermann & Jauch. That is in order to ensure that the new organization is functional from the outset.

Whatever the case, the cultural challenges of the deal are herculean. UBS is in the middle of transforming itself into an agile bank, which has been one of the main strategic imperatives of still CEO Ralph Hamers all the while Credit Suisse has been attempting to reform its risk culture from the ground up. Now, instead, in absolutely no time at all, both institutes are expected to consolidate their businesses into one. It is something that few have any experience or expertise within Switzerland, and certainly not on that scale.

No Consideration

Many experts agree that UBS has to act quickly. Otherwise, uncertainty will remain high, and that is something that will have an impact on the daily conduct of business. As employers, they have to provide clarity. The Zurich-based headhunter believes, however, that, despite that, they will show little consideration when it comes to job cuts: «Management knows that the public outcry will be short-lived but that the consequences from any overly tepid implementation could be very long and arduous», she indicates.

Employees that can quickly adapt to the new culture and outwardly represent it operationally will be chosen over others. Things look far less clear for bankers that have no direct contact with clients. UBS's takeover of Credit Suisse will also result in a great deal of management capacity entering the labor markets, says Jauch. «The Swiss bank sector will not be able to absorb this as it has in the past.»

Positive Aspects



According to brand expert, Florin Baeriswyl, it is important to communicate UBS's values and cultures to team members while also respecting the old Credit Suisse culture «for example, the values that Credit Suisse brings to the table as a bank for entrepreneurs». This needs to happen despite the current pressure on everyone.

«It is important to remember that a brand never belongs to one person or one company. The reputation of a brand is what people say about you when you are not in the room», Baeriswyl says. That is why, according to him, companies have to create a strong and credible image, something that both employees and clients can vouch for – and something that leaves a strong impression behind.

Banking giant UBS is buying its smaller rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion, in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in global banking.

GENEVA (AP) — Banking giant UBS is buying troubled rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion, in a deal orchestrated by regulators in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in the global banking system.

Swiss authorities pushed for UBS to take over its smaller rival after a plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and the bank’s customers. Shares of Credit Suisse and other banks plunged this week after the failure of two banks in the U.S. sparked concerns about other potentially shaky institutions in the global financial system.

Credit Suisse is among the 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

The deal was “one of great breadth for the stability of international finance,” said Swiss President Alain Berset as he announced it Sunday night. “An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Switzerland’s executive branch, a seven-member governing body that includes Berset, passed an emergency ordinance allowing the merger to go through without shareholder approval.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann called the sale “a clear turning point.”

“It is a historic, sad and very challenging day for Credit Suisse, for Switzerland and for the global financial markets,” Lehmann said, adding that the focus is now on the future and in particular on the 50,000 Credit Suisse employees, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland.

Following news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated financial moves to stabilize banks in the coming week. This includes daily access to a lending facility for banks looking to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice which widely used during the 2008 financial crisis. Three months after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September of 2008, such swap lines had been tapped for $580 billion. Added swap lines were also rolled out during market turmoil in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in March of 2020.

“Today is one of the most significant days in European banking since 2008, with far-reaching repercussions for the industry,” said Max Georgiou, an analyst at Third Bridge. “These events could alter the course of not only European banking but also the wealth management industry more generally.”

Colm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed the “enormous opportunities” that emerge from the takeover, and highlighted his bank’s “conservative risk culture” — a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse’s reputation for more swashbuckling, aggressive gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said the council “regrets that the bank, which was once a model institution in Switzerland and part of our strong location, was able to get into this situation at all.”

The combination of the two biggest and best-known Swiss banks, each with storied histories dating to the mid-19th century, amounts to a thunderclap for Switzerland’s reputation as a global financial center — leaving it on the cusp of having a single national champion in banking.

The deal follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further panic. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse’s share price began plummeting this week.

ADVERTISEMENT

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde lauded the “swift action” by Swiss officials, saying they were “instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.”

She said the banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.

UBS officials said they plan to sell off parts of Credit Suisse or reduce the bank’s size in the coming months and years.

The Swiss government is providing more than 100 billion francs in aid and financial backstops to make the deal go through.

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out. European bank regulators use a special type of bond designed to provide a capital cushion to banks in times of distress. But these bonds are designed to be wiped out if a bank’s capital falls below a certain level, which was triggered as part of this government-brokered deal.

Berset said the Federal Council had already been discussing a long-troubled situation at Credit Suisse since the beginning of the year and held urgent meetings in the last four days amid spiraling concerns about its financial health that caused major swoons in its stock price and raised the specter of the 2007-08 financial crisis.

Investors and banking industry analysts were still digesting the deal, but at least one analyst was sour on the news because it could damage Switzerland’s global banking image.

“A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,” said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas LLC, in an email.

Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

The Credit Suisse parent bank is not part of European Union supervision, but it has entities in several European countries that are. Lagarde reiterated what she said last week after the central bank raised interest rates — that the European banking sector is resilient, with strong financial reserves and plenty of ready cash.

Many of Credit Suisse’s problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve . As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.

The deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn’t invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.

On Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.

Its current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.

While smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.

The Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds , repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann on Tuesday told shareholders he was ""truly sorry"" for the collapse that led to the bank's controversial takeover by UBS . ""It is a sad day for you and for us too. I can understand the bitterness, the anger and the shock of all those who are disappointed, overwhelmed and affected by the developments,"" Lehmann said at the bank's annual meeting, the first time its leaders have addressed the public since the rescue. ""I apologize that we were no longer able to stem the loss of trust that had accumulated over the years, and for disappointing you."" A police presence was established early Tuesday at the venue, as protesters and shareholders began arriving in droves, hoping for answers and accountability following the demise of the 167-year-old Swiss institution. A number of shareholders took to the stage over the course of the morning to lambast the bank's leadership and demand further explanation of the process and reasoning behind the deal. Swiss authorities brokered an emergency rescue of the stricken bank by its larger domestic rival for just 3 billion Swiss francs, over the course of a weekend in late March. It followed a collapse in Credit Suisse's deposits and share price amid fears of a global banking crisis, but the deal remains mired in legal and logistical challenges. Neither UBS nor Credit Suisse shareholders were allowed a vote on the deal.

""The merger had to go through."" At 2 p.m. London time, Lehmann was re-elected as chairman until the completion of the merger, winning 55.67% of shareholder votes. The remaining board members were narrowly re-elected, with the exception of five that did not stand again. In a statement Sunday, the office of the attorney general confirmed that Switzerland's Federal Prosecutor is investigating potential breaches of Swiss federal law by government officials, regulators and top executives at Credit Suisse and UBS. Both banks declined to comment on Monday. 'We ran out of time' Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Koerner took over in 2021, when the bank was reeling from a series of high-profile scandals, risk management failures and heavy losses. In October 2022, Credit Suisse launched a massive strategic overhaul, aimed at fixing its risk and compliance culture and addressing perennial underperformance in the investment bank. Koerner told shareholders on Tuesday that he returned to Credit Suisse in 2021 hoping to ""tackle the problems that existed and build a new Credit Suisse."" ""In short, I wanted to create an organization that our shareholders, our clients and all our employees could be proud of. Unfortunately, we didn't succeed in the end. We ran out of time. This fills me with sorrow,"" he said. ""What has happened over the past few weeks will continue to affect me personally and many others for a long time to come.""

Commentators have highlighted the importance of the deal's success for Swiss authorities against a febrile political backdrop. The lack of input from shareholders, bondholders and Swiss taxpayers in UBS' acquisition of its embattled rival has sparked widespread anger. Speaking outside the annual meeting, Vincent Kaufmann, CEO of Ethos Foundation which represents pension funds comprising between 3% and 5% of Credit Suisse shareholders, told CNBC that they had ""lost a lot of money"" and ""need to know what management is doing."" Potential courses of action include ""trying to retrieve some of the viable pay that was granted for former management, who may have failed in their duties to protect shareholders' interests,"" he said. ""We're still looking for possibilities — it's quite difficult with the Swiss company law to prove the damage. Mismanagement of a company is not per se something we can concretely act against former members of the management or current members of the management, but still we need to be sure that they gave the whole truth to investors and to the market, so there is still open question,"" Kaufmann told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche. Holders of Credit Suisse's AT1 bond instruments, which were subject to a $17 billion wipeout as part of the UBS takeover, last week instructed a global law firm to pursue discussion and possible litigation with Swiss authorities.

The company, which now has around one-third of its employees based in the U.S., inked its most high-profile stateside deal by putting the UBS name on the Isles’ arena as part of a 20-year pact. “It was an opportunity for us to demonstrate and accelerate our commitment and presence in the U.S.,” said Mesilati. “We viewed that this would be a highly visible destination for visitors across the globe, but also from the New York area, which is extremely important for our ultra-high net worth clients.” Mesilati also noted the timing of the deal, signed in July 2020, meant UBS was taking something of a chance on the bounceback of the live fan experience. “It was very counterintuitive to enter into a naming rights agreement in the middle of a global pandemic,” she said. “But we always had absolute confidence.”

STRONG AS OAK: One key area of collaboration between UBS and the Islanders at the local level has come in the form of the 43 Oak Foundation, a DEI-driven youth hockey program that UBS and the Islanders have pledged $1M toward over a five-year period. The effort, which has seen involvement from both Islanders and UBS execs, focuses on bringing down barriers to playing hockey for underprivileged and minority athletes, serving primarily N.Y. metro area players ages 12-22 by providing transportation, equipment, ice time, funding for travel and other resources -- not to mention mentorship from both Islanders and UBS senior execs. “We work very closely with the players on career development, interview skills,” Mesilati noted when talking about off-ice efforts within the program. “We can have generational impact there.” Participation in the initiative has grown 500% since its start, and has even expanded beyond the N.Y. metro area.

WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Another key sports sponsorship pact for UBS is with the Mercedes F1 team, which counts Lewis Hamilton and George Russell as drivers. Mesilati said the growth of F1 in the U.S. has “extremely important” to UBS -- something she attributed to the popularity of “Drive to Survive” on Netflix. “Miami is a core market for UBS,” Mesilati noted when discussing the race that debuted on the grounds of Hard Rock Stadium last year. “We have a huge percentage of our business in the Miami area. We were extremely over-subscribed. Huge amount of demand from our clients. … We cannot wait for Vegas. … It will be a huge platform for us.” UBS around two years ago also began sponsoring shows on streaming service PlayersTV to promote its wealth management services. That included “Front Office,” a Chris Paul-backed show focused on athlete entrepreneurs such as Michelle Wie, Mookie Betts and Travis Kelce. Two other shows -- “Long Game” and “Level Up” -- are hosted by former NFLer and current UBS exec Wale Ogunleye. “It really worked for us because it enabled a way for us to authentically engage with athletes,” said Mesilati.",[],2023-04-10 00:00:00

We would be buyers on this weakness if we were not restricted. Jim Cramer said on the Club's Morning Meeting that FL is a ""strong buy."" Part of call from UBS is related to a higher conviction in a consumer spending slowdown that could cause the U.S. softline retail industry's earnings outlook to deteriorate and pressure earnings. The analysts cite proprietary research data about spending intentions and the recent banking turmoil as reasons for the increased conviction in their sector call. While there remains a lot of uncertainty about the health of the consumer and it will take time to fully understand how much credit conditions tightened from what happened to the banks, our main issue with the FL sell call is that completely ignores the main points of the company's ""Lace Up"" turnaround strategy that was unveiled last week. One reason why UBS says Foot Locker is challenged is that it thinks Nike (NKE) as a percentage of Foot Locker sales will decline to 55% to 60% from 70% over the next 12 to 18 months. UBS doubts it will ever reach 70% again. Our problem with this is that the decline in the mix isn't purely a function of selling less Nike. Foot Locker plans to grow its non-Nike sales by more than double the company average through 2026 by leveraging brand partnerships with companies like ON Running, Hoka, New Balance, ASICS, and Crocs. Don't forget: CEO Mary Dillon formerly ran Ulta Beauty (ULTA). Her expertise is in developing brand partnerships across several different companies, and that's essential for a multi-brand retailer like Foot Locker. If there is a retail executive who can navigate the Nike partnership while building up the rest of the business, it is her. Another issue we see in the UBS downgrades is its fiscal year 2026 margin target of around 5%. This completely goes against management's target of 8.5% to 9%. Of course, this is only a target and it must be scrutinized because sometimes management teams aim high and miss. FL YTD mountain YTD performance However, Foot Locker's target has some credibility because margins will go higher as a result of the company closing 400 underperforming stores, exiting money-losing brands like Sidestep in Europe, and transitioning most of its Asia business model out of unprofitable owned stores and to a profitable licensing stream. These actions will be margin accretive over the long term. And if we needed one more reason to believe share are attractive now, we got it Tuesday after it was disclosed in a filing that CEO Mary Dillon purchased about half a million dollars' worth of shares at $39.74. Company executives may sell their stock for all kinds of reasons – they could be buying a house, it could be to pay off taxes, or it could be based on their view on the stock. But insiders buy stock for only one reason – to make money because they think the stock is going higher. Between UBS who put a sell on Foot Locker vs. CEO Mary Dillon who just bought stock, we'll side with the seasoned executive who just kicked off a turnaround plan. And with shares trading at a low 11 times forward multiple with a 4.0% dividend yield, we like the risk-reward down at these levels. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long FL.

Five to twelve ""fuenf vor zwoelf"" is written on a clock next to a logo of the Swiss bank Credit Suisse, in Zurich, Switzerland, Monday, March 20, 2023.

(Ennio Leanza/Keystone via AP)

LONDON (AP) — Credit Suisse shares plunged Monday after Swiss authorities cut a deal with its bigger rival UBS to acquire the troubled bank at a marked-down price. But European bank stocks and the wider market gained as investors watch whether moves to shore up banks will stem further upheaval in the global financial system .

Shares of Credit Suisse , whose woes stem from questions over its internal controls, closed nearly 56% lower a day after UBS said it would buy its fellow Swiss bank for a lowball price of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion). The shares traded at about the level they are valued at in the deal.

Swiss regulators orchestrated the purchase in a bid to stop more turmoil after the collapse of two U.S. banks . In an indication of the frantic, behind-the-scenes deal-making to resolve the issue before markets opened, the acquisition was announced late Sunday.

There is still uncertainty over how the deal will play out for the combined lender and what comes next for the wider banking system. Analysts say some previous forced bank mergers didn’t work out well for shareholders in the long run.

It could be that no more banks get into trouble, but it’s also possible that “we just go from one weak institution falling over to the next,” said Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser at Capital Economics.

There no other obvious candidates that could be singled out like Credit Suisse, but it’s “hard to predict where the problems will emerge,” she said.

UBS shares initially dropped on the Swiss stock exchange but closed up 1.3%. The deal whipsawed other European bank stocks , which tumbled before some clawed back their losses. Germany’s Deutsche Bank, France’s BNP Paribas and Italy’s UniCredit ended higher, while London-based Barclays sank 2.3%.

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after a central bank plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) last week failed to reassure investors and customers.

Many of Credit Suisse’s problems were unique and unlike the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S., including high interest rates. Those U.S. failures have raised questions about other potentially weak global financial institutions, sweeping up the already beleaguered Swiss bank.

Credit Suisse has faced an array of troubles in recent years, including bad bets on hedge funds , repeated shakeups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

Analysts and financial leaders say safeguards are stronger since the 2008 global financial crisis and that banks worldwide have plenty of available cash and support from central banks. But concerns about risks to the deal, losses for some investors and Credit Suisse’s falling market value could renew fears about the health of banks .

ADVERTISEMENT

Tobias Straumann, an economic history professor at University of Zurich, said the merger was the right move because the U.S. bank collapses and the danger to Credit Suisse was “an international banking crisis in the making.”

“Markets are very nervous, and I think an additional accident in Switzerland would have fueled a lot of problems,” he said.

Credit Suisse is among 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities were worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

UBS is bigger but Credit Suisse wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. It has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich through its wealth management business, and is a major mergers and acquisitions adviser. However, Credit Suisse weathered the 2008 financial crisis without assistance, unlike UBS.

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in higher-risk Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out, leaving investors with hefty losses. Lawyers were already circling, eyeing possible legal action to get compensation for bondholders amid concern about the market for those bonds and other banks that hold them.

The combination of the two Swiss banks, each with histories dating to the mid-19th century, strikes at the country’s reputation as a global financial center — putting it on the cusp of having a single big national bank that would be too big to fail.

Some customers were caught off guard by the turmoil, at odds with Switzerland’s reputation as as stable banking haven.

Sahil Dua, an Indian software engineer living in Zurich, holds a UBS account but opened one at Credit Suisse last Tuesday, the same day the lender flagged “material weaknesses” in internal financial controls that ultimately helped spark its downward spiral.

“My impression as a customer,” Dua said, is “that at least these two banks were going to be fine, whatever happens.”

Dua said he wanted the credit card that came with the Credit Suisse account and that he considered switching over his primary bank account and bringing his savings from UBS. Not anymore.

ADVERTISEMENT

He has a Credit Suisse account “with a balance of zero, and I’m glad that it’s still zero because I didn’t add any money yet to it.” In the future, he plans to spread out his money in more than one bank.

“I will look into diversification more seriously now,” Dua said.

As the market tries to figure out what comes next after the merger, Straumann, the professor, said he wouldn’t be surprised to see problems for regional banks in Europe after further interest rate increases , much like what happened with midsized banks in U.S.

“The banking system of Europe has not fully recovered from the crisis” in 2008, he said. “It’s better, of course, than it used to be, but it’s vulnerable.”

The very next day, his own boss, pressured into the 3-billion-franc (about $3.25 billion) takeover by regulators around the world, reached for the phone. On the other end was Switzerland’s best known banker, Sergio Ermotti, to whom UBS chairman Colm Kelleher offered Hamer’s job on a platter.

In the midst of a crisis that toppled Credit Suisse after nearly 167 years of history, no one else but Ermotti—an avowed believer in transformational deals—was better suited to steer the new behemoth towards safer waters and limit damage to the country’s reputation as an elite banking center.

The Lugano native couldn’t say no. “I felt a sense of call to duty,” recalled the incoming UBS boss on Wednesday, hours after the bank announced the shock sacking of Hamers.

Ermotti returns to his old post on April 5 with a massive task on his plate: Integrate not just one global systemically important financial institute (G-SIFI) into another, but two archrivals at that, all the while minimizing risks to the Swiss taxpayer.

Speaking to reporters, Kelleher did not mince words when describing the enormous scale of the problem facing Ermotti, who will take over a wealth and asset manager eventually overseeing some $5 trillion in combined client funds.

“We’ve got two storied franchises coming together, a lot of pride, a lot of people who are worried; we have to tread delicately, we have to pick the right people and it will take us time,” he told a hastily arranged news conference. “One of the reasons we appointed Sergio, we’re going to be very sensitive to all these constituencies, he’s well known to both banks and he’s well-known globally.”

The 62-year-old Ermotti has worked in the finance industry his whole life. After starting out as a lowly bank apprentice in Lugano, he joined Citibank and later rose the ranks at Merrill Lynch and UniCredit, mainly in their investment banking arms. Most recently he joined reinsurance group Swiss Re, serving as chairman of the board since April 2021.

Most importantly, however, Ermotti is a known commodity at UBS. He spent nine years as its CEO, inheriting in September 2011 a bank rocked by the scandal around rogue London trader Kweku Adoboli.

Experience in shrinking risky investment banking operations

Ermotti’s track record of shrinking the investment banking operations responsible for the crisis and focusing UBS on the safer, fee-driven advisory business of wealth management put the bank on course to grow its balance sheet to twice the size of Credit Suisse—all while purging it of an unhealthy appetite for risk.

In fact Ermottti’s only regret when he handed over his job at UBS in October 2020—ironically to Hamers, a Dutch national—was never getting the chance to oversee a major deal that dramatically bulk up the venerable Swiss bank.

“It would be a little bit of contradiction not to accept the job to basically execute on what I believe was the right next move for UBS,” explained Ermotti. “I always say for me the debate is not too big to fail, but rather too small to survive—and we want to be a winner,” he told reporters.

It was his transformation of UBS into a highly profitable yet risk-averse superbank, rather than his Swiss passport, that won him the right to return triumphantly to finish what he once started. And unlike other returning CEOs like Bob Iger, he has no intention of relinquishing the reins as long as his presence in Zurich is still wanted.

From the sound of things, that will likely be a while, as the board is cognizant of how highly complex and sensitive the deal is. Nearly 50,500 Credit Suisse employees are set to be added to the existing 74,000 at UBS.

“This is the single biggest financial transaction since 2008,” Kelleher said, adding that it’s also the first time two global systemically important banks have merged. “On that basis we felt that Sergio was better suited to navigating these things, mainly because he has already downsized an investment bank of scale.”

Kelleher wants to shrink the combined investment banking operations to represent only around a quarter of the new entity’s risk-weighted assets.

And while there are some bankers from Credit Suisse who could be attractive to UBS, Kelleher said they would be filtered through a screen to ensure no bad apples infect his organization’s risk-averse culture.

“Our shareholders by and large see significant upside in this transaction,” the bank’s chairman said. “But they are very concerned about execution risk and we have a lot of execution risk here, so this is not in any way an easy deal to do.”

Beat Wittmann, partner at Porta Advisors, told CNBC that the decision to put a Swiss native nevertheless helps restore trust domestically ahead of federal elections in October. “This decision to put Sergio Ermotti—proven and trustworthy in the view of the public at large and also the industry—in place here as the CEO is certainly going to calm discussions, and that is certainly one of the motivations.”",['Christiaan Hetzner'],2023-03-29 00:00:00

Bruce Springsteen played the new Long Island venue UBS Arena for the first time last night. The latest stop of Springsteen and the E Street Band’s 2023 International Tour saw The Boss dust off “Mary’s Place” for its tour debut, likely in response to a sign held by an audience member near the stage.

Located in Elmont, New York, UBS Arena opened in October of 2021 and is the home to the National Hockey League team the New York Islanders. Springsteen and the E Street Band made their debut at UBS Arena on Sunday and return for a second engagement at the venue on Tuesday before concluding the first leg of the massive excursion in Newark, New Jersey this Friday, April 14.

“Mary’s Place” was originally released by The Boss on his exceptional 2002 album The Rising and was played by Springsteen nearly 200 times through February 21, 2017. The song made its triumphant return in the 10-slot last night, a space usually reserved for tour debuts.

Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band treated fans to a spot-on rendition of The Rising standout at UBS Arena. The Boss was in fine form urging the audience to singalong, while the band nailed the breakdowns and modulation.

See the first “Mary’s Place” in over six years via fan-shot video below:

The Boss and his band delivered a 27-song concert last night at UBS Arena. Sunday’s setlist was typical for the tour with the exceptions of the “Mary’s Place” bust out, the third “Bobby Jean” of the five-week old excursion and fifth rendition of “Pay Me My Money Down.” The Boss led his band on four songs from 2020’s Letter To You and filled the evening’s encore with plenty of classics.

Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band are back at UBS Arena tomorrow. View the full itinerary for the group’s 2023 International Tour below.

The latest data from the Federal Reserve shows that borrowing from the central bank decreased slightly last week, suggesting that the liquidity issues caused by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank may be easing. UBS analyst Erika Najarian said in a note to clients that the next step could be a rebound for bank stocks. ""In any bad accident, there tend to be a lot of rubber neckers, and we sense that the market participation (long and short) in banks is broader than usual. While we believe regularly involved hedge fund investors have understood that contagion risk seems limited, we continue to field questions on more extreme scenarios on liquidity and deposit flight. Thus, we see the stage setting for a rally into earnings,"" Najarian said. With many of these stocks still down sharply since the collapse, the upcoming earnings season could be a ""clearing event"" for shares of regional banks, Najarian said. Two of the stocks that UBS highlighted were Comerica and Western Alliance , which are down about 38% and 52%, respectively, in March. WAL 1M mountain Western Alliance is one of many regional bank stocks that has struggled in March. Banks that are based on the west coast, including Western Alliance , First Republic and PacWest, have been hit particularly hard during the sell-off due to fears that they are more exposed to risky customers like SVB had. Comerica is set to report its latest earnings on April 20, and Western Alliance will likely release its results around the same time. To be sure, Najarian did caution that the rebounds could find a ceiling as the regional banking crisis this month has raised questions about the future profitability of the sector. ""Lack of confidence in consensus estimates is especially acute for regional banks, and we expect P/E multiples for banks between $100-700bn in assets to be capped by concerns over net interest income revisions near-term (as many assume that the mega caps enjoyed the lion's share of the benefit in deposit reallocation) and tighter regulation longer-term,"" Najarian said. The potential for more regulation has led many analysts to say that the the biggest banks will be the long-term winners from this crisis. Najarian pointed to Bank of America as one stock that could rally even past earnings, due to its relative valuation to rival JPMorgan Chase . — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.","['Jesse Pound', 'In Jesse-Pound']",2023-03-31 00:00:00

With the impeccable timing of one of the country's famed watches, Swiss officials brokered a last-minute emergency takeover of the troubled bank Credit Suisse by fellow banking giant UBS.

In a press conference on Sunday, Swiss president Alain Berset said the recent banking industry turmoil had destabilized Credit Suisse and that this deal was vital to stabilizing the bank and the global banking sector.

Under the deal, UBS Group AG will buy Credit Suisse for more than $3 billion in an all stock deal. UBS will also get an extra $100 billion from the Swiss central bank as part of the deal.

Swiss Assist

The marriage between UBS and struggling rival Credit Suisse marks the latest eruption in the ongoing banking troubles sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

Panicked investors and jittery depositors pulled billions out of the long-troubled Credit Suisse in recent days, leading to worries the bank could become insolvent if emergency measures were not taken. The Swiss central bank threw a $54 billion life to Credit Suisse, but it wasn't enough to stabilize the institution.

It's yet another stunning event in more than a week of turmoil and alarm in the banking sector, especially worrisome because Credit Suisse is what's known as a ""global systemically important bank."" That essentially means if Credit Suisse fails, it could have ripple effects throughout the global economy.

A History of Trouble

The Credit Suisse crisis boiled over last week, when the bank announced ""material weaknesses"" in its financial reporting.

But the bank's troubles started long before that, with a series of financial and political scandals that hit the bank's reputation and bottom line. In the last two years alone, the bank's stock has fallen by more than 80%.

Credit Suisse was created 166 years ago to help finance Switzerland's rail network. It became an international name in the banking sector and one of the most significant banks in the world

But the bank's reputation has taken several huge hits in recent years, including being linked to a money laundering operation involving a cocaine trafficking ring in Bulgaria, and hiring detectives to spy on an executive who left to work at a rival bank.",['Stacey Vanek Smith'],2023-03-19 00:00:00

For the January to March 2023 quarter, banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) segment accounted for about 31.4 percent of TCS revenue. Of the total order book value of $10 billion, the segment had a total contract value (TCV) of $3 billion in Q4.

“Our approach is to stay agile,” TCS management told CNBC-TV18 in an exclusive interaction and added that uncertainty is still lingering and likely to be there for some time. Customers are prioritising some spends over others.

Speaking of specifics, they said manufacturing and auto sectors have seen discretionary projects being put on hold. BFSI is also seeing caution where clients want to spend wisely, outgoing CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said.

""We are not seeing any deal cancellations. Budgets are largely intact and clients want to spend wisely and be cautious for a few weeks,” he added.

K Krithivasan, who takes over as CEO on June 1, said that some discretionary work may be deferred or cancelled by Credit Suisse as merger with UBS progresses.

“Customers are likely to prioritise certain kinds of projects over others – defer and not cancel. Our thesis is technology spend is quite resilient and customers need that to remain competitive in the marketplace. So, they cannot say that I will not do these kinds of projects; they have to do those projects, they may defer.”

He explained that projects with long return on assets (ROA) timelines are the ones that typically get held. ""Would you call cloud a discretionary project or a non-discretionary? We keep signing cloud deals and cloud deals keep going on. So, each bank and each institution’s situation vary. It depends on where they think there is an immediate opportunity,” he said.

TCS management's remarks come a day after India's largest IT services exporter reported a five percent sequential increase in March quarter net profit to Rs 11,392 crore while the firm flagged worries from its key market of North America.

Events like the fall of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and fears of a contagion have impacted client sentiments in North America and the banking, financial services and insurance sector in particular, leading to clients deferring spends, the Tata Group company said.

The company reported revenue growth of 0.6 percent in constant currency terms, which was the slowest since the April-June period of financial year 2021, which is the quarter in which the pandemic hit. Gopinathan conceded that the growth in the topline over the December quarter has been ""weaker than anticipated"" because of the setbacks in North America.

He said the ""negative"" sentiment has led to a situation where discretionary spends are being put on hold by clients, and added that it is ""wait and watch"" in the immediate near-term for them. There have been no project cancellations and the structural story of Indian IT is intact, he added.

Brokerage firm JPMorgan cited the earnings miss to unexpected weakness in the US, particularly in BFSI, and continued challenges in Europe. The firm also opined that client caution driving cuts to discretionary spends and project deferrals will impact near-term growth outlook.",[],2023-04-13 09:34:09+05:30

https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/credit-suisse-execs-address-ubs-takeover,Credit Suisse execs address UBS takeover,"Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann and CEO Ulrich Korner on Tuesday addressed the Switzerland-based bank’s near-collapse and UBS’s planned takeover of it.

In a speech published on the bank’s investor website, Lehmann said it ""pains"" him that the bank’s leaders ""didn’t have the time"" to get the beleaguered bank ""back on track"" and that their plans ""were disrupted"" in March. He said he was sorry they ""were no longer able to stem the loss of trust that had accumulated over the years, and for disappointing you.""

Lehmann’s speech was delivered at the bank’s annual general meeting roughly two weeks after UBS and Credit Suisse agreed to an $3.2 billion deal involving a takeover by the former. It was arranged by Swiss officials.

UBS REACHES AGREEMENT TO BUY CREDIT SUISSE AFTER UPPING OFFER

Lehmann said he ""believed in a successful turnaround"" of Credit Suisse ""until the beginning of the fateful week."" He pointed to sentiment, which he said had been impacted by factors like interest rates and inflation, and contagion fears, which were related to a couple banks collapsing in the U.S.

Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank were taken over by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in March, with another bank, Silvergate, having folded not long prior to that. Those collapses were followed by turbulence in the market, particularly among some banking stocks.

Credit Suisse, Lehmann noted, also faced a ""major setback"" in October with ""massive"" outflows. It ""could not be saved"" despite efforts to do so, he said.

Lehmann told shareholders the UBS merger ""had to go through,"" arguing a restructuring would have ""led to the worst scenario."" He called the board approving the transaction ""one of the most difficult moments"" for him.

Korner, who also spoke at the meeting, offered a sentiment similar to Lehmann’s about the company running out of time for the revamping that had been planned for it, saying it ""fills me with sorrow,"" according to prepared remarks.

""What has happened over the past few weeks will continue to affect me personally and many others for a long time to come,"" the CEO said.

""The collapse of Credit Suisse would have been catastrophic not just for Switzerland but for the global economy,"" Korner said. ""Together with the Swiss Federal Council, the Swiss National Bank and FINMA, we worked hard to find possible solutions within a limited timeframe. In the end, the merger with UBS was the only feasible option.""

The deal came about without shareholder approval. It was slammed by many shareholders who attended the meeting, according to Reuters.

LONDON, March 23 (Reuters) - The Swiss authorities and UBS Group AG are racing to close the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG within as little as a month, according to two sources with knowledge of the plans, to try to retain the lender's clients and employees.

But combining Credit Suisse into UBS could take much longer, potentially months, because the deal needs approval from regulators in tens of countries, the people said, seeking anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter.

Spokespeople for UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment.

""UBS has made a full commitment to the takeover of Credit Suisse... Now it is extremely important that both parties do everything possible that the takeover will be successful,"" Thomas Jordan, Swiss National Bank Chairman said on Thursday, adding the next two weeks would be crucial.

""This is absolutely necessary and we got all the commitments from both parties that they will do everything for this takeover to be successful.""

Asked for more precise details on when the deal could close at the same media conference, the vice chairman declined to comment.

""We are waiting for final regulatory approvals across the globe so we will complete this deal as quickly as we can,"" UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said on Sunday. ""It will be weeks, short months to get this deal effectively closed.""

The longer the deal takes to close, the harder it will be for Credit Suisse to hold on to its business as the uncertainty erodes confidence in the lender.

Bank of America's electronic stocks desk had halted trading with a desk at Credit Suisse that uses computer-led strategies, an email seen by Reuters on Monday said.

Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that Wall Street banks and European firms are lifting hiring freezes to lure staff from Credit Suisse.

A wave of defaults doesn’t mean a tsunami, it says","In a matter of nine days, bank runs and global financial distress saw regional U.S. banks like Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank go under, while European regulators helped to broker a deal for UBS to buy rival giant Credit Suisse, which had just collapsed.

While central bankers and policymakers alike try to assess what type of economic fallout could come from the March bank runs, the commercial real estate industry is already bracing for pain. Even before these bank failures, commercial office space defaults were rising as owners got squeezed by high vacancy rates, falling property values, and higher interest rates. That’ll only intensify if these bank woes see lenders further tighten lending standards for commercial real estate (CRE) loans.

Earlier this week, analysts at Morgan Stanley took a bearish tone, writing their forecast of “a peak-to-trough CRE price decline of as much as 40%” would be worse than the dip seen during the Great Financial Crisis. However, a report published on Thursday by analysts at UBS, a Zurich-based multinational investment bank, struck a less pessimistic tone, writing that commercial real estate “headlines are worse than reality,” and troubles aren’t likely to create a “repeat of the 2008 liquidity crisis.”

“Rising interest rates, a slowing economy, and increasing vacancy rates in office buildings have weighed on the sector in the last couple of years. Now, an expected credit crunch on the back of rising cost of funding for banks may further compound its troubles. However, in our view, while the risks in CRE have certainly increased, it does not pose a wider systemic risk,” wrote UBS Americas chief investment officer Solita Marcelli and UBS equity strategist Jonathan Woloshin.

Here’s how Marcelli and Woloshin see the CRE landscape.

Commercial real estate defaults are coming

In 2023 and 2024, approximately $1.2 trillion of the outstanding $5.4 trillion in commercial real estate debt (excluding multifamily) will “mature” and need to be refinanced at, presumably, higher interest rates. Those elevated debt payments, wrote Marcelli and Woloshin, will “only add to existing challenges around servicing debt—especially in areas like office and certain segments of retail where cash flows have become challenged due to post-pandemic behavior.”

Simply put: Owners of commercial office space are seeing a hit to their property values and revenues (i.e., rising vacancy rates as remote work proves sticky) just as their debt payments rise (i.e., maturing loans). The recent bank failures will only make this messier.

“A growing share of CRE loans from banks have become serviced by regional and local banks in recent years—with around 70% now coming from this population. Given the recent collapses of both SVB and SBNY—both of which happened to have a large share of CRE as a percentage of their total loan book—the market has grown concerned that regulations around these banks will tighten and lending will become increasingly restrictive, thus reducing lending access,” wrote Marcelli and Woloshin at UBS.

The result? The UBS analysts say CRE “default rates will likely” continue to rise.

‘A liquidity crisis similar to 2008 remains unlikely’

But an uptick in CRE defaults doesn’t mean doomsday for banks, write the UBS analysts.

For starters, the UBS team points out that the most troubled sector of commercial real estate (i.e., office space) only accounts for 15% of the total value of U.S. commercial real estate.

“About $1.3 billion of office mortgage loans are currently slated to mature over the next three years. It’s possible that some of these loans will need to be restructured, but the scope of the issue pales in comparison to the more than $2 trillion of bank equity capital. Office exposure for banks represents less than 5% of total loans and just 1.9% on average for large banks,” wrote Marcelli and Woloshin. The “stress” that does come “could take several years to unfold as leases come due over an extended period of time.”

Unlike, say, ground retail leases, office space leases are often in terms that extend near or beyond 10 years. Those long leases are why office space owners didn‘t buckle as occupancy rates plummeted during the pandemic. That long time horizon is another reason why UBS doesn’t foresee CRE spurring a 2008-style banking crash.

“We don’t believe a repeat of the 2008 liquidity crisis is likely,” wrote Marcelli and Woloshin. “In our view, the health of the overall banking system and market liquidity conditions are substantially better than they were during the GFC.”

If a recession hits, things could get murkier

As the Federal Reserve nears the end of its rate hiking cycle, employment and economic activity at large haven’t been significantly impacted. While most economists are weary of uttering the words “soft landing,” there’s also no consensus on whether the much talked about recession will actually happen.

But if a sharp recession does come, commercial real estate in the United States and Europe would be in for even more trouble.

“A more severe economic downturn (hard landing) over 2023–24 could pull forward [commercial real estate] credit issues that would have otherwise been avoided or stretched over a longer period thereby pressuring banks’ earnings growth and profitability…While we view potential losses as manageable, we would expect a meaningful deterioration in CRE to pressure banks’ shares due to both earnings/profitability risk,” wrote Marcelli and Woloshin.",['Lance Lambert'],2023-04-07 00:00:00

https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/24/investing/european-bank-stocks-ubs-deutsche/index.html,"Deutsche Bank, UBS stocks sink as fear of European banking crisis returns","London CNN —

Europe’s banking stocks tumbled Friday as investors acted on their lingering worries that the recent crises at some banks could spill over into the wider sector.

Europe’s Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index, which tracks 42 big EU and UK banks, closed 3.8% lower. The index is down 18% from its high in late February. London’s bank-heavy FTSE 100 index closed down 1.3%.

Shares in Germany’s biggest bank, Deutsche Bank (DB), plunged as much as 14.5% before paring its losses to close 8.5% lower. Shares in UBS (UBS) and Credit Suisse (CS) were 3.6% and 5.2% down respectively.

The cost of insuring against a possible default by Deutsche Bank on its debt has soared in recent days. Deutsche’s five-year credit default swaps (CDS) skyrocketed to 203 basis points Thursday, according to data from S&P Market Intelligence. That’s their highest level since early 2019.

The swaps rose again Friday to trade at 208 basis points at midday ET.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Friday that there was “no reason to be concerned” about Deutsche Bank.

“It’s a very profitable bank,” he told reporters in Brussels, where EU leaders issued a joint statement describing the European banking system as “resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions.”

Deutsche Bank declined to comment.

“The rising price of insuring CDS senior debt is weighing on Deutsche Bank, as well as other European banks, on concerns over the impact of rising rates on the wider economy and banks’ balance sheets,” Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, told CNN.

Last week, the European Central Bank stuck with its plan to hike interest rates by half a percentage point, judging that inflation posed a bigger threat to the economy than recent turmoil in the banking sector.

Then, on Thursday, the Bank of England raised its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point after data showed a surprise spike in inflation last month.

But Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at investing platform Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNN that market nerves were out of step with reality.

“Worries about contagion are again rearing up even though more deposits appear to have been flowing into the German lender since the banking scare erupted, and it is thought to have capital reserves well in excess of regulatory requirements,” she said.

Some analysts said investors had been rattled by Deutsche Bank’s announcement Friday that it would pay back one of its bonds five years before its maturity date. Investors would usually interpret such a move as a sign that a company is in good financial health and able to pay back its creditors early.

But — after two bank collapses in the United States and an emergency takeover of Credit Suisse this month — some investors may have interpreted the announcement as a sign that Deutsche Bank is nervous about the state of the banking sector and trying to overcompensate, Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics, told CNN.

Goltermann said the bank’s decision “seems to have backfired.”

Deutsche Bank’s decision to pay back the bond ahead of schedule was pre-planned and not a reaction to recent market developments, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The bond would have gradually lost its eligibility as a form of regulatory capital according to rules brought in after the 2008 financial crisis, the source said.

The bank replaced the bond by issuing another bond of the same type in February, they added.

Shares of Germany’s Commerzbank (CRZBF) and France’s Société Générale also suffered heavy losses, closing 5.5% and 5.9% lower respectively.

Swiss banks still rattled

Last week, Switzerland’s biggest bank UBS bought its embattled Swiss rival for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion) in an emergency takeover brokered by the Swiss government.

That helped restore some calm to markets rattled by the failure earlier this month of two US regional banks. But investors were on edge again Friday.

The falls in UBS and Credit Suisse come after Bloomberg reported Thursday that the US Department of Justice was investigating whether their staff had helped Russian oligarchs evade Western sanctions.

The DOJ had sent subpoenas to those employees before UBS took over Credit Suisse, according to the report.

Employees at some major US banks are also part of the probe, Bloomberg said.

Hewson at CMC Markets said “the DOJ probe into UBS is certainly playing a part in the share price weakness” in European banks.

The Swiss authorities mediated the agreement, which will allow UBS to integrate its US operations and activities with Credit Suisse's US companies. UBS requested approval on 22 March and as part of the agreement, it will furnish the Fed with an implementation plan for the merger within three months of the transaction's completion.

The Fed has ordered UBS to submit a plan that includes liquidity standards as well as compliance with more stringent “enhanced prudential standards.” Because of the increased scale of the institution, the UBS-Credit Suisse investment banking merger has tightened measures.

According to US bank merger legislation, the Federal Reserve must consider bank mergers when a bank with more than USD 250 billion in total assets buys any voting shares in a corporation with USD 10 billion or more in assets. Although Swiss regulators are largely involved in the merging of Europe's banking titans, the US central bank has to weigh in because each company has American operations. The Fed's decision cleared the path for UBS to acquire all of Credit Suisse's US operations.

Last month, the stunning collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the United States shook investor confidence in Switzerland's largest bank, Credit Suisse. To prevent further banking turmoil, Swiss authorities announced that Credit Suisse would be bought out by UBS, which had also nearly failed.

UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs (USD 3.3 billion), a considerable discount from its prior market value. According to the takeover deal, shareholders would receive USD 3.23 billion, while holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will receive no compensation despite normally ranking lower in the payment hierarchy than shareholders.

UBS received interim approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month, but the bank still needs to secure clearance under EU merger standards. Meanwhile, the Bank of England has apparently approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, according to Reuters. UBS expects the acquisition to result in a company with more than USD 5 trillion in total invested assets.

The acquisition, according to UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher, is a big milestone for Switzerland and the global financial system, but it entails a “huge amount of risk.” The acquisition will take at least three to four years, excluding Credit Suisse's non-core investment bank portfolio, which will total more than USD 5 trillion in invested assets.",['Bw Online Bureau'],2023-04-15 14:36:00

Swiss prosecutors have opened an investigation into possible illegal activity in connection with government support for UBS’ rushed takeover of Credit Suisse.

The two banks agreed to merge in March as part of an emergency deal targeted at avoiding a national financial crisis that could have had a knock-on effect globally.

“The Federal Prosecutor’s office wants to proactively fulfill its mission and responsibility to contribute to a clean Swiss financial center and has set up monitoring in order to take immediate action in any situation that falls within its field of activity,” the authority said in a statement.

Last month, Zurich-based UBS was forced by Swiss authorities to take over its longtime domestic rival Credit Suisse in a deal that creates a new bank.

The prosecutor's statement said that the intention of the probe was to “analyze and identify any criminal offenses” associated with the deal, adding that various bodies had been contacted to provide clarifications and information.

The deal has been unpopular locally and on Sunday, Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger reported that the new entity could slash jobs by up to 30 percent.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) shares are roughly 2% in pre-market Tuesday after UBS analyst Karl Keirstead issued a warning that Street expectations for cloud growth remain too high for the first quarter.

Amazon, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are expected to report on their Q1 performance later this month.

“Our checks down-ticked relative to our last round 3 months ago and in our view, Street growth estimates for 2023 are still too high,” Keirstead said in a client note.

For Amazon particularly, the Street estimates remain way too high. The Street expects AWS growth of 15% in Q1, down from the 20% reported for the fourth quarter. Keirstead projects that AWS likely grew 13% in Q1.

“This implies the growth rate of industry leader AWS will have gone from 40% in 4Q21 to 13% in 1Q23 in just 5 quarters. We find this a surprising turn of events that far exceeds the pressure we’re witnessing across most other technology sub-sectors. In our view, this is clear evidence of a significant pandemic-fueled cloud demand boost and resulting wasteful spend that is now being eliminated by enterprises and their consulting partners.”

Moreover, the analyst warns that “most investors believe that these estimates are too high and that AWS revs growth could hit 8-10% in 2Q23.” For Q2, UBS sees AWS growing at 10%.

“The current sell-side analyst consensus estimate is for AWS revenue growth to level out at ~14% in 4Q23 from 15% in 1Q23, presumably on the basis of easier comparisons and/or a 2H23 demand improvement. In our view, most (at least tech/software) investors have little/no confidence in these estimates and are modeling AWS revs growth to dip to 8-10% in 2Q23 and to be ~10% in 4Q23,” the analyst added.

Overall, the analyst concludes by saying that the cloud growth is “much worse” than expected and “is unchartered territory for most investors.”

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-suisse-pays-back-emergency-101613470.html,"Credit Suisse pays back some emergency liquidity, central bank data suggests","ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse has already paid back some of the emergency liquidity offered by the Swiss National Bank (SNB), data suggested on Tuesday, signaling an ebbing of the liquidity crisis which triggered the lender's fall.

Sight deposits - cash held by commercial banks overnight with the SNB - fell by 31 billion Swiss francs ($34.3 billion)last week, data published by the central bank showed.

The drop was the second-biggest weekly decline on record, second only to when the SNB started mopping up market liquidity after it quit negative interest rates last September.

In recent weeks sight deposits have soared as Credit Suisse received emergency liquidity infusions to head off a bank run as nervous customers pulled out their cash.

The lender last month said it intended to borrow up to 50 billion francs from the SNB in a last-ditch attempt to save itself after confidence evaporated following a string of blunders.

Following a state-sponsored takeover by rival UBS, another 200 billion francs in liquidity was also made available by the SNB.

As a result sight deposits rose from 515 billion in mid March to peak at 567 billion francs as the SNB deposited the cash with Credit Suisse, an upward trend which reversed last week as sight deposits fell to 532 billion francs.

Credit Suisse, the SNB and UBS declined to comment on the development.

Karsten Junius, an economist at J.Safra Sarasin, said the decline could be attributed to Credit Suisse paying back some of the emergency liquidity it took and no longer needing to draw on the central bank support.

""Confidence in the bank has been restored by the UBS merger, and from this data it would appear customer outflows have stopped,"" Junius said.

""A bank run has been stopped by the SNB coming in and offering massive liquidity and customers are reassured by UBS being there too. Credit lines from other banks would also appear to have been re-established.""

The SNB may also have been active in forex markets, selling some of its foreign currencies to prop up the franc, an activity which would have seen sight deposits decline as the SNB received francs from commercial banks in return.

Story continues

But this was likely to be minor, Junius said, saying the SNB only sold foreign currencies worth 27 billion in the last three months of 2022.

""It's extremely unlikely the SNB sold more than 30 billion of forex just last week,"" Junius said. ""Confidence has been restored – the rescue seems to have done the trick. It seems to have been a successful operation.""

Swiss prosecutors have launched a probe into the takeover of Credit Suisse by its arch rival UBS as scrutiny of the highly controversial acquisition intensified, according to a report.

Switzerland's Federal Prosecutor told the Financial Times it was looking into potential breaches of Swiss criminal law by government officials, regulators and executives at the banks.

UBS bought Credit Suisse for $3.25 billion last month in an emergency rescue deal brokered by regulators following a loss of confidence in the lender that began when its biggest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn't put more funds in.

""The Federal Prosecutor's office wants to proactively fulfil its mission and responsibility to contribute to a clean Swiss financial centre and has set up monitoring in order to take immediate action in any situation that falls within its field of activity,"" the authority told the FT.

The group said there were ""numerous aspects of events around Credit Suisse"" that required investigation to ""identify any crimes.""

UBS did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider.

Combining the two banks has created a huge institution with a balance sheet of $5.5 trillion, or about twice the entire Swiss economy.

That has caused political unrest in Switzerland, which is now heavily exposed to a financial institution that hasn't yet convinced markets that its Credit Suisse arm is now secure.

More than half of Swiss voters oppose the takeover, according to a GFS poll reported by Bloomberg. More were in favor of a temporary takeover of the troubled Credit Suisse, while a majority now prefer the bank to be broken up, per the FT.

The Swiss parliament released a statement last week announcing special joint sessions to investigate the takeover.

""The main question is whether the actions of the federal authorities were lawful, appropriate and effective,"" the group said.

The bank is reportedly planning to lay off up to 30% of its workforce following its takeover of Credit Suisse that would equal tens of thousands of job losses, SonntagsZeitung first reported.

The Board wishes to express its deep gratitude to Ralph Hamers for his outstanding leadership, steering UBS to record results in two successive years, and for his instrumental role in bringing about the Credit Suisse acquisition

ZURICH & BASEL, Switzerland, March 29, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:

Ad hoc announcement pursuant to Article 53 of the SIX Exchange Regulation Listing Rules

Further to the announcement of 19 March 2023 regarding UBS’s (NYSE:UBS) (SWX:UBSN) acquisition of Credit Suisse, the Board of Directors of UBS have appointed Sergio P. Ermotti as Group Chief Executive Officer and President of the Group Executive Board, effective on 5 April 2023, after the Annual General Meeting. He will succeed Ralph Hamers, who has agreed to step down to serve the interests of the new combination, the Swiss financial sector and the country. Ralph Hamers will remain at UBS and work alongside Sergio P. Ermotti as an advisor during a transition period to ensure a successful closure of the transaction and a smooth hand-over.

The Board took the decision in light of the new challenges and priorities facing UBS after the announcement of the acquisition.

Sergio P. Ermotti was the Group Chief Executive Officer of UBS for 9 years and successfully repositioned UBS following the severe challenges arising from the Global Financial Crisis. In particular, he built financial strength and improved resilience by putting the firm’s leading global wealth and asset management business, and Swiss universal bank, at its core. He swiftly transformed the investment bank by cutting its footprint and achieved a profound culture change within the bank which allowed it to regain the trust of clients and other stakeholders, while restoring people’s pride in working for UBS. This unique experience, together with his deep understanding of the financial services industry in Switzerland and globally, make Sergio P. Ermotti ideally placed to pursue the integration of Credit Suisse. Sergio P. Ermotti is currently Chairman of Swiss Re. To facilitate an orderly transition at Swiss Re, Sergio P. Ermotti will stand for re-election at its AGM on 12 April 2023 and intends to step down after the AGM, following a short hand-over period.

Story continues

Since assuming the role on 1 November 2020, Ralph Hamers, together with the Group Executive Board, has successfully managed UBS through a challenging market environment and has delivered record results in two successive years. He has encouraged a strong focus on clients and on shaping and executing our strategy, while ensuring tight cost management and strong risk discipline. He has driven the digital and sustainability agenda across the firm to make them important differentiators for our clients. The financial performance and capital strengths of the group have allowed him to achieve record returns for shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which has benefited the share price. Finally, Ralph was instrumental in delivering the acquisition of Credit Suisse under extreme circumstances, to the benefit of both banks and the stability of the Swiss financial system.

UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said: ""Ralph has been an outstanding CEO of UBS, driving the group to unprecedented success despite a challenging environment. Under his leadership UBS built the strengths that have put us in a position to stabilize Credit Suisse and ensure a successful integration. On behalf of the whole Board, I would like to express my deep respect and gratitude for all that Ralph has achieved over the last two-and-a-half years and for his instrumental role in delivering the Credit Suisse deal, as well as his understanding of the current situation and willingness to step down. While the acquisition will support UBS’s existing strategy, it imposes new priorities on us. With his unique experience, I am very confident that Sergio will deliver the successful integration that is so essential for both banks’ clients, employees and investors, and for Switzerland. I know Sergio will hit the ground running.""

Ralph Hamers said: ""Integrating Credit Suisse is UBS’s single most important task and I am confident that Sergio will successfully guide the bank through this next phase. I am of course sorry to leave UBS, but circumstances have changed in ways that none of us expected. I am stepping aside in the interests of the new combined entity and its stakeholders, including Switzerland and its financial sector – it has been a pleasure and privilege to lead this great bank to where it is today. I would like to thank Colm and the Board for their support and guidance, and I wish Sergio every success.

Separately, new orders for US-manufactured goods fell for a second straight month in February, with business spending on equipment staying weak.

While the US labor market remains tight, and the figures can be volatile on a monthly basis, the JOLTS report nonetheless showed signs of cooling. The yield on two-year US Treasuries dropped by more than 14 basis points following the data release, and the dollar index fell 0.5%.

As the slowdown of the US economy becomes more apparent, we think investors should prepare for a peak in interest rates by considering opportunities in bonds in the current environment.

Recession risks have increased. In addition to the declining factory orders, the ISM manufacturing PMI in March (46.3), released earlier this week, was the lowest reading since May 2020. It also marked the index’s fifth straight month in contraction territory. The banking sector turmoil last month showed that the Federal Reserve’s aggressive tightening last year is having an impact on the economy, and the likely tighter financial conditions that follow could weigh on economic activity further.

The Fed is nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle. While inflation remains sticky, the Fed is likely nearing the end of its rate-hike campaign as it balances the battle with inflation against risks to growth and financial stability. The latest FOMC statement removed the reference to “ongoing increases” in rates likely being appropriate, instead stating that “some additional policy firming may be appropriate.” The futures market also suggests a peak in the federal funds rate in May, instead of September, prior to the Silicon Valley Bank crisis.

The equity outlook is challenging. We expect global stocks to deliver limited returns and exhibit high volatility over the remainder of the year, and have recently downgraded equities to least preferred in our global strategy. In the US, we estimate earnings to contract by 4.5% this year following negative growth in 4Q22, while valuations remain unattractive: The S&P 500 forward P/E multiple is now over 18.5, which leaves little room for positive surprises, and a lot of scope for disappointment.

So, we remain most preferred on bonds. We see opportunities in high-quality fixed income given decent yields and the scope for capital gains in the event of an economic slowdown. We prefer high grade (government) and investment grade bonds, as well as sustainable issues. We also see value in emerging market bonds amid improving growth prospects and a weaker US dollar.

https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2023/03/credit-suisse-ubs-culture,Morning Coffee: UBS bankers fear “rancid” Credit Suisse bankers will spoil things. Male banker accused of intimidating female colleagues fights back,"If anyone has any doubts about UBS bankers enthusiasm for their fun new Credit Suisse colleagues, an article in yesterday’s Financial Times should help set them right. UBS bankers are not partial to their new adjuncts, and they are not holding back in expressing this.

Credit Suisse is “rancid” place, one senior US banker explains to the FT, deferring to give his name. It’s full of people ‘sharp elbows,’ says another, and they are particularly pointy in the investment bank. At Credit Suisse people have long been in it for themselves and encouraged to take advantage of the bank’s balance sheet in order to maximize their own bonuses, say its UBS decriers. It’s a flashy place, full of people who don’t necessarily like each other.

It's not like this at UBS. There, insiders say it’s “friendly, collegial, team-oriented.” People there have genuine bonds with each other. They keep their heads down.

In an illustration of the outré behaviours at Credit Suisse, the FT says some of Credit Suisse’s bankers were in a corporate box at the John Mayer concert in Madison Square Garden in New York when the news of the UBS rescue broke on Sunday. In a public display of non-penitence, they all began high-fiving each other.

A similar, although less vigorous lack of penitence is in evidence in Tidjane Thiam’s spiel (also in the FT) yesterday. There, the former Credit Suisse CEO often held partly culpable for Credit Suisse’s demise through his blind emphasis on hiring relationship managers in Asia, dumping of senior talent in the prime broking division which subsequently became embroiled in the Archegos scandal, and promotion of Lara Warner, a former equity researcher as chief risk officer, laments Credit Suisse's fate.- And says it was nothing to do with him.

Despite presiding over a decline in Credit Suisse’s share price from around CHF19 to around CHF10, Thiam remains convinced that he did nothing wrong and that he was instead Credit Suisse’s partial redeemer. “When I stepped down as the chief executive of Credit Suisse, it had just posted its highest profits for 10 years after a deep restructuring,” Thiam wrote in the FT yesterday. He then pointed out all the capital he raised, his emphasis on the bank’s risk systems, his focus on behaviour and his addition of many, many compliance staff. Thiam, it seems, did everything right. It was his successors who flatulated upon his legacy.

Thiam's self-absolvement has caused some incredulity among his former colleagues. ""I am speechless,"" wrote former Credit Suisse banks analyst Rhupak Ghose on Twitter. Someone else called Bong Capital credited Thiam, saying ""I have never before seen a CEO take responsibility as he does here."" However, this appears to have been ironic.

Separately, men everywhere who feel maligned by women can get behind Robert Record, a former Barclays wealth manager dismissed in 2020 after 14 years for gross misconduct.

Record's misconduct followed ""disciplinary findings"" accusing him of ""unwelcome physical contact with a female colleague, sexual harassment of another colleague and language and behaviour which reasonably could be taken to be a racial slur."" The accusations ranged from excluding a female colleague from a scavenger hunt, staring at breasts, inappropriate touching, and generally behaving in an ""intimidating way.""

Record says this is all wrong and is suing Barclays for $720k. He says his female colleagues made it all up because they wanted to get rid of him. All will become clear.

https://www.forbes.com/advisor/au/investing/credit-suisse-shares-all-you-need-to-know/,Credit Suisse Stocks And Shares: All You Need To Know,"Swiss regulators have engineered an emergency rescue package for Swiss bank Credit Suisse in the form of a merger with its long-time rival UBS.

Credit Suisse shareholders have suffered a loss of more than 70% this year, as the beleaguered bank has been hit by a series of crises that undermined the confidence of shareholders and customers alike.

And the failure of another major bank after the high-profile collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in the US has rippled through the wider financial sector, with Australian, UK and US banks nursing significant share price falls over the last month.

While the ASX has been rattled by the bank collapses overseas, predictably, the big four banks have fared worse than other ASX200 stocks, losing as much as 15% from previous highs earlier this year. The ASX is down by more than 8% for the comparable period.

Meanwhile, ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott published remarks on the ANZ Blue Notes website today that addressed concerns recent banking shocks could be the precursor to another global financial crisis.

“It’s like that old saying, you know, that history doesn’t repeat, but it rhymes. There are lots of rhymes here that we can see in previous turmoils or crises, including the GFC, but actually, when you really get the microscope out, the causes and what’s going on here are really, really different than the GFC,” Elliott says.

We’re going to take a closer look at what existing and potential investors need to know about Credit Suisse shares after the merger announcement and the potential ramifications for the Australian arm of the company.

https://beststocks.com/ubs-group-downgrades-rating-on-jd-com-stock-causi/,"UBS Group Downgrades Rating on JD.com Stock, Causing Market Stir and Uncertainty for Shareholders","Recently, investment analysts from UBS Group downgraded their rating on JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) stock. The shift came as a surprise to some, and caused a stir in the financial world. This change in recommendation is notable because it could result in significant changes to the market value of the information services provider.

The reasons for this rating reduction are not entirely clear at this time, but there have been shifts in institutional investors’ positions. Gateway Investment Advisers LLC increased its holdings by 3%, purchasing an additional 176 shares during Q4 of 2020. Compagnie Lombard Odier SCmA also boosted its position during this time period by an additional 200 shares. Harbor Investment Advisory LLC experienced a more substantial increase of 43.8% with the purchase of an additional 203 shares.

E Fund Management Co. Ltd., during Q3 of last year, purchased an additional 239 shares which lifted their position by 3.8%. First Manhattan Co., too saw a rise in its overall ownership stake with the addition of another 244 shares – an increase of 32.5%.

This is a significant development that could impact the future prospects of JD.com as it deals with increasing competition and technological advancements in e-commerce space. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how significant this downgrade will prove to be over time and what other effects or events may arise that will further shape investor sentiment toward this particular company.

Institutional investors and hedge funds own nearly one-fifth of JD.com’s stock, indicating that major players closely follow movements at several levels within the company’s hierarchy. Investors who plan on holding onto shares should pay close attention to any updates or reports that might shed light on these developments.

While uncertainty still exists about how long-term investors stand on Jd.com shares, shareholders should brace themselves for more volatility ahead given such unpredictability surrounding institutional investors’ interests.

In summary, all eyes are firmly focused on JD.com shares after the recent downgrade by UBS Group, which is an indicator that there might be troubles brewing for the company. The shifts in institutional investors’ positions only add to this uncertainty, making this a challenging period for long-term shareholders of JD.com. Only time and further events will shed more light on the future trajectory of JD.com’s stock as investors closely monitor updates from inside and outside the company.



JD.com’s Recent Analyst Reports and Market Trends: An Overview

JD.com: A Look at Recent Analyst Reports and Market Trends

In today’s tumultuous market, investors are seeking guidance from those who understand the workings of industry and business. Thus, recent reports on JD.com by Loop Capital, BOCOM International, Susquehanna, Barclays, and Morgan Stanley have given investors some insight into where the e-commerce company currently stands.

Of note is Loop Capital’s downgrade of JD from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating. In addition to this change in their assessment, they also reduced their price target for the stock from $82.00 to $49.00. Similarly, BOCOM International downgraded JD from “buy” to “neutral” while Susquehanna and Barclays both reduced their price targets for the company as well.

Despite these recent changes in ratings and assessments by industry experts, JD still maintains a consensus rating of “Hold”. According to data from Bloomberg, the current consensus price target for JD is $67.42.

It’s important to note that all this comes as JD stock opened at $36.95 on Thursday with a 1-year low of $33.17 and high of $68.29. When it comes to financials, JD has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.11 with a current ratio of 1.32 and quick ratio of 1.02.

JD operates through three primary segments: retail, logistics, and new businesses such as its cloud computing arm JD Cloud or its messaging platform WeChat-like service Jingxi Xiaodian (京喜小店). It offers sales on electronics products such as audio-visual equipment as well as general merchandise which includes books & beauty products among others.

The e-commerce giant has been through challenging times politically ad culturally since last year but with positive annual revenue figures totaling over USD28 billion investors expect growing recovery and stability in coming years.

Undoubtedly, the economy is constantly shifting, and company assessments are not always straightforward.

Summary Companies Buying back at issue price

Issued on March 9

Follows takeover of Credit Suisse















March 22 (Reuters) - UBS Group (UBSG.S) said on Wednesday it would buy back 2.75 billion euros ($2.96 billion) worth of debt it sold just days ago in a bid to boost confidence among bondholders rattled by its $3 billion rescue of rival Credit Suisse.

UBS' takeover saw holders of Credit Suisse's Additional Tier 1 bonds getting written down to zero while shareholders will receive some UBS stock, an unusual move that sees stock owners benefiting from better terms.

UBS is buying back its own bonds at the price at which they were sold on March 9 prior to the Credit Suisse deal rather than at market prices, compensating investors after a sell-off this week.

""They're trying to be friendly to investors who purchased just before the mess,"" said Jerome Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments, a fund which owned Credit Suisse AT1 bonds.

UBS in a statement said it was buying back a 1.5 billion-euro 4.625% fixed-rate note due March 2028 and a 1.25 billion-euro 4.750% fixed rate note due March 2032.

The notes are loss-absorbing senior unsecured bail-in notes.

Credit rating agency S&P revised its outlook on the holding company of UBS, the issuer of the bonds, to negative from stable on Monday, reflecting pressure on creditworthiness linked to the Credit Suisse deal.

Moody's cut its ratings outlook across UBS' entities to negative, while Fitch placed them on ""watch negative"".

UBS shares and bonds have seesawed this week as investors assess the impact of the Credit Suisse deal.

On Monday the shares fell by as much as 17% only to close 35% higher than those lows on Tuesday. UBS bonds also tumbled, with its AT1 debt taking a big hit in particular on Monday.

Credit Suisse AT1 bondholders weren't compensated, which the bank's AT1 prospectus spelled out could happen in Switzerland, but markets were still surprised, being used to seeing bondholders rank higher than equity holders who are to receive the value of the share offer.

The prices of the bonds UBS is buying back on Wednesday had also tumbled but partially recovered on Tuesday. ,

They rallied further following Wednesday's announcement. The price of the March 2032 bond was up just under a point on the day as prices on both bonds rose near to the levels UBS is offering to pay bondholders, Tradeweb data showed.

""The issuer has decided to launch this exercise as a result of a prudent assessment of these recent developments and the issuer's long-term commitment to its credit investors,"" UBS said in its statement.

UBS buyback bonds

The buyback was ""fair"" given the market volatility since the bonds were sold, a banker involved with the sale of the bonds said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

UBS shares closed down 3.7% at 18.71 Swiss francs ($21.05), having risen as much as 3.6% earlier.

The Swiss National Council and the Council of States are debating the emergency rescue of Credit Suisse in a special session starting today and running through Thursday. A hot topic is the domination of the Swiss banking industry by a single major bank that could develop concentrated market power in certain industry segments.

The FDP wants to ensure the new megabank is reduced in size, with SVP National Councilor and banker Thomas Matter singing from the same song sheet. There should no longer be a single Swiss bank whose bankruptcy is so systemically important that it has to be rescued by the state or taxpayers.

Waiting for the Weko

The demands of the centrist party are somewhat less stringent. According to its parliamentary group leader Philipp Matthias Bregy, it does not want to stop the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS. First, however, there must be a financial strategy and questions of competition law must be clarified by the Competition Commission (Weko).

Then UBS would be free to decide whether to submit to the stricter regulation for big banks or to downsize.

Rising Clamor

Amid all the clamor, it seems to be forgotten the parliament cannot thwart the merger of UBS and Credit Suisse.

Before the takeover is finally approved, the hands of the politicians are tied. The authorities, for their part, have already approved the merger under emergency law, which can only be applied for six months.

Political Tug-of-War

It is entirely up to UBS whether it integrates Credit Suisse completely, spins off part of it, targets an IPO, or takes any other decision regarding the future of the defunct Credit Suisse.

However, there could still be a political tug-of-war after the merger goes through, as finews.com reported.",[],2023-04-11 12:35:21
https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/our-approach/marketnews/article.1585717.html,Let's chat about ChatGPT,"We view ChatGPT-3 as the current leader in a fast growing market that will see significant investment and development by leading, large technology companies globally. Like prior technology developments, we believe artificial intelligence (AI) will ultimately be additive to employment and economic growth.

No, this wasn’t written by ChatGPT…but it probably could have been

ChatGPT-3 is a chatbot developed by OpenAI, a US-based artificial intelligence research lab. Many consumers are familiar with chatbots, but less so with the underlying technology. ChatGPT-3 uses a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) to generate text that is largely identical to human conversation. GPT is part of the broader family of large language models, which are AI models that understand and can generate text.

Large language models are compelling because of their flexibility. With minimal training, large language models can complete sentences, translate a foreign language, summarize information from multiple sources, and generate content ranging from technical answers to humorous vignettes.

Enormous amounts of data from a range of sources are used in the training process. ChatGPT-3 ingested content from books, academic papers, and the entirety of Wikipedia. According to OpenAI, ChatGPT-3 was trained on over 45 terabytes of data. The system iteratively and without supervision learned to predict the next word in a sequence of text. This unsupervised learning required a network of distributed computers, which allowed for a faster learning process than could have been accomplished using a single computer. The combination of a vast amount of ingested data and massive computing power resulted in a model with 175 billion parameters, making it one of the largest language models ever created. Parameters in large language models are essentially the values that the model is solving.

Use cases, from the source

Rather than speculate ourselves, we asked ChatGPT for some potential use cases. Here’s its response:

“ChatGPT has many potential use cases including chatbots for customer service and mental health support, personal assistants, content creation, language translation, knowledge management, and education/training.”

We see ChatGPT as an engine that will eventually power human interactions with computer systems in a familiar, natural, and intuitive way. As ChatGPT stated, large language models can be put to work as a communication engine in a variety of applications across a number of vertical markets.

Glaringly absent in its answer is the use of ChatGPT in search engines. Microsoft, which is an investor in OpenAI, is integrating ChatGPT into its Bing search engine. The use of a large language model enables more complex and more natural searches and extract deeper meaning and better context from source material. This is ultimately expected to deliver more robust and useful results.

Is AI coming for your job?

Every wave of new and disruptive technology has incited fears of mass job losses due to automation, and we are already seeing those fears expressed relative to AI generally and ChatGPT specifically. The year 1896, when Henry Ford rolled out his first automobile, was probably not a good year for buggy whip makers. When IBM introduced its first mainframe, the System/360, in 1964, office workers feared replacement by mechanical brains that never made mistakes, never called in sick, and never took vacations.

There are certainly historical cases of job displacement due to new technology adoption, and ChatGPT may unseat some office workers or customer service reps. However, we think AI tools broadly will end up as part of the solution in an economy that has more job openings than available workers.

However, economic history shows that technology of any sort (i.e., manufacturing technology, communications technology, information technology) ultimately makes productive workers more productive and is net additive to employment and economic growth.

How big is the opportunity?

The broad AI hardware and services market was nearly USD 36bn in 2020, based on IDC and Bloomberg Intelligence data. We expect the market to grow by 20% CAGR to reach USD 90bn by 2025. Given the relatively early monetization stage of conversational AI, we estimate that the segment accounted for 10% of the broader AI’s addressable market in 2020, predominantly from enterprise and consumer subscriptions.

That said, user adoption is rapidly rising. ChatGPT reached its first 1 million user milestone in a week, surpassing Instagram to become the quickest application to do so. Similarly, we see strong interest from enterprises to integrate conservational AI into their existing ecosystem. As a result, we believe conversational AI’s share in the broader AI’s addressable market can climb to 20% by 2025 (USD 18–20bn). Our estimate may prove to be conservative; they could be even higher if conversational AI improvements (in terms of computing power, machine learning, and deep learning capabilities), availability of talent, enterprise adoption, spending from governments, and incentives are stronger than expected.

How to invest in AI?

We see artificial intelligence as a horizontal technology that will have important use cases across a number of applications and industries. From a broader perspective, AI, along with big data and cybersecurity, forms what we call the ABCs of technology. We believe these three major foundational technologies are at inflection points and should see faster adoption over the next few years as enterprises and governments increase their focus and investments in these areas.

Conservational AI is currently in its early stages of monetization and costs remain high as it is expensive to run. Instead of investing directly in such platforms, interested investors in the short term can consider semiconductor companies, and cloud-service providers that provides the infrastructure needed for generative AI to take off. In the medium to long term, companies can integrate generative AI to improve margins across industries and sectors, such as within healthcare and traditional manufacturing.

Outside of public equities, investors can also consider opportunities in private equity (PE). We believe the tech sector is currently undergoing a new innovation cycle after 12–18 months of muted activity, which provides interesting and new opportunities that PE can capture through early-stage investments.

UBS certainly got a good price. The $3.2 billion in stock it agreed to pay for Credit Suisse’s equity, less than half the company’s market value last Friday and just 7% of its tangible book value, is the headline number. Then there is the controversial write-off of Credit Suisse’s $17 billion in AT1 bonds. The lawsuits will come, but the decision was taken by the Swiss regulator rather than UBS, so the bank shouldn’t have to bear any costs.",['Stephen Wilmot'],

BERN, March 19 (Reuters) - UBS (UBSG.S) agreed to buy rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.23 billion) in stock and agreed to assume up to 5 billion francs ($5.4 billion) in losses, in a shotgun merger engineered by Swiss authorities to avoid more market-shaking turmoil in global banking.

The deal includes 100 billion Swiss francs ($108 billion) in liquidity assistance for UBS and Credit Suisse from the Swiss central bank.

To enable UBS to take over Credit Suisse, the federal government is providing a loss guarantee of a maximum of 9 billion Swiss francs for a clearly defined part of the portfolio, the government said.

This will be activated if losses are actually incurred on this portfolio. In that eventuality, UBS would assume the first 5 billion francs, the federal government the next 9 billion francs, and UBS would assume any further losses, the government said.

Switzerland's regulator FINMA said that there was a risk that Credit Suisse could have become ""illiquid, even if it remained solvent, and it was necessary for the authorities to take action"".

Credit Suisse Additional Tier 1 shares with a nominal value of around 16 billion francs ($17.2 billion) will be written down completely after the Swiss government provided support for UBS' takeover of Credit Suisse, FINMA said.

The 167-year-old Credit Suisse has been the biggest name ensnared in market turmoil unleashed by the recent collapse of U.S. lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, forcing it to tap $54 billion in central bank funding last week.

""With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,"" the Swiss central bank said.

Authorities had been scrambling to rescue Credit Suisse, among the world's largest wealth managers, before financial markets reopened on Monday.

UBS and Credit Suisse are both in a group of the 30 global systemically important banks watched closely by regulators, and Credit Suisse's failure would ripple throughout the entire financial system.

The announcement came in a make-or-break weekend after some rivals grew cautious in their dealings with the struggling Swiss lender, and its regulators urged it to pursue a deal with UBS.

FINMA, which said it had approved the takeover, said recent measures to stabilize itself were ""not enough to restore confidence in the bank, however, and more far-reaching options were also examined.""

The two banks' fortunes have diverged sharply over the past year. UBS earned $7.6 billion in profit in 2022, while Credit Suisse lost $7.9 billion. Credit Suisse's shares are down 74% from a year ago, while UBS's are relatively flat.

The Swiss government said that it was also giving UBS a guarantee of 9 billion Swiss francs ""assume potential losses"" from assets as part of the transaction.

UBS's chief executive officer Ralph Hamers and Chairman Colm Kelleher will remain at the helm of the combined bank.

""The transaction reinforces UBS's position as the leading universal bank in Switzerland,"" UBS said.

Executives foreshadowed structural changes in the offing.

Kelleher said it would wrap up running Credit Suisse's investment bank, but added that it was too early to say anything about potential job cuts.

Kelleher also said they would keep Credit Suisse's domestic business, despite speculation that it could be spun off amid competition concerns.

Credit Suisse's Chairman Axel Lehmann called the merger the ""best available outcome"".

https://kalkinemedia.com/au/news/politics-and-international-affairs/federal-reserve-approves-ubs-credit-suisse-deal-in-us,Federal Reserve approves UBS-Credit Suisse deal in US,"By Hannah Lang, Chris Prentice and Ann Saphir

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's Board of Governors on Friday said it has approved UBS Group AG's acquisition of the U.S. subsidiaries of Credit Suisse, clearing the way for the Swiss-brokered deal in the U.S.

UBS has committed to give the U.S. central bank an implementation plan for combining its U.S. business and operations with those of Credit Suisse, the Fed's Board said in a statement. The plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution, the statement said.

The U.S. central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers that would create an institution with total assets of more than $250 billion. The Fed's approval of UBS's application clears a key hurdle for the shotgun merger between the two banks orchestrated last month by the Swiss central bank. After years of scandal and losses, 167-year-old Credit Suisse came to the brink of collapse before Zurich-based rival UBS rode to the rescue with a merger engineered and bankrolled by the Swiss authorities last month. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value. UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets. Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion. The Fed subjects firms with more than $700 billion in assets, or more than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activities, to heightened supervision, including annual company-run stress tests and increased liquidity standards.

https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/our-approach/marketnews/article.1582167.html,2023 energy outlook: Favoring crude oil,"Crude oil: Still constructive

We expect crude oil prices to rise in 2023 for several reasons. With China reopening, oil demand looks set to exceed 2019 levels and hit a record high in 2H23. Emerging Asia, including India, should return to driving oil demand growth in 2023. Meanwhile, Russian oil production should fall in 2023 due to the European Union's embargo on Russian crude and refined products (to come into force on 5 February). While production outside the OPEC+ group, which is primarily driven by the US, will likely grow again in 2023, the increase should only be modest following years of underinvestment in building new supply.



So, to keep the market in balance, we expect OPEC+ to ease their production cuts once again in 2023 and provide more barrels to the market to cover rising oil demand amid less Russian production. With OECD oil inventories (commercial and strategic) standing at the lowest level since 2004 and spare capacity set to keep dwindling in 2023, we continue to believe higher prices are needed to slow down oil demand growth and encourage investments in new production.

We therefore continue to expect oil prices to move above USD 100/bbl over the coming months, with Brent trading at USD 110/bbl at mid-2023 and end 2023 (WTI USD 107/bbl).



Given our positive price outlook, we reiterate our investment recommendations. With the oil futures curve downward sloped (in backwardation) and higher prices likely ahead, we continue to advise risk-taking investors to add long positions in longer-dated Brent oil contracts. Alternatively, investors can make use of lower spot prices and high option implied volatility by selling Brent’s downside price risks over the next six months. Another way to gain exposure is through Brent crude oil first generation indices. Such strategies should benefit from solid roll returns on top of the expected spot appreciation. We set our stop-loss at USD 75/bbl, targeting a level of USD 110/bbl. But considering oil’s volatility of more than 40%, this strategy requires investors to have an elevated risk appetite.

Muted supply growth in non-OPEC+

On the supply side, the US should lead production growth outside of OPEC+ in 2023, with the usual suspect—Brazil, Norway, and Guyana—also increasing production. We expect non-OPEC+ to add around 1.3mbpd in 2023. But the US supply additions will likely be smaller compared to historical patterns. Back in 2018, when oil prices were significantly below today’s levels, US oil production rose by 2.2mbpd—crude rose by nearly 1.6mbpd, and natural gas liquid (NGL) production increased by nearly 0.6mbpd; production of the latter is driven by more factors than just oil prices. In 2022, with oil prices at a multi-year high, US crude production rose by only 0.5mbpd (total oil production: 1.1mbpd, with NGL contributing nearly 0.6mbpd).

A big reason is because the supply response from US oil producers with short lead cycles (i.e., shale oil) to higher prices is different now than in the past. Shale producers are more focused on capital discipline today—such as reducing debts or paying higher dividends—instead of increasing production growth. Another factor limiting growth is the fast rise in costs due to elevated inflation, a tight US labor market, and other supply chain constraints. These factors are likely to slow production growth in 2023 as well, limiting US crude production growth to 0.6mbpd in 2023, in our view (total oil production: 0.9mbpd, with NGL contributing 0.3mbpd).

Holding a positive outlook

In sum, supply growth from non-OPEC+ should trail demand growth, making the world once again dependent on more oil from OPEC+. And with OECD inventories (commercial and strategic) at the lowest level since 2004 and spare capacity set to keep dwindling, higher prices are likely needed to help balance markets.

UBS agreed to buy its embattled rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion) Sunday, with Swiss regulators playing a key part in the deal as governments looked to stem a contagion threatening the global banking system.

""With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,"" read a statement from the Swiss National Bank, which noted the central bank worked with the Swiss government and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority to bring about the combination of the country's two largest banks.

The terms of the deal will see Credit Suisse shareholders receive 1 UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares they hold.

""This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue. We have structured a transaction which will preserve the value left in the business while limiting our downside exposure,"" said UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher in a statement.

The combined bank will have $5 trillion of invested assets, according to UBS.

""We are committed to making this deal a great success. There are no options in this,"" Kelleher said when asked during the press conference if the bank could back out of the deal. ""This is absolutely essential to the financial structure of Switzerland and ... to global finance.""

The Swiss National Bank pledged a loan of up to 100 billion Swiss francs ($108 billion) to support the takeover.

From a current retail store base of 940,000 locations, at least 50,000 doors are estimated to close over the next five years, based on new data from UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser. That estimate presumes retail sales growth of 4 percent annually and e-commerce penetration up from 20 percent to 26 percent by Fiscal Year 2027. But a protracted recession where retail sales grow just 3 to 3.5 percent annually would place downward pressure on closures, raising the forecast to 70,000 to 90,000 locations.

The last time the tally for store closures shot up was in 2020, following the Covid outbreak when more than 11,000 fashion-related doors shuttered after many banners ended up in bankruptcy.

Post-Covid, the costs of doing business for retailers has gone up, mostly due to higher hourly wages, the largest component in running a store. And with retail rents per square foot also up 1.8 percent, the overall costs keep climbing, increasing the “hurdle rate to keep stores open.” This comes with an inflationary backdrop that is far from kind for retail in general.

Lasser and the UBS retail team, including softlines analyst Jay Sole, on Tuesday disclosed in a report that the pace of store consolidation is “set to accelerate” due to a slowdown in consumer spending, a reduction in the availability of credit and a rise in the penetration of e-commerce. That would mean a minimum of 5 percent fewer stores in the U.S., excluding gas and food service, by the end of 2027 and presuming there is no prolonged recession.

Who will benefit? Large, well-capitalized retailers such as Walmart, Target and Costco, or specialty chains with a unique point of differentiation, such as Academy Sports and Outdoors. Another that could take market share from weaker competitors exiting the market is Dick’s Sporting Goods. The analysts estimate that average sales per store is $5.7 million, putting $285 billion of retail sales “up for grabs,” presuming 50,000 doors close. If 26 percent of sales move online, that would leave $210 billion in sales, or $1,600 in annual spend per household, that could shift to retailers such as Walmart, Target or Costco. All three also have robust online channels, as well as enhanced digital fulfillment capabilities.

Not surprisingly, retailers most at risk for closure are smaller chains, and doors operated by independents due to their limited access to the capital needed to develop a robust omnichannel offering. UBS proprietary data indicated that smaller chains shed 40,000 stores in the past 10 years, while retailers with over 500 employees added 17,000 doors. The data points also show that store closures accelerated five quarters after banks began to pull back on credit. Currently, banks are reporting a 20 to 30 percent decline in willingness to make consumer installment loans, the UBS report said. The analysts see this as a leading indicator of store closures going forward. Households with less capital to spend on goods also mean fewer entrepreneurs will have the wherewithal to create new retail businesses.

By subsector, a minimum of 14,000 apparel and accessories stores—12 percent of the current base of 119,062 doors—could close, and that’s on top of the 10,612 doors that have shuttered since the first quarter of 2018. Going back to the fourth quarter of 2007, the apparel store base has declined 17 percent.

In addition, 4,000 home furnishings locations, or 9 percent of the current base of 47,769 could close, on top of the 2,142 closures since the first quarter of 2018. The count for home furnishings is high because furniture and bedding are discretionary categories that have a high percentage of sales that are financed, the UBS analysts concluded.

Most at risk are retailers with a large number of stores in shopping malls. And within softlines, store closures at department stores and specialty retailers are expected to surpass the recent trend in store openings. That would mean brands that have a strong direct-to-consumer focus such as Nike and Levi Strauss should do well. Also cited was American Eagle Outfitters, considered a strong omnichannel retailer.

“We remain bearish on Nordstrom, Kohl’s, Macy’s and Dillard’s,” the analysts concluded. Regional chains, mostly with locations in shopping malls, are expected to “continue closing stores and potentially go out of business,” the report said. Meanwhile, department stores are expected to continue to lose customers to off-price retailers.",['Vicki M. Young'],2023-04-11 20:42:19+00:00

On a recent trip to Singapore, Iqbal Khan, the head of global wealth management at UBS met with Puneet Matta, the head of Credit Suisse's local wealth unit in the city-state. He said that UBS would likely keep the wealth business in India, according to a «Bloomberg» (behind paywall) story, citing people familiar.

While the decision on keeping the private banking unit in the UBS fold after its March 19 takeover of Credit Suisse is not final, retaining it would mark a return to a market it left in 2014. Khan ran the business for Credit Suisse before he left for UBS in 2019.

A drop in crude inventories and supply disruption from northern Iraq of almost 500,000 barrels per day are also supporting prices that could rally towards the $100 mark, UBS said in its latest oil market report on Tuesday.

“While flows may resume [from Iraq] in the short term, the interruption and the upcoming voluntary production cuts by nine oil producers should help tighten the oil market further,” UBS said in report co-authored by its strategists Giovanni Staunovo, Wayne Gordon and Dominic Schnider.

“As a result, we continue to expect oil prices to recover towards $100 per barrel over the coming quarters.”

Opec+ members including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman and Algeria on April 2 surprised the market and said they would introduce combined voluntary oil production cuts of 1.16 million barrels per day from May until the end of this year.

Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter and Opec's largest producer, will cut its output by 500,000 bpd from May until the end of the year, while the UAE will cut its output by 144,000 bpd for the same period.

Russia, which is part of the 23-member Opec+ group, said the 500,000 bpd cut it was implementing from March to June would continue until the end of the year.

The producers said the precautionary measure was aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market.

The latest pledge of cuts by Opec+, which slashed its collective output by two million barrels per day in October last year, has pushed the volume of the group’s production caps to about 3.6 million bpd, about 3.6 per cent of Opec’s 101.9 million bpd estimated world oil demand this year.

Goldman Sachs, which had reduced its oil price forecast for 2023 on growing supplies and lower demand, now expects Brent to trade at $95 a barrel by the end of this year from a previous $90 estimate, and $100 in 2024 compared with a prior $97 forecast.

The investment bank expects a nearly 90 per cent implementation rate for the 1.16 million bpd combined cut, as the countries that announced them “have a strong compliance track record” and had implemented nearly 90 per cent of the October 2022 cut by January 2023, the investment bank said earlier this month.

Crude prices have rebounded from a 15-month low hit last month due to a banking crisis in the US that spread to Switzerland, leading to the collapse of four lenders and sparking a broad sell-off in financial markets.

Brent, the benchmark for two thirds of the world’s oil, settled 1.7 per cent higher at $85.61 a barrel at the close of trading on Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate, the gauge that tracks US crude, closed up 2.2 per cent at $81.53 a barrel.

Oil is still up about 6 per cent since the Opec+ surprise announcement. However, traders are awaiting data on inflation and economy that will indicate global economic sentiment and potential demand for oil in the quarters to come.

“Given our positive price outlook, we reiterate our investment recommendations,” the UBS strategists said.

“With the oil futures curve downwards sloping (in backwardation) and higher prices likely ahead, we continue to advise risk-taking investors to add long positions in longer-dated Brent oil contracts.”

Falling inventories amid a rise in demand as China's economy, the second-largest in the world after the US, will also support crude prices.

“More interesting is the fall in inventories following the strong rise at the start of the year, which was likely driven by the dip in January demand due to mild weather and recovering production from weather disruptions in December,” UBS said.

However, February data suggested a strong increase in demand, resulting in a modestly undersupplied market that month, it added.

“More recent data shows renewed large on-land inventory drops of more than 30 million barrels over the last three weeks across the US, Europe, Singapore, Japan and Fujairah, suggesting that the market remained undersupplied in March as well,” it said.","['Sarmad Khan', 'Apr']",2023-04-12 00:00:00

UBS took over Credit Suisse on Sunday in a £2.65bn deal forced through by Swiss authorities amid fears that a failure to protect depositors would kickstart a global banking crisis.

In a letter to staff seen by the Guardian, the Credit Suisse group chief executive, Ulrich Körner, said it had “been an emotional and challenging week for all of us. He thanked employees for their “unwavering commitment and for the support you have given our clients and each other during this difficult time”.

Korner said the deal with UBS had been the “only viable option” and it “brings both stability and certainty to our clients and to the market”.

Switzerland’s government said earlier this week that Credit Suisse was ordered to temporarily suspend bonus payments awarded in the years up to 2022.

In the letter, Körner acknowledged concerns about the ban among its 45,000-strong workforce and said discussions concerning the matter with Swiss authorities were “ongoing”. There are more than 5,000 Credit Suisse and about 6,000 UBS staff based in London. “We do not yet have an answer, but we know how important this is for many of you,” he said.

Korner said that a deal of the scale of the UBS merger would typically take six months to agree, but the emergency transaction had taken just four days, leaving many practicalities unresolved.

He said: “Until the transaction legally closes later this year, we remain two independent banks and must continue to work that way. Please stay focused on our clients and continue to provide them with the outstanding service they expect from us.”

Körner, who become chief executive in July 2022 after former boss Thomas Gottstein was ousted, said he remains “fully committed” to the bank. “I will be at your side as we work to make the transaction a success,” he said.

The UBS deal was agreed after it became clear the $54bn loan to Credit Suisse from the Swiss central bank had failed to halt a sharp slide in its share price.

The note preceded the Federal Reserve's 25 basis-point benchmark rate increase on Wednesday, but UBS had already assumed the central bank would continue to hike in their monthly update. Markets quickly soured after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments following the rate hike decision. Powell noted that, while credit conditions are tightening, the central bank had no plans to cut rates anytime soon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank more than 500 points Wednesday, while the S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slid more than 1% each. The Fed is in a tight spot. It is simultaneously trying to avoid more fallout from the disorder within the banking system while addressing inflation. Because of this, UBS thinks stocks are likely to remain volatile, and investors should turn to quality names to ride out the storm.

""In this context, our tactical themes are focused on high quality companies, those that have pricing power, or are leveraged to long-term growth drivers that are more insulated from economic growth."" UBS highlighted four stock baskets that investors should turn their attention to, including one titled ""Time for quality."" It consists of companies viewed as ""high quality"" due to noteworthy returns on invested capital, which typically outperform peers when the economy slows down and nears a recession.

UBS also highlighted the company's ability to lean into new technology as well as well-received promotions and higher quality menu items.

MCD 1Y mountain MCD 12-month chart Oil giant Exxon Mobil also made the list, with UBS pointing to the company's exceptionally strong balance sheet. UBS said should see a rise in cash flow as the company continues to complete projects. Starbucks , meanwhile, should benefit largely from the re-opening of China and the relaxation of Covid-19 lockdown policies there. UBS also noted that Starbucks is successfully addressing inflation through ""targeted pricing, operating efficiencies, and prioritization of discretionary spend."" Shares of the coffee chain are flat year to date, but they've popped more than 17% over the last six months. Microsoft also made the list. This comes on the heels of of the success of OpenAI's ChatGPT, and an integration of the chat box into Bing. UBS expects the company to continue to notch wins from growing further into the cloud market and highlighted its secure profit margins. Microsoft shares have ripped more than 16% higher in 2023.

""Switzerland's standing as a financial centre is shattered,"" Octavio Marenzi, CEO of Opimas, said in a research note. ""The country will now be viewed as a financial banana republic.""

""The Credit Suisse debacle will have serious ramifications for other Swiss financial institutions. A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,"" Marenzi said. A spokesperson for the Swiss regulator FINMA declined to comment. Shares of Swiss-listed UBS on Tuesday rose 7.3% by around 12:50 p.m. London time (8:50 a.m. ET), extending gains after closing higher in the previous session. Credit Suisse traded up 3.5% during afternoon deals after ending Monday's session down a whopping 55%.

Credit Suisse bond wipeout

Under the terms of the emergency takeover, investors in Credit Suisse's additional tier-one bonds — widely regarded as a relatively risky investment — will see the value of their holdings slashed to zero. It means investments worth roughly 16 billion francs will become worthless. AT1 bonds, also known as contingent convertibles or ""CoCos,"" are a type of debt that is considered part of a bank's regulatory capital. Holders can convert them into equity or write them down in certain situations – for example when a bank's capital ratio falls below a previously agreed threshold. ""The extraordinary government support will trigger a complete write-down of the nominal value of all AT1 debt of Credit Suisse in the amount of around CHF 16 billion, and thus an increase in core capital,"" FINMA said Sunday.

The unconventional move is at odds with the typical practice of prioritizing bondholders over shareholders when a bank fails and prompted turmoil in the market for convertible bank bonds on Monday. Vítor Constâncio, who served as the vice president of the European Central Bank from 2010 to 2018, said via Twitter that FINMA's announcement was a ""mistake with consequences and potentially a host of court cases."" The ECB and Britain's Bank of England both sought to distance themselves from FINMA's decision.

European Union regulators, composed of the ECB, the European Banking Authority and the Single Resolution Board, said Monday that they would continue to impose losses on shareholders before bondholders. ""This approach has been consistently applied in past cases and will continue to guide the actions of the SRB and ECB banking supervision in crisis interventions,"" they said. The Bank of England echoed this sentiment shortly thereafter. ""Holders of such instruments should expect to be exposed to losses in resolution or insolvency in the order of their positions in this hierarchy,"" the BOE said.

What about the Swiss franc as a safe haven?

March 23 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse AG (CSGN.S) and UBS group AG (UBSG.S) are under scrutiny in a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) probe into whether financial professionals helped Russian oligarchs evade sanctions, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.

The DOJ also sent subpoenas to employees of some major U.S. banks, the Bloomberg report said, adding the Swiss banks were included in a wave of subpoenas sent before Credit Suisse's takeover by UBS.

The DOJ inquiries are to identify which bank employees dealt with sanctioned clients and how those clients were vetted over past years, Bloomberg reported.

The bankers may then be further investigated to determine if they broke any laws, the report added.

Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment while the Justice Department did not immediately respond to Reuters' emailed requests for comment.

The DOJ has been trying to pressure Russian oligarchs through sanctions, asset seizures and criminal probes to stop backing Russian President Vladimir Putin after the country's invasion of Ukraine.

The Justice Department charged Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska last year with violating sanctions by using the U.S. financial system to maintain three luxury properties.

The Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors on Friday said it has approved UBS Group’s acquisition of the U.S. subsidiaries of Credit Suisse, clearing another major hurdle for the completion of the Swiss-brokered rescue deal.

UBS has committed to give the U.S. central bank an implementation plan for combining its U.S. business and operations with those of Credit Suisse within three months of consummating the deal, the Fed’s Board said in a statement. The plan will include more stringent requirements including liquidity standards for the bank, due to the increased size of the institution, the statement said.

The U.S. central bank is required to conduct a review of bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more.

UBS had requested the Fed’s approval of the merger March 22, the Fed said.

After years of scandal and losses, 167-year-old Credit Suisse came to the brink of collapse before Zurich-based rival UBS rode to the rescue with a merger engineered and bankrolled by the Swiss authorities last month. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value.

The Swiss authorities and UBS Group AG have been racing to close the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG within as little as a month, in an effort to retain the lender’s clients and employees, Reuters previously reported.

UBS secured a temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators earlier this month but still needs to seek clearance under EU merger rules. The Bank of England has approved the takeover in the United Kingdom, people familiar with the process told Reuters.

UBS has said it expects the deal to create a business with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Under the takeover deal, holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will get nothing, while shareholders, who usually rank below bondholders in compensation terms, will receive $3.23 billion.

The Fed subjects firms with more than $700 billion in assets, or more than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activities, to heightened supervision, including annual company-run stress tests and increased liquidity standards.

Michela Tindera

It started with a simple question.

Interview clip

I’m wondering whether you would be open to assisting further if there was another call for additional liquidity from Credit Suisse.

Michela Tindera

That question was for the then chairman of Saudi National Bank, Ammar Alkhudairy. He sat down for a television interview on Wednesday, March 15th. Saudi National Bank had recently become the largest investor in the prestigious yet troubled bank Credit Suisse. And the FT’s banking editor, Stephen Morris, says a lot was riding on how he responded.

Ammar Alkhudairy

The answer is absolutely not.

Michela Tindera

This interview was taking place just a few days after Silicon Valley Bank failed and the entire global banking system had been put into question.

Stephen Morris

Those comments really set off a firestorm of media attention, client withdrawals, share price falling, its bonds plunging to trade at distressed levels. A lot of people, both inside and outside the bank, link these comments as being the proximate cause of Credit Suisse’s demise.

Michela Tindera

After these comments came out, things started to look so bad for Credit Suisse that it seemed like they could go bankrupt. And a Credit Suisse collapse could have been the tipping point for havoc in the entire global financial system.

Stephen Morris

If it goes bankrupt, we’ll have chaos in financial markets. It’s a huge bank with connections throughout the financial system, including to other banks, hedge funds, ordinary depositors. It would have been absolute carnage. So the stakes couldn’t really be higher.

Michela Tindera

So how did it avoid absolute carnage? Just look across town in Zurich to Credit Suisse’s top rival, UBS.

Stephen Morris

Well, if you’d asked me, I guess two months ago, if the Swiss would ever allow their two largest banks to merge, I would have said no.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Michela Tindera

I’m Michela Tindera from the Financial Times. Today on Behind the Money, we’re bringing you the inside story of how two Swiss banks and their government raced against the clock to avoid a global banking meltdown.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

UBS has been Credit Suisse’s closest rival for years, in more ways than one.

Stephen Morris

These two banks have sat there for centuries on the same square in the centre of Zurich called Paradeplatz. They’re both on different sides of the square, both looking out into the centre, kind of facing each other, but also kind of next to each other. The style of the buildings are very different. UBS’s has been redesigned and is sleek and modern and glass and metal, whereas Credit Suisse’s is much more old, grandiose architecture, small, narrow warren-like corridors and more old Switzerland than new.

Michela Tindera

UBS’s takeover of Credit Suisse is the culmination of a rivalry that’s existed for a long time. But well before UBS would eventually rescue Credit Suisse, things looked quite different. Let me take you back about 15 years, back to the beginning of the global financial crisis, where a lot of the stories on this show have their origins.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

So it’s 2008 and UBS is in some hot water.

Stephen Morris

UBS was the bad boy of Swiss banking.

Michela Tindera

At the time, UBS is Switzerland’s largest bank. And essentially it’s a mess. It’s posting big losses and writedowns. Investors are losing confidence, and Switzerland’s reputation as a banking haven is taking a hit. That all comes to a head in October 2008.

Stephen Morris

It had to be bailed out by the government.

Michela Tindera

The Swiss government pumps billions into the bank to help recapitalise it, and that makes Swiss taxpayers very unhappy. Meanwhile, UBS’s rival Credit Suisse makes it out alive, receiving new capital from private investors instead of the government.

Stephen Morris

Credit Suisse survived. Credit Suisse was the good one.

Michela Tindera

So 2008 comes and goes and UBS has a lot of work to do to get back on track.

Stephen Morris

UBS learnt some very hard lessons, removed all of its management, largely shut down the trading and risky operations of its investment bank, focused on wealth management and then spent the best part of the next, I would say, five to 10 years cleaning up scandals, overturning the risk culture of the group and generally trying to amend for the wrongs that it had done to Swiss citizens and Switzerland’s reputation as a country.

Michela Tindera

UBS emerged from the financial crisis humbled. And Credit Suisse may have seemed untouchable, but Stephen says there’s an often used maxim in finance that would foreshadow the events to come.

Stephen Morris

If you wanna look at the banks that will get into trouble in the next crisis, it’s not gonna be the ones that failed in the last one. It’s gonna be the ones that didn’t and weren’t forced to make, you know, tough changes and perhaps got a little bit overconfident.

Michela Tindera

And fast forward to 2023. Now, these two rivals have swapped places.

Stephen Morris

UBS has largely repaired itself. Its share price is good. Its leadership is stable. Its strategy is generally liked by the market. And Credit Suisse is the basketcase, with a new scandal coming out every week damaging its reputation.

Michela Tindera

Late last year on the show, I talked with the FT’s European banking correspondent, Owen Walker, about a lot of Credit Suisse’s troubles. During that episode, Owen outlined the bank’s latest gameplan. It included things like severe cost-cutting and selling off its investment banking division. But that plan crashed and burned.

Stephen Morris

It wasn’t enough. It wasn’t convincing enough in terms of a change in strategy, and it wasn’t executed fast enough. Credit Suisse has had, I think now, three restructuring plans in the last two years and I think seven in the last decade. So very few of their restructuring plans have ever actually worked and turned the bank around and turned it into a profitable, well-run, honourable institution.

Michela Tindera

Credit Suisse was facing a crisis of confidence. Even so, it did manage to get an infusion of money from a big new investor late last year.

Stephen Morris

The Saudi National Bank — very deep pocketed, strong links to the state. And it was intended to be a new cornerstone investor to take out all those people shorting its stock and to back them.

Michela Tindera

So the bank had some reprieve going into this year. But just a few months in, Silicon Valley Bank collapses.

Stephen Morris

And that puts the whole market on edge. So Credit Suisse at this point is fragile. It can’t afford any more mis-steps.

Michela Tindera

And then Credit Suisse starts to have this PR issue with the then chairman of the Saudi National Bank.

Stephen Morris

He goes on television at Saudi Arabia’s big financials conference and is asked by a journalist, if Credit Suisse needs any more capital, considering the market jitters, would you put any more in? And he answers, “Absolutely not.”

Michela Tindera

That’s the clip from March 15th that you heard at the beginning of the episode.

Stephen Morris

He then does go on to qualify and talk about regulatory reasons, and says he doesn’t think Credit Suisse needs any more capital. But that is the kind of snapshot that everyone, journalists around the world report.

Michela Tindera

So suddenly in the middle of all this banking chaos, it looks like Credit Suisse’s biggest shareholder isn’t backing it.

Stephen Morris

And that, I think, really is the catalyst for clients to lose even more faith.

Michela Tindera

After that interview airs on Wednesday, things turn from bad to worse.

News clip

Credit Suisse appears to be the latest on the brink . . .

News clip

Shares in Credit Suisse plunged to a record low, falling 24 per cent.

Michela Tindera

It’s all happening really fast — so fast that the very same day the Swiss central bank decides it needs to step in to prevent a catastrophe. So the top execs at Credit Suisse — that’s Ulrich Körner, the CEO, and Axel Lehmann, the chairman — are summoned to the country’s central bank.

Stephen Morris

And they were told that they were gonna be getting this liquidity line, which they’d been lobbying for, which they thought was great.

Michela Tindera

That liquidity line was SFr50bn. So maybe Credit Suisse is out of the woods after all?

Stephen Morris

But however, in the same meeting, the central bank delivered a very different message, which a person who was involved remembers, told the FT: You will merge with UBS and you will announce this on Sunday evening before the Asian market opens. And this is not optional. So they were given an ultimatum. This credit line was not to save Credit Suisse. It was to stave off bankruptcy until the weekend so they could merge with UBS.

Michela Tindera

Wow. So let’s recap here. Essentially what’s just happened is the central bank, along with the regulator Finma and the country’s finance minister, have given Credit Suisse this deadline. The bank has just four days — Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday — to work out a deal to merge with its top rival before Asian markets open on Monday.

Stephen Morris

The stakes are incredibly high because over the previous weekend, Silicon Valley Bank has to be saved by a combination of US regulators and private companies. Now we’re going into another weekend with a much larger, globally systemic financial institution, as Credit Suisse is known, could potentially go bankrupt.

Michela Tindera

So what happened next? So Credit Suisse knows that they have to merge with UBS. Does UBS know this?

Stephen Morris

UBS doesn’t know this yet, but they have their suspicions. The chairman of UBS is a very interesting character, a guy called Colm Kelleher — Irish, but very American in his outlook. He’s an irascible character. Yeah, very smart and very well thought of in global markets. And he has been preparing behind the scenes for an emergency 9-1-1 call from the regulators to save Credit Suisse. They kind of had an inkling that this might happen. But on Wednesday, when the credit line was given, they didn’t know anything about it yet.

The first Colm Kelleher ever found out about it was at 4pm on Thursday, the following day, when he was instructed that the government and regulators and central bank wanted UBS to come up with a plan for Credit Suisse. And that’s really when everything started to accelerate.

Michela Tindera

OK, but does UBS even want this deal? Do they have any say in this?

Stephen Morris

UBS has been steadfast in its position that it does not want to merge with Credit Suisse. It has its own plan. It’s doing quite well. And they don’t want any part of what they think is a quite rancid culture over at Credit Suisse. But ultimately, when your government comes to you and says, we want you to do this, you have limited room for manoeuvre. So UBS sets about trying to get itself the best deal it can and the deal that protects it and its shareholders from any of the toxicity that might come across from Credit Suisse as part of it.

Michela Tindera

So the banks both hire advisers to help them get a good deal. But keep in mind that they’re trying to keep things quiet. And that means code names.

Stephen Morris

So UBS, they came up with two code names based around trees. Credit Suisse was Cedar, and UBS was Ulmus, which is the Latin word for an elm tree. And on the other side, Credit Suisse came up with lake-based monikers for each part of the deal. Credit Suisse called itself Como after Lake Como, and UBS was Geneva after the, obviously the lake in Switzerland. Obviously, this didn’t do much for keeping the deal secret because the Financial Times managed to find out about most of it as it was happening.

Michela Tindera

So by Friday morning . . .

Stephen Morris

Both sides are working with their code names on the different facets of the deal. UBS isn’t really talking to Credit Suisse. As far as it’s concerned, it’s negotiating with the government and the central bank and the regulators. It’s not interested in talking to executives at Credit Suisse that have lost control of their own destiny at this point. They have no power. This is incredibly frustrating for Credit Suisse, of course, because as far as they’re concerned, a few days ago, they were executives in charge of one of the world’s largest and most prestigious banks.

Michela Tindera

Now, the deadline for this merger is a mere two days away. And UBS is trying to squeeze all it can from this deal.

Stephen Morris

UBS is gonna wanna pay the least it possibly can for its rival, and it’s gonna want to secure the maximum amount of government support, both in terms of liquidity lines, but also guarantees and indemnities for what they might find at Credit Suisse because, remember, 72 hours is not a long time to look at a massive global financial institution and conclude what it’s worth and if there are any unexploded bombs there on the balance sheet, which could come back to haunt them. And we’ve seen this in financial crises in the past. And they also want the government to help cover some of the potential losses because winding down big banks like this is very expensive. You have to decommission IT systems, you have to compensate clients, you have to pay off staff with redundancy when you fire them. So it’s locked in negotiations with the government saying, OK, we’re the only option to save Credit Suisse, this is what we need to do it.

Michela Tindera

The FT also finds out that asset management firm BlackRock is considering ways to carve up Credit Suisse. But almost as soon as BlackRock’s planes touch down in Zurich . . .

Stephen Morris

BlackRock gets a pretty severe message from the Swiss establishment saying: we want a Swiss solution to this. We do not want a foreign firm coming in and carving up one of our national icons. So thank you very much for your interest, but we will be sorting this out ourselves. So BlackRock, pack up and fly out.

Michela Tindera

While this is happening on Friday, Stephen and some of our colleagues have been keeping tabs with their sources.

Stephen Morris

I think it was around 9.15pm, we put out a story saying UBS is in talks to take over the whole of Credit Suisse. This isn’t just one or two units. This isn’t a partnership. This is a full-scale takeover. The world has suspected that this is happening, but it’s the first time anyone’s confirmed this. And obviously the two banks retreat further into their war rooms and work all night on this.

Michela Tindera

Which brings us to Saturday. Less than 48 hours until markets in Asia open and still, there’s no deal.

Stephen Morris

UBS still really isn’t talking to Credit Suisse.

Michela Tindera

And on top of this, the Swiss government is feeling pressure from around the world.

Stephen Morris

When a global financial institution gets into stress, there are a lot of other parties that are interested as well. Credit Suisse has big operations in New York and around the US, in London, in Singapore, and everybody around the world wants to make sure that their little part of the bank is protected if there is a bankruptcy. Janet Yellen over in the US, Sam Woods, Andrew Bailey at the Bank of England, Andrea Enria at the European Central Bank — they do not want a bank to collapse. In fact, one of our sources described them as kicking the shit out of the Swiss to act as quickly as they could because it was gonna become much bigger than one bank in Switzerland very quickly if there was a failure, because as we know, fear or lack of confidence spreads very quickly in financial markets and it could have caused — the word is contagion — it could have caused a much, much larger crisis dragging down several other weaker banks in the US and around Europe.

Michela Tindera

So the Swiss government knows what they have to do. But Stephen says they have another obstacle to clear.

Stephen Morris

We’ve also found out that the Swiss government is planning to pass legislation to essentially sidestep the normal six-week consultation period and vote for shareholders of both companies. They need to get this done by the end of the weekend and they can’t risk shareholders not voting for it. So they’re actually changing the laws of the whole country to allow them to force through this deal without a proper shareholder vote. And that was and is very controversial.

Michela Tindera

So UBS is still deliberating on a deal, but without really talking to Credit Suisse. BlackRock has come and gone. Officials in other countries are throwing in their two cents. And the Swiss government is even trying to change its laws to meet this Sunday deadline. But at this point, with only hours left, an offer price hasn’t even been mentioned.

Stephen Morris

The first time a price is actually mentioned, Colm Kelleher comes out of a dinner in Zurich on Saturday night and he calls his counterpart at Credit Suisse to inform him that UBS was gonna offer $1bn in total in stock for the whole group.

Michela Tindera

That offer would have meant that one Credit Suisse share was worth about SFr0.25. Now, keep in mind that even after the rocky week that the bank had just gone through, its share price was SFr1.86 when the markets closed. So this is a low offer, to say the least.

Stephen Morris

Credit Suisse is obviously outraged by this, both in terms of the financial terms, but also it’s kind of an insult as well. Initially, UBS says that’s our offer, take it or leave it.

Michela Tindera

Sunday morning, Stephen and our colleagues published a story that reveals UBS’s $1bn offer.

What was the reaction at the time when that story came out?

Stephen Morris

Well, the reaction first was disbelief at the low level of the price, especially with the government changing the laws of the country at the same time giving UBS all this kind of indemnity. So we’re wondering at this point if this gets done. I mean, is this just too punchy an offer from UBS to ever be accepted? And are we starting to think about a nationalisation of Credit Suisse instead? We subsequently learned that was never on the cards.

Michela Tindera

But essentially, after this $1bn offer comes out, the Swiss central bank, the national regulator Finma and the Swiss finance minister call Credit Suisse and say . . .

Stephen Morris

You will sign this deal or we will remove you (chuckle) because we’ve already changed the law of the country. We will remove you as board members, install people that will sign off the deal and you will kind of be a national disgrace. It then goes back to UBS and says, OK, we know that you’re not in trouble. We know that you don’t want this, but you can’t offer 1bn. That’s just too low.

Michela Tindera

So UBS doubles their offer to 2bn, and that’s still too low for Credit Suisse to accept. And again, the clock is ticking. But going into Sunday evening . . .

[AUDIO CLIP OF A CLOCK TIMER TICKING AND DINGING]

Stephen Morris

We hear that this is signed. This is now a done deal. The price has been increased to $3.25bn, about SFr3bn. Essentially, UBS is taking over the whole thing. They’re just gonna swallow the whole thing and sort it out over the next few years.

Michela Tindera

Sunday night, there’s a press conference in Bern, Switzerland. The chairs of UBS and Credit Suisse, the country’s finance minister and other regulators attend, and together they announce the deal.

Here’s UBS chair Colm Kelleher:

Colm Kelleher

This transaction supports financial stability in Switzerland and creates significant sustainable value for UBS shareholders. Combining the best of Credit Suisse with our strategy and culture will help these businesses flourish. I am pleased that this transaction will bring the long desired stability for the Credit Suisse client base.

Stephen Morris

The chairman of UBS is very blunt and says there’s no two ways about it — this is a rescue of Credit Suisse.

Michela Tindera

And this is what Swiss finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter has to say.

Karin Keller-Sutter

I have to say that very clearly, this is no bailout. This is a commercial solution.

Stephen Morris

The Swiss are very preoccupied with telling everyone this is not a bailout. This is a commercial deal that has been worked out between two companies in the private sector. Because remember, memories of the 2008 government bailout of UBS are still very fresh among the populace. But I would say the overriding emotion at that press conference is just relief at this point, because I’ve said before, if a big bank like that goes down, both in terms of real financial terms but also confidence in the markets would have been shattered and Monday morning could have been carnage. And remember, on the other side of the Atlantic, there are two more US banks potentially going bankrupt and trying to be rescued by their larger peers. So this is not, this is not happening in a vacuum. This is happening in the context of a lot of global panic about the stability of various banking systems in different countries.

Michela Tindera

So on Monday, when markets open . . .

News clip

It has been a day of volatility on the global markets following that unprecedented historic banking deal. Now, there were sharp losses in early trading in Asia and Europe, although banking stocks have since rebounded.

News clip

UBS stocks fell by up to 13 per cent earlier in the day, but they have rallied and they were up by 1.3 per cent at the time of closing.

Stephen Morris

Basically, there isn’t this huge ripple effect through financial markets. The last-ditch intervention by the Swiss has actually worked. Credit Suisse isn’t gonna go bankrupt. The clients aren’t gonna lose all of their money. Taxpayers don’t have to contribute. And the global investment banking system isn’t gonna have this big contagion effect through. So actually, it was much better than I personally was thinking. I was bracing for another 24-hour day.

Michela Tindera

So, Stephen, now that the dust is settled a little bit, where does this leave UBS?

Stephen Morris

It’s kind of strange, you know, because Credit Suisse both does and doesn’t exist. UBS does not own it yet. It’ll take, I think, between two to four months to fully clear everything and for them to take control. And because when you have 72 but really in 48 hours to make a decision about something, you haven’t decided. So I don’t think UBS knows what it’s gonna do with the Credit Suisse brand. Will it retire it completely in disgrace? Or will it try and revive it in some way? I don’t think it knows what it’s gonna do. I mean, there’s still a lot of stuff for them to kind of work through in the coming weeks.

Michela Tindera

And what about Credit Suisse?

Stephen Morris

Credit Suisse sent a memo to staff saying, you have to come into the office and we will continue to pay you. The Swiss government then did pass legislation saying no more bonuses for Credit Suisse, which I think was unavoidable in the context of the public anger. There have been protests outside Credit Suisse’s office in the centre of Zurich, for example. So it’s in a limbo at the moment. But, you know, as of today, I imagine Axel Lehmann is, you know, sat and probably quite sad in his office on Paradeplatz Square and as is the CEO Ulrich Körner who didn’t even get to be a year in charge before his bank collapsed, and presumably he’ll lose his job.

Michela Tindera

What do you think this means for the banking industry at large now that these two banks have merged?

Stephen Morris

We don’t know yet. But when you have a big deal like this, that does change the European and global banking landscape. It’s almost like a domino. It can set off an effect where other banks will say, oh, well, a large deal like that is actually possible and can be very advantageous for whoever the buyer is. Maybe we should dust off some of our domestic and cross-border acquisition plans and have a look at them again because they might actually work.

It also changes the competitive landscape. You’re now looking at a much larger bank, especially when all the problems have been sorted out in a couple of years that will be better able to compete and take market share from its rivals. So I’m sure the management teams of their rivals will be looking at what maybe they can do to get bigger in one sort of, as they say, inorganically, not just growing cells, but by buying something else. But that all very much remains to be seen. I mean, Switzerland is a unique country for many reasons, and its banking system is not part of the EU. It’s very different to the UK as well. So it may be that this is just an idiosyncratic rescue of a good bank of a very, very bad one. But certainly it does change the landscape. And we’re gonna have a lot of interesting situations, I think, to cover over the next two to three years.

Emotions in the National Council ran high during the evening, with a clear majority voting against the government's motions.

The National Council's rebuff of the federal government's guarantees of 109 billion Swiss francs for the merger of UBS and Credit Suisse mainly resulted in prolonging the debate, at least for the time being. Now the reconciliation process begins to amend the bill so it is palatable for both chambers and can be submitted for approval. If the process is unsuccessful, the bill will fail.

Still, a rejection of the bill wouldn't have any consequences for the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, because the commitments made by the federal government through emergency legislation are legally binding.

Opposition from the Wings

The rejection in the National Council was a foregone conclusion. The SVP, SP, and the Greens had already spoken out against the motion in advance, each setting their conditions to be met for approval.

Some of the demands were formulated in review motions. These included a review of the Banking Act, an examination of the possible culpability of former and active managers of Credit Suisse, and an investigation into the practical applicability, effectiveness, and meaningfulness of the too-big-to-fail rules. The conservative SVP pushed through a demand for measures to ensure competition despite the merger, although motions calling for a discussion on binding proposals did not pass.

A Clear Rejection

The results came shortly before midnight when the vote for supplementary credit was rejected by a vote of 102 votes to 71 with 2 abstentions. The framework conditions for the use of the funds were also rejected by a similar ratio of votes.

In the afternoon session, the Council of States approved both the credits and the framework conditions.

UBS Group AG draws attention from hedge funds and institutional investors

UBS Group AG (UBS) has recently drawn attention from hedge funds and institutional investors, with Mirabella Financial Services LLP purchasing a new position worth around $30,000, Hexagon Capital Partners LLC boosting its position by 151% and purchasing 2,106 shares in UBS. Penserra Capital Management LLC also bought a new position for $35,000 while Guardian Wealth Advisors LLC snapped up a new batch of shares in UBS for approximately $37,000. Finally, Bessemer Group Inc. raised its stake in the bank’s stock by 66.6%, buying an additional 1,381 shares totalling at $50,000. Hedge funds and other institutional investors own almost one third of the company’s stock.

UBS Group AG is a holding company that provides financial management services across various sectors including Global Wealth Management, Personal and Corporate Banking, Asset Management, Investment Bank, and Group Functions. Recently it announced an annual dividend to be paid on April 14th. The yield on this dividend payout is 0.83%, with shareholders set to receive a total of $0.179 per share subject to the ex-dividend date on April 12th.

Several research analysts have issued reports on UBS recently; Societe Generale downgraded the bank’s rating from “buy” to “hold” with the assigned target price being $18.86; Royal Bank of Canada lowered shares from “outperform” to “sector perform”; StockNews.com downgraded shares from a “buy rating” to “hold”; and finally TheStreet lowered their rating from “b-” to “c”. According to Bloomberg, UBS has an average rating of “Hold” with an average consensus target price of $19.38 as at April 11th.

Shares of UBS opened at $20.70 on Tuesday reflecting its current market cap which sits neatly at just over $72 billion. The company’s 52-week high was set at $22.30, while its 52-week low stood at $13.80 with a quick and current ratio of 1.00 each and debt-to-equity in excess of 3.29. UBS operates under a beta of 1.10 with a price to earnings ratio of 9.24.

Though the rating for UBS has taken a bit of a negative hit as explained, it is still able to attract high level institutional investors and hedge funds in spite of the declining ratings by some analysts; it continues to offer financial management services across multiple sectors, presenting itself as an attractive investment opportunity for many savvy investors who remain confident in the bank’s ability to create value for clients and shareholders alike over the long term.","['Ronald Kaufman', 'Ronald Kaufman Is A Veteran Analyst', 'Researcher With An Expertise In The Fields Of Pharma', 'Cyber', 'Foodtech', 'Blockchain.

Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS, has agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.24bn), officials from the banks have said, in a deal designed to contain a widening crisis of confidence in global finance.

The agreement, announced late on Sunday, includes 100 billion francs ($108bn) in liquidity assistance for UBS and Credit Suisse from the Swiss central bank.

“With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,” the Swiss central bank said.

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) said that there was a risk that Credit Suisse could have become “illiquid, even if it remained solvent, and it was necessary for the authorities to take action”.

To enable UBS to take over Credit Suisse, the federal government is providing a loss guarantee of a maximum of 9 billion francs ($9.7bn) for a clearly defined part of the portfolio, the government said.

This will be activated if losses are actually incurred on this portfolio. In that eventuality, UBS would assume the first 5 billion francs ($5.4bn), the federal government the next 9 billion francs ($9.7bn), and UBS would assume any further losses, the government said.

Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old bank, has been the biggest name ensnared in market turmoil unleashed by the recent collapse of United States lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, forcing it to tap $54bn in central bank funding last week.

Authorities had been scrambling to rescue Credit Suisse, among the world’s largest wealth managers, before financial markets reopened on Monday.

FINMA, which said it had approved the takeover, said recent measures to stabilise itself were “not enough to restore confidence in the bank, however, and more far-reaching options were also examined”.

UBS and Credit Suisse are both in a group of the 30 global systemically important banks watched closely by regulators, and Credit Suisse’s failure would ripple throughout the entire financial system.

The announcement came in a make-or-break weekend after some rivals grew cautious in their dealings with the struggling Swiss lender, and its regulators urged it to pursue a deal with UBS.

The two banks’ fortunes have diverged sharply over the past year. UBS earned $7.6bn in profit in 2022, while Credit Suisse lost $7.9bn. Credit Suisse’s shares are down 74 percent from a year ago, while UBS’s are relatively flat.",[],2023-03-19 00:00:00
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/banking-giant-ubs-announces-acquisition-of-credit-suisse-amid-financial-turmoil,Banking giant UBS announces acquisition of Credit Suisse amid financial turmoil,"BERN, Switzerland (AP) — Banking giant UBS is buying its smaller rival Credit Suisse in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in global banking, Swiss President Alain Berset announced on Sunday night.

Swiss president Alain Berset, who did not specify a value of the deal, called the announcement “one of great breadth for the stability of international finance. An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.”

Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s globally systemic important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

Sunday’s news conference follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further bank panics. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse’s share price began plummeting this week.

The 167-year-old Credit Suisse already received a $50 billion (54 million Swiss francs) loan from the Swiss National Bank, which briefly caused a rally in the bank’s stock price. Yet the move did not appear to be enough to stem an outflow of deposits, according to news reports.

Still, many of Credit Suisse’s problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.

The deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn’t invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10 percent.

On Friday, shares dropped 8 percent to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.

Its current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.

While smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.

Despite the banking turmoil, the European Central Bank on Thursday approved a large, half-percentage point increase in interest rates to try to curb stubbornly high inflation, saying Europe’s banking sector is “resilient,” with strong finances.

ECB President Christine Lagarde said the banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.

The Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.","['Jamey Keaten', 'Associated Press', 'Ken Sweet']",2023-03-19 15:11:27-04:00

In order to subside these concerns, UBS is offering to buy back bonds worth €2.75 billion issued on March 17.

The concerned bonds include €1.5 billion 4.625% fixed rate notes due March 2028 and €1.25 billion 4.750% fixed rate notes due March 2032. The company has offered to buy these bonds for cash at their respective re-offer price.

With the bond buyback, UBS aims to boost investors’ confidence in the stock.

Is UBS a Good Buy?

UBS stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on nine Buys, two Holds, and two Sells. The average price target of $25.29 implies 20.1% upside potential. Shares of the company have gained 14.5% over the past three months.

Switzerland's parliament rejected on Wednesday the government's 109 billion Swiss francs ($120.82 billion) aid for Credit Suisse's merger with UBS, leaving the fallen bank's hastily arranged rescue without a largely symbolic parliamentary blessing.

While the upper house had approved the government's contribution to the rescue package, parliament's lower, and larger chamber, pushed back again on Wednesday.

It had already rejected the proposals in a late night session on Tuesday, forcing the upper house to find a solution when it met again on Wednesday.

Seeking a compromise, the upper house passed changes to the measure on Wednesday morning, but it was not enough to sway the lower house lawmakers.

They turned it down by 103 votes to 71 in favour, a similar level of opposition to the night before.

Speaking just before the lower house vote, Cedric Wermuth, the co-president of the Social Democrats said the party just could not support the funding.

While the government's commitment, made using emergency law, cannot be overturned, the vote marks a symbolic rebuke for the authorities, whose decision to largely bypass the nation's legislative has angered many politicians.

""This decision has no impact on the takeover of Credit Suisse decided on March 19,"" the Swiss Finance Ministry said after the vote.

The support package had already been given binding approval by the parliament's finance delegation, due to the urgency of the matter, it said.

""The funds have already been fully committed,"" it added.

Lawmakers who backed an approval of the deal, voiced concern about Switzerland's image.

""It doesn't really matter what we decide in detail, but it would really send a bad signal if these loans were rejected,"" said Eva Herzog, who is a member of the Council of States, the upper house, before the vote.

Following a day of heated debates held in the country's four national languages, that continued into early morning hours, the upper house passed changes aimed at winning over the sceptics.

They included a proposal for Switzerland's federal government to draft an amendment to the country's Banking Act. Its aim would be to reduce the risks posed by systemically relevant banks, such as Credit Suisse and UBS for Switzerland, by, for example, raising capital requirements and restricting bonuses.

Addressing parliament before the vote on Wednesday, finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter told lawmakers to consider what message their rejection of the rescue would send to the world.

""What signal do you want to give internationally, are the institutions reliable, do you value financial market stability in a place where you already have a financial centre with a certain importance?""

Lawmakers were recalled to the country's capital, Bern, for the rare extraordinary session to discuss the Swiss government's open chequebook response to a collapse that many in the country have blamed on Credit Suisse's top management.

Last month's shotgun marriage which saw the bank taken over by rival UBS for 3 billion Swiss francs and propped up with more than 250 billion Swiss francs in guarantees and support has drawn widespread criticism.

The government invoked Swiss emergency law to sign it off to the ire of the almost 250 lawmakers left without a say.

""The use of emergency law has reached a level in the last three years that is beginning to annoy me,"" Hansjoerg Knecht, a member of Parliament's upper house, said on Tuesday.

This comes after UBS agreed to buy rival Credit Suisse for $3.23 billion in stock last month, and assume up to $5.4 billion in losses.

According to a report in Bloomberg, the global head of wealth management at UBS, Iqbal Khan, met with Credit Suisse executives including the local lender’s wealth head Puneet Matta in Singapore. Khan then reportedly told the Credit Suisse staff that the wealth business in India is likely to be retained.

Khan was in Credit Suisse before he left for UBS in 2019. UBS had left India by 2014, exiting the country’s private-wealth market. The return is expected to pave the way for UBS into the market as the number of billionaires in India continues to rise.

As per the report, the merger would see large parts of Credit Suisse’s investment bank wind down. The lender has just over 40 wealth management employees and around 7,000 overall employees in the country.

The deal inked between UBS and Credit Suisse last month includes $108 billion in liquidity assistance for UBS and Credit Suisse from the Swiss central bank. The federal government is providing a loss guarantee of a maximum 9 billion Swiss francs to enable UBS take over Credit Suisse.

This will be activated if losses are actually incurred on this portfolio. In that eventuality, UBS would assume the first 5 billion francs, the federal government the next 9 billion francs, and UBS would assume any further losses, the government said.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-ubs-boomerang-ceo-could-start-integrating-rival-credit-suisse-135841842.html,How UBS's boomerang CEO could start integrating rival Credit Suisse and calm investors,"UBS's (UBS) boomerang CEO, Sergio Ermotti, is likely to take a careful yet strategic approach to the integration of Credit Suisse amid rattled UBS shareholders and an indignant Swiss public.

In what insiders tell Yahoo Finance was a surprise decision, UBS decided Wednesday to bring back Ermotti as CEO. He rejoins the bank on April 5, replacing Ralph Hamers, who has been on the job for only about two years and played a key role in purchasing stricken rival Credit Suisse earlier this month.

The Swiss-born Ermotti (Hamers comes from the Netherlands) led UBS successfully for nine years until 2020 and is credited with shrinking the company's investment bank to reduce risk, as well as an expansion of its wealth-management franchise.

""Sergio is the right man at the right time for the job,"" a person familiar with UBS's thinking and Ermotti tells Yahoo Finance. ""He is an investment banker first, and that will be very helpful in winding down Credit Suisse's investment bank and integrating other areas.""

After much speculation and concern about a banking crisis, UBS made its play for Credit Suisse earlier this month for a total purchase price of $3.2 billion.

UBS sees the deal contributing to earnings growth by 2027. The Credit Suisse investment bank is expected to be wound down. The bank sees annualized cost savings of $8 billion by 2027 — mostly through layoffs. And both banks have unrestricted access to the Swiss National Bank's existing facilities.

The integration is expected to take three to four years.

UBS shares are up roughly 6% since the deal was announced on March 19.

The source adds that Ermotti — known to go deep on execution and stay close to key personnel — is likely to focus in his first 90 days back on understanding the risks and exposures of the Credit Suisse investment banking business.

Another area of Ermotti's early attention is likely to be the retention of important Credit Suisse employees in wealth management and investment banking.

""If he sees key personnel being poached, he will make the case to that person to stay,"" the source said.

Further, as a Swiss citizen, Ermotti may be more sympathetic to a layoff timeline and how the Swiss public is feeling on the deal and can uniquely and effectively communicate that, the source noted.

Over time, 20,000 to 25,000 jobs from Credit Suisse may be cut, the source estimated. The company has more than 50,000 employees.

Wall Street appears to be positive on Ermotti's return, with UBS shares up over 3.5% in early trading.

""UBS's priorities have clearly changed, with the integration of CS being the most important task. In addition, UBS is already facing significant political pressure due to its large size and importance for the country. The question 'what to do with CS Switzerland?' has already triggered a heated debate. We welcome the appointment of Sergio Ermotti and believe that he is right person for the challenging task, given his experience of successfully transforming UBS after the Global Financial Crisis,"" Andreas Venditti said in a client note.

""It's a historic day, and a day we hoped would not come,"" UBS chair Colm Kelleher said on a call Sunday night that included UBS CEO Hamers. No Credit Suisse executives or board members were on the call.

UBS execs said they would move ""fast"" to wind down Credit Suisse's investment bank. The company also said it had taken reserves against Credit Suisse's high-profile litigation matters.

Credit Suisse stock fell more than 52% on Monday while UBS shed around 3%.

Here's what Wall Street is saying early on about the deal.

Vontobel's Andreas Venditti: ""Thanks to the transaction, a collapse of CS has been avoided. This would have had massive consequences for the Swiss economy, the Swiss financial center, and UBS as well. UBS pays CHF 3 bn for a business that was valued multiples of that just a few weeks ago. In addition, it has secured important loss protections. However, there are many uncertainties and significant risks. The UBS investment case changes substantially. The issues currently impacting the global banking sector are not over.""

Goldman Sachs' Lotfi Karoui: ""For credit markets, the read-through is twofold: In both the USD and EUR markets, the excess premium that investors had been demanding to hold European bank credit risk now has room to compress. On Friday, we argued that the performance of the broader European banking sector would remain pressured until clarity is provided on Credit Suisse’s future path and recommended moving to a neutral allocation on banks in the EUR market (from overweight previously). Today’s outcome provides such clarity. In particular, the liquidity and loss guarantees provided by the SNB and the Swiss government are likely to act as dampeners for tail risk and help close the recent valuation gap between European banks and non-financials. As such, we don’t think a neutral allocation is warranted and are shifting back to an overweight allocation. Of course, we are mindful that the situation among US regional banks remains fluid. But as we discussed on Friday, we take comfort from the limited contagion from US regional banks to larger money center banks, a trend we expect will persist. We reiterate our overweight allocation on US money center banks in the USD market.""

Evercore ISI's Krishna Guha: ""The agreement – which should achieve its goal of stabilizing CS – is strongly positive for stability and global markets relative to a no-deal scenario. But the decision to completely write down CHF 15.8bn in CS AT1 debt – which we warned last week could be at risk to enable SNB funding on the scale required – risks spreading contagion through the European banking system via repricing of bail-in debt and equity at other banks. The outcome for equity-holders may also worry investors in other weak banks, particularly but not only in Europe. If this makes it harder to raise equity capital it could have downsides for stability. The CS drama now shifts from negotiation risk to execution risk, which the Swiss authorities are moving aggressively to manage down, but is not zero. Market focus will likely broaden out to other weaker European banks as well as US regional banks.""

Wedbush's Dan Ives: ""With this game of musical chairs happening on the banking sector and nervousness across the financials with the Credit Suisse fire sale to UBS announced over the weekend, we continue to strongly believe the tech trade will be viewed more as the safety trade on the Street looking ahead. So far in 2023 despite all the skeptics and many yelling fire in a crowded theater on the tech sector, NASDAQ is up roughly 13% this year with over the last few weeks more investors quickly moving to large cap tech stocks in a jittery financial backdrop with the SVB black eye moment followed by the CS arranged marriage announced this weekend.""

22V Research's Jacob Funk Kirkegaard: ""Overall, my view is per my note on the ECB decision last week that European banks are well capitalized, have good liquidity (thanks ECB TLTROs) and given the design of the euro area with spreads and volatility in risk free rates will generally tend to hedge interest rate risk much more than US banks do. As such, I do not believe this is the beginning of a new European banking crisis, as at least maturity mismatches and interest rate risks are among those issues with generally a lot of focus (and hedges) and therefore relatively less risk (despite the ECB’s rapid hikes) than apparently among US regional banks. Some repricing of AT1 assets in the EU is plausible, given that investors will now be looking at whether individual banks have “similar footnotes” as CS, but given the strong response from the ECB, this will be isolated events.""

BMO Capital Markets' James Fotheringham: ""U.S. investment banks are waking up to one less global competitor, as UBS management committed to down-sizing CS's trading and investment banking operations; GS, MS, JPM and others should benefit from market share development to offset otherwise-languishing global CIB revenues.""

The historic deal comes as major financial institutions continue to grapple with the fallout from the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this month, and work to stave off a broader crisis.

""This takeover was made possible with the support of the Swiss federal government, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA and the Swiss National Bank,"" the Swiss National Bank said in a statement. ""With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation.""

UBS will buy Credit Suisse for more than $3 billion, Credit Suisse said in a news release detailing the purchase, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. All of the bank's current shareholders will receive one share of UBS for around 22 1/2 shares of Credit Suisse, according to the release.

In a statement, Axel P. Lehmann, the chairman of Credit Suisse's board of directors, said ""the announced merger represents the best available outcome,"" citing ""recent extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances.""

""This has been an extremely challenging time for Credit Suisse and while the team has worked tirelessly to address many significant legacy issues and execute on its new strategy, we are forced to reach a solution today that provides a durable outcome,"" Lehmann's added.

At a news conference held Sunday afternoon to discuss the emergency purchase, Karin Keller-Sutter, president of FINMA, said ""Switzerland has to take responsibilities beyond its own borders,"" and added that the deal was reached in an effort to avoid ""irreparable economic turmoil in Switzerland and throughout the world."" Keller-Sutter said the purchase ""laid the foundations for greater stability both in Switzerland and internationally.""

Fears about the stability of the global banking system spread across the U.S. and Europe in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank's failures, which happened less than two weeks ago ago and within days of each other. Their closures prompted rare moves by the federal government as well as some of the largest U.S. banks to shore up finances at institutions that became threatened in the turmoil.

Credit Suisse received almost $54 billion last week from the Swiss national bank as part of those negotiations, while a consortium of 11 massive U.S. banks, including Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, agreed to provide $30 billion in funding for First Republic Bank. Those four banks each agreed to contribute $5 billion, while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley each agreed to give $2.5 billion and BNY Mellon, PNC Bank, State Street, Truist and U.S. Bank each agreed to give $1 billion.

The pledges of emergency funding on Thursday briefly interrupted what had been ongoing downturns in both banks' stocks, which resumed the following day. On Friday, Credit Suisse's share price slipped 7% and ended the day at $2.01.

For Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second-largest commercial bank, shares dropped 30% on the SIX stock exchange after its largest shareholder said it would not put any more money into the institution. The bank had faced problems before the U.S. banks' failures gave rise to fear and a lack of confidence among big investors, and it announced its plans to borrow up to 50 billion francs from the national bank on Thursday.

""This additional liquidity would support Credit Suisse's core businesses and clients as Credit Suisse takes the necessary steps to create a simpler and more focused bank built around client needs,"" said Credit Suisse in a statement at the time.

The steep drop-off in its share prices one day earlier marked a record-low for Credit Suisse, after the Saudi National Bank told news outlets that it would not inject additional funds into the institution as it sought to avoid regulations that would become applicable with a stake in the Swiss lender above 10%. That upheaval caused an automatic freeze in trading of shares of Credit Suisse on the Swiss market and significantly impacted shares of other large European banks, with some share prices falling by double-digits.

Despite the Swiss national bank's move to shore up finances at Credit Suisse, analysts at Capital Economics said concerns remained about the health of the institution, especially since it has not been profitable in two years.

Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in an investor note on Friday that, while Credit Suisse has a plan to restore business over the course of three years, ""it is uncertain whether markets will give it that long.""",['Emily Mae Czachor'],

March 21 (Reuters) - UBS (UBSG.S) is set to enter talks with Michael Klein to terminate a deal that would have seen the Wall Street dealmaker take control of much of Credit Suisse's (CSGN.S) investment bank, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.

UBS on Sunday agreed to buy rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.23 billion) in stock and agreed to assume up to 5 billion francs ($5.4 billion) in losses, in a shotgun merger engineered by Swiss authorities to avoid more market-shaking turmoil in global banking.

Klein, a veteran dealmaker, was merging his eponymous advisory boutique into Credit Suisse's investment banking operations to create CS First Boston as a standalone business which he would have led from New York.

UBS has now assigned a legal team to examine how to void the contract Credit Suisse signed with Klein in the cheapest way possible, according to the FT report, which cited people with direct knowledge of the matter.

""We assume he (Klein) is cherry picking. The deal was done when the selling bank had a gun held to its head and we are no longer in that position,"" a person close to UBS said, according to the report.

UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment, while Klein could not be immediately reached for comment.

https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/shocked-credit-suisse-staff-fear-uncertain-future-despite-ubs-rescue-deal-2023-03-20/,Stunned Credit Suisse staff fear uncertain future despite UBS rescue deal,"













SINGAPORE/HONG KONG, March 20 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse staff arriving to work in Asian financial centres on Monday morning fretted about retrenchments and retaining business after larger Swiss rival UBS agreed to swallow the 167-year-old bank in a state-backed rescue.

""I don't know if I get to stay, leave, or should I consider my options now?"" said one Southeast Asia-based banker, who like other staff spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.

The banker also complained of pressure from clients to provide answers within 24 hours to questions about the UBS deal.

Late on Sunday, Swiss authorities capped a tense week of markets by engineering a 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.24 billion)takeover of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) by UBS (UBSG.S), supported by billions in state funding, while angering holders of risky bonds by writing down their debt to zero.

Credit Suisse employs 50,000 people globally across wealth management, investment banking and asset management operations, with more than 150 offices in 50 countries.

Credit Suisse had been steadily losing wealth management market share to UBS and to more well-capitalised U.S. banks in investment banking in the last few years, but remained the second-biggest wealth manager in Asia, behind only its acquirer.

""It's an extremely sad day to see us ending our legacy this way,"" said one Singapore-based senior employee in Credit Suisse's wealth management unit.

The bank told staff its wealth assets are operationally separate from UBS for now, but once they merged, clients might want to consider moving some assets to another bank if concentration was a concern, according to an internal memo.

Credit Suisse said it would still press ahead with its annual investment conference that kicks off in Hong Kong on Tuesday, although media are no longer invited.

""I have no idea what it means to still continue 'business as usual' when we're not even sure our job is going to be there,"" said one Hong-Kong-based employee.

As a giant wall backdrop as high as the ceiling with ""Credit Suisse AIC"" emblazed on it glowed in a hotel lobby, the bank said its chairman and CEO would not turn up at the event.

Credit Suisse shares plunged 60% in early trade on Monday, while UBS lost 15%, as early investor optimism about official efforts to stem a banking crisis quickly evaporated.

Outside its office near Singapore's central business district, nearby coffee shops, usually bustling with bankers from Credit Suisse and rivals, were less crowded early on Monday.

Some of the bank's employees brushed aside questions from Reuters journalists waiting outside the office lobby.

UBS warned on Sunday that it would pare back much of Credit Suisse's investment bank, which Credit Suisse had planned to spin off.

The Swiss Bank Employees Association on Monday called on UBS to keep job cuts to an ""absolute minimum"".

UBS and Credit Suisse sources said Southeast Asia was among the regions where the banks had the most overlap on the wealth management and investment banking teams.

""Investment banking stands out and that could be where the pain is felt most for Credit Suisse,"" a senior executive at UBS said.

Credit Suisse is ranked 20th on the league tables for equity capital markets for the first quarter in Asia Pacific including Japan, according to data from Refinitiv, with a 1.1% market share.

Still, it remains a powerful equity capital markets entity in Southeast Asia's growing markets and shares the second spot with a 9.3% market share, up from 3.2% a year earlier.

Ivo Roos is stepping down as CEO of Valterna after ten years at his request. He remains with the firm and will fully devote himself to serving his clients, according to a statement Wednesday.

René Brunner becomes the new CEO on July 1, having learned the investment advisory and asset management trade from scratch and gained 35 years of professional experience, according to Valterna, which previously was Asset Management Partners. Roles include various specialist and management positions at Credit Suisse and UBS. Brunner spent the past twelve years at UBS as head of wealth management for the Lucerne region.

In March, the firm changed its name from Asset Management Partners to Valterna, a combination of the words «value» and «alternative» which it says represents the elementary values of the firm. It seeks to create value by offering alternative and private market investments.

An Ideal Successor

With him, they have found the ideal successor for Roos and he will be a great reinforcement for the company. «René Brunner is ideally qualified for this position, has a very high customer focus, and has an extensive network in our core business,» says Valterna chairman Hugo Schuermann.

Although Roos (pictured below) is relinquishing operational management, he will continue to play a key role in shaping Valterna's fortunes as a member of the board of directors. Since a management buyout in 2013, he has «very successfully developed Valterna into a leading financial boutique in central Switzerland,» according to the statement.

https://www.ubs.com/us/en/wealth-management/insights/market-news/article.1587949.html,US equity sectors: Getting more defensive in our sector positioning,"The combination of still-high inflation, a very inverted yield curve, and tightening bank lending standards (which will likely only get worse due to the turmoil in the banking sector) suggests increased risks of difficult economic conditions later this year.

CIO six-month tactical view

This month, we become more defensive in our sector positioning based on indications that the economy is facing challenges ahead. The yield curve is heavily inverted (although less so over the last week), banks are tightening lending standards (and will likely only get incrementally tighter due to the recent turmoil in the banking sector), and inflation remains too high. Taken together, these are conditions that suggest investors should expect continued headwinds that will cap equity market upside and present downside risks in the months ahead. But the headwinds may not exert more sustained downward pressure on corporate profits and equity markets until later this year, and quite possibly late in the year, especially considering that consumers are still sitting on about USD 1 trillion of excess savings accumulated during the pandemic.



We upgrade communication services, industrials, and utilities. We downgrade consumer discretionary, energy, and real estate. Our most preferred sectors are now consumer staples, industrials, and utilities. Our least preferred sectors are consumer discretionary, financials, and information technology.



Most preferred

Consumer staples: We think earnings for this defensive sector should hold up better than the market as economic growth slows. In addition, we expect further declines in the ISM Manufacturing index, which typically drives outperformance for this sector. Relative valuations are back near historical averages which makes them attractive, in our view, given the sector's defensive growth profile in a potentially challenging macro environment.



Industrials (upgrade from neutral): The sector's exposure to a few secular growth drivers is attractive, in our view. Defense companies should benefit from higher defense budgets in the years ahead, although we acknowledge near-term uncertainty about defense spending heading into the debt ceiling negotiations. In addition, the infrastructure law should support nonresidential construction, while aerospace manufacturers should benefit from large backlogs, even if air travel begins to cool off. Investments in energy supply (fossil and renewable) and reshoring/onshoring trends should provide further support for the sector. Finally, segments of the sector offer some cyclical exposure relative to our two other most preferred sectors, which are more defensive.



Utilities (upgrade from neutral): Similar to consumer staples, this defensive sector should offer ballast in a portfolio, especially given some of the headwinds that we see ahead and arguably cheap valuations for a late-cycle environment. Our fixed income team's outlook for lower long-term interest rates over the balance of the year should make the sector's high dividend yield more appealing.

Neutral

Communication services (upgrade from least preferred): Competition in digital advertising, video streaming, and broadband continues to intensify. New threats are emerging with the integration of artificial intelligence

(AI) into internet search queries that will usher in a heavier investment cycle for mega-cap incumbents and pressure margins. At the same time, digital ad spending could be at risk if the US economy slips into recession later this year. However, in the near term, economic uncertainty may continue to drive investors to seek safety in high-quality mega-cap growth companies for protection. The defensive nature of telecom companies (around 15–20% of the sector) provides incremental support in an uncertain environment. Investors should be aware that the market-cap-weighted version of the sector is highly concentrated, with Alphabet and Meta accounting for roughly 60% of the total.



Energy (downgrade from most preferred): Valuations aren't demanding, but in the near term, oil markets are better supplied than we anticipated. Risks of an economic slowdown later this year may limit oil price appreciation over the next several months. Long term, we still think the outlook for the sector appears constructive given structurally tight oil markets due to substantial underinvestment in oil exploration and production since 2014.



Healthcare: The relative valuation gap with the broader market is near historical averages, making the risk-reward more balanced. Drugmakers are facing patent expiration on several large products, but promising new drug therapies in large, untapped end-markets—such as Alzheimer's and obesity—might provide some cushion. Labor shortages are easing, aiding a recovery in utilization and medical procedure volumes. Still, policy uncertainty remains a bit elevated pending the implementation of drug-pricing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as in managed care on 2024 Medicare Advantage payment rates and potential clawback of overpayments after the government’s recent audit of the industry.

Materials: A potential peak in the US dollar and the reopening of the Chinese economy are positives for the sector. However, the lagged effects of central bank tightening in the US and Europe could weigh on end-demand.



Real estate (downgrade from most preferred): Turmoil in the banking system has made financing more difficult. Companies in the sector are generally more highly indebted and rely on easy access to capital, which could be more challenging. The sector is cheap and offers a good mix of secular and cyclical exposure. But uncertainties around access to capital may linger and lead to higher costs that could prevent the sector from outperforming.



Least preferred

Consumer discretionary (downgrade from neutral): The sector has been a strong performer this year despite continued questions about consumer demand for goods and high sector valuations. Elevated mortgage rates and poor homebuyer affordability are headwinds for the housing-related segments of the sector. The sector would be particularly vulnerable if hard-landing fears become more prevalent. Investors should be aware that the market-cap-weighted version of the sector is highly concentrated, with Amazon and Tesla accounting for roughly 40% of the total.



Financials: It is possible that as the banking stress eases, the sector could experience a rebound. But fundamental headwinds will still be present such as rising funding costs as banks compete for deposits, slower loan growth if there is a broader slowdown, and increased regulatory scrutiny that could mean less return of capital to shareholders. Recession risks remain elevated, and credit costs could rise substantially if the unemployment rate climbs.



Information technology: The sector has seen a spike in its relative valuation following the recent turmoil in the banking system. Our outlook for a decline in S&P 500 profits in the quarters ahead will likely be a fundamental headwind for the sector. Enterprise tech spending tends to be correlated with overall corporate profits. Finally, semiconductor demand is also slowing in some segments, and this industry tends to be correlated with the ISM Manufacturing index, which will likely continue to be under pressure.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/credit-suisse-shares-down-ubs-takeover/,Credit Suisse shares slide after rival UBS buys it for $3.2 billion,"Credit Suisse shares plunged Monday after Swiss authorities cut a deal with its bigger rival UBS to acquire the troubled bank at a marked-down price. But European bank stocks and the wider market gained as investors watch whether moves to shore up banks will stem further upheaval in the global banking system.

Shares of Credit Suisse, whose woes stem from questions over its internal controls, fell 60% a day after UBS said it would buy the fellow Swiss bank for a lowball price of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion). Credit Suisse stocks were down 53%, trading at 93 cents a share as of 11:08 a.m. Eastern time.

Swiss regulators orchestrated the purchase in a bid to stop more turmoil after the collapse of two U.S. banks. In an indication of the frantic, behind-the-scenes deal-making by Swiss authorities to resolve the issue before markets opened, the acquisition was announced late Sunday.

There is still uncertainty over how the deal will play out for the combined bank. Analysts say some previous forced bank mergers didn't work out well for shareholders in the long run.

""Only time will tell how this shotgun wedding is received,"" said Neil Shearing, group chief economist for Capital Economics.

""While the deal may not be perfect, it takes care of a situation that has been plagued by rumor, scandal and a series of seemingly non-stop problems within Credit Suisse,"" Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial said in an email.

UBS shares initially fell on the Swiss stock exchange but had gained more than 6% in afternoon trading. The deal added volatility to other European bank stocks, which fell in early trading even as benchmark indexes climbed, before some clawed back their losses. Germany's Deutsche Bank, France's BNP Paribas and Italy's UniCredit were up, while London-based Barclays sank 3%.

Takeover by UBS

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after a central bank plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) last week failed to reassure investors and customers. Shares of Credit Suisse and other banks had tumbled last week after the failure of two banks in the U.S. raised questions about other potentially weak global financial institutions.

Many of Credit Suisse's problems were unique and unlike the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S. It has faced an array of troubles in recent years, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

Analysts and financial leaders say safeguards are stronger since the 2008 global financial crisis and that banks worldwide have plenty of available cash and support from central banks. But concerns about risks to the deal, losses for some investors and Credit Suisse's falling market value could renew fears about the health of banks.

Tobias Straumann, an economic history professor at University of Zurich, said the merger was the right move because the U.S. bank collapses and the danger to Credit Suisse was ""an international banking crisis in the making.""

""Markets are very nervous, and I think an additional accident in Switzerland would have fueled a lot of problems,"" he said.

Now, the focus will be on whether problems emerge in other banks or parts of the financial system, Shearing said.

""Containing crises is a bit like a game of whack-a-mole — with new fires starting as existing ones are extinguished,"" Shearing said.

""Too big to fail"" bank

Credit Suisse is among 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities were worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

UBS is bigger but Credit Suisse wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. It has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich through its wealth management business, and is a major mergers and acquisitions adviser. However, Credit Suisse weathered the 2008 financial crisis without assistance, unlike UBS.

Switzerland's executive branch passed an emergency ordinance allowing the merger to go through without shareholder approval.

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in higher-risk Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out, leaving investors with hefty losses. That has triggered concern about the market for those bonds and for other banks that hold them.

The combination of the two biggest and best-known Swiss banks, each with histories dating to the mid-19th century, strikes at Switzerland's reputation as a global financial center — putting it on the cusp of having a single national banking champion.

Collapse of two U.S. banks

The deal follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent further panic.

In a bid to shore up the global financial system, the world's central banks announced coordinated moves to stabilize banks, including access to a lending facility for banks to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice widely used during the 2008 crisis.

UBS officials said they plan to sell off parts of Credit Suisse or reduce the bank's size.

To support the deal, the Swiss central bank is providing a loan of up to 100 billion francs and the government is providing another 100 billion francs of support as a backstop if needed.

As the market tries to figure out what comes next after the merger, Straumann, the professor, said he wouldn't be surprised to see problems for regional banks in Europe after further interest rate increases, much like what happened to midsized banks in U.S.

""The banking system of Europe has not fully recovered from the crisis"" in 2008, he said. ""It's better, of course, than it used to be, but it's vulnerable.""",[],

March 18 (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank and Swiss regulator FINMA have told their international counterparts they regard a deal with UBS Group (UBSG.S) as the only way to prevent a collapse in confidence in Credit Suisse Group (CSGN.S), the Financial Times reported on Saturday.

UBS, Credit Suisse and key regulators are rushing to finalise a deal on the merger of the two Swiss banks as soon as Saturday evening, the FT reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

FINMA declined to comment on the FT report. UBS and Credit Suisse did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Reuters earlier reported that UBS was coming under pressure from the Swiss authorities to carry out a takeover of its local rival to get the market turmoil surrounding Credit Suisse under control. The plan could see the Swiss government offer a guarantee against the risks involved, while Credit Suisse's Swiss business could be spun off.

https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2023/03/ubs-credit-suisse-job-cuts,UBS's plan for Credit Suisse jobs,"UBS is acquiring Credit Suisse for CHF0.50 a share. Credit Suisse bankers and traders will still lose money on their deferred bonuses, but those losses will be limited to around CHF300m instead of the CHF600m they would have foregone at the initial offer of CHF0.25 a share. Good news!

The real question now though is what happens to Credit Suisse jobs, particularly at the investment bank. And, most particularly, what happens to Michael Klein's plan to spin out most of the investment bank in the form of Credit Suisse First Boston?

Credit Suisse bankers in the dark about their jobs

Senior insiders at Credit Suisse say they've had no news beyond an email which suggests the UBS deal won't close until next year. ""The implication is that it's business as usual for the next few months, although no one really knows what's going on,"" one Credit Suisse managing director tells us.

Credit Suisse's press release relating to the merger confirms that the deal is not expected to close until the end of 2023, and states that, ""until consummation of the merger, Credit Suisse will continue to conduct its business in the ordinary course and implement its restructuring measures in collaboration with UBS."" The release adds that,""UBS has expressed its confidence that the employment of the staff of Credit Suisse will be continued."" However, it also says that ""UBS is expected to appoint key personnel to Credit Suisse as soon as legally possible,"" which doesn't sound promising for senior UBS bankers.

UBS's communications on Credit Suisse jobs are more revelatory. Credit Suisse employees are being welcomed, but not universally.

UBS to Credit Suisse employees: Welcome, but there will be job cuts

""We understand that this is not an easy situation for Credit Suisse employees, but we would like to stress that we look forward to welcoming our new employees,"" said UBS chairman Colm Kelleher, speaking on today's analyst call.

UBS's broad plans for Credit Suisse's investment bank were explained in a presentation. Most notably, elements of Credit Suisse's investment bank are to be moved into a non-core unit, which UBS CFO Sarah Youngwood said will have a parameter ""broader"" than Credit Suisse's current non-core unit. UBS's press release states that the ""majority of Credit Suisse markets positions [will be] moved to non-core,"" which seems ominous for Credit Suisse salespeople and traders.

What happens to CS First Boston and to Credit Suisse' investment bankers?

What about CS First Boston? UBS CEO Ralph Hamers declined to comment on whether Michael Klein's plan for spinning out a ""super boutique"" is still viable. However, reading between the lines of statements made by UBS today, it sounds like something is taking shape in the shadows.

UBS says it sees the acquisition of Credit Suisse's investment bank as fulfilling some of its strategic goals. In particular, Credit Suisse brings a suite of investment bankers in the US and in technology, where UBS says it planned to expand anyway. ""On the global banking side, we see value in the combined entity,"" declared Hamers today. ""They provide some capabilities that are supportive to us.""

The implication is that Michael Klein and Credit Suisse's US bankers will be incorporated into UBS. Credit Suisse's European bankers may not be.

An additional CHF8bn of cost cuts, the investment bank to account for no more than 25% of RWA

UBS also plans to cut CHF8bn of cuts from the entire combined entity following the merger. Youngwood said today that these costs will come in addition to Credit Suisse's existing cost-cutting plans and that the bulk of the cost savings will come from Credit Suisse.

Many of the cuts are likely to come from the investment bank. ""The real challenge is the run down of the investment banking activities,” said Hamers of the acquisition, adding that the intention is to ""refocus the investment bank"" and that this ""will be quite some work.” Up to CHF6bn of the CHF8bn of cuts are reportedly coming from headcount spending.

UBS intends that the investment bank (excluding the non-core business) should account for no more than 25% of risk weighted assets at the combined entity following the merger.

What happens to Credit Suisse wealth management jobs in Asia?

Credit Suisse's Asian jobs may also be comparatively protected during the merger. UBS said today that there are synergies between the two banks' operations in the region. ""What Credit Suisse brings on the wealth side is quite complimentary to our strengths,"" said the bank. “Our strength in Hong Kong, Singapore and China that will now be complemented by Credit Suisse’s strength in South East Asia.”

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/29/ubs-brings-back-former-chief-oversee-credit-suisse-takeover-sergio-ermotti,UBS brings back former chief to oversee Credit Suisse takeover,"The Swiss bank UBS has announced the surprise return of Sergio Ermotti to oversee the takeover of its rival Credit Suisse, amid global concerns over the stability of the banking industry.

Ermotti served as chief executive from 2011 until 2020, overseeing UBS’s recovery from the global financial crisis. He will take over again on 5 April, when his main task will be to implement the complex merger with Credit Suisse, which was forced through by Swiss financial regulators in an attempt to prevent a chaotic collapse.

UBS took over Credit Suisse on Sunday in a £2.65bn deal that has dealt a heavy blow to the reputation of Switzerland’s banking industry. The Credit Suisse turmoil was preceded by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank this month. Regulators and investors around the world have been watching closely amid concerns that the financial difficulties could spread across the global banking system.

The bank’s decision to turn back to its former chief executive means the current boss, Ralph Hamers, will step aside after less than three years in the job. He will serve a short period as an “adviser” alongside Ermotti.

The bank said the takeover process meant it had new priorities for which Ermotti would be better placed, citing his experience in cutting back UBS’s investment bank.

Hamers, who had been a surprise choice as chief executive in 2020 because of his lack of investment banking and wealth management experience, said: “I am stepping aside in the interests of the new combined entity and its stakeholders, including Switzerland and its financial sector.”

Colm Kelleher, UBS’s chair, told a press conference on Wednesday that parts of Credit Suisse had a bad culture that UBS did not want to import, with the top priority being to stabilise the situation, Reuters reported.

Speaking alongside Kelleher, Hamers said one of Ermotti’s priorities would be reducing the size of Credit Suisse’s investment banking activities, which were not a core focus for UBS. Ermotti said the bank would not rush into making decisions.

Kelleher said he wanted to “express my deep respect and gratitude for all that Ralph has achieved over the last two-and-a-half years and for his instrumental role in delivering the Credit Suisse deal, as well as his understanding of the current situation and willingness to step down. While the acquisition will support UBS’s existing strategy, it imposes new priorities on us.”

LONDON/ZURICH, March 20 (Reuters) - Shares in UBS (UBSG.S) plunged on Monday, heading for their biggest one-day fall since 2008 after its weekend rescue of ailing rival Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) ignited concerns among investors about the long-term benefits of the deal.

UBS, with a hefty backstop from Swiss authorities, agreed to buy Credit Suisse on Sunday for just a fraction of its market value in a package orchestrated by Swiss regulators.

The bank will pay 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.23 billion) for Credit Suisse and assume up to $5.4 billion in losses.

Shares in UBS fell by as much as 16% in early trading, the most since September 2008. They were last down 15% at 14.47 francs. Since the start of March alone, they've lost almost 30% in value, set for their largest monthly loss since September 1998.

Johann Scholtz, analyst at Morningstar, said the acquisition should ultimately benefit UBS.

""A week can be a very long time in financial markets. UBS acquiring Credit Suisse for 3 billion francs a week ago would have seemed like a terrific deal. Now the position is less clear,"" he said.

""Credit Suisse likely experienced significant net outflows of client assets last week, eroding its revenue base. We, however, believe that UBS can extract value from the acquisition. It is in a much better position to execute a radical restructuring of Credit Suisse's business than Credit Suisse was,"" Scholtz added.

Credit Suisse shares slid by more than 60% to around 0.69 Swiss francs ($0.7417), while the value of its additional tier 1 (AT1) bonds - a type of bond issued by banks that make up the capital buffers regulators require them to hold - dropped as low as 1 cent on the dollar.

The Swiss regulator demanded Credit Suisse write down 16 billion Swiss francs worth of the debt to zero as part of the merger deal, angering bondholders.

A $1 billion AT1 bond with a coupon of 4.5% was bid as low as 1 cent on the dollar, Tradeweb pricing showed.

""The next few hours of trading will give us a better picture on whether the crisis is contained,"" Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said.

""In theory, there is no reason for the Credit Suisse crisis to extend, as what triggered the last quake for Credit Suisse was a confidence crisis – which doesn't concern UBS - a bank outside of the turmoil, with, in addition, ample liquidity and guarantee from the SNB (Swiss National Bank) and the government.""

At Friday's close, Credit Suisse had a total market value of $8 billion. Just six months ago, it was worth $13 billion.

JPMorgan said that although UBS stood to gain in the longer-term from the deal, the writedown of the AT1 bonds would impact other European banks.

""We believe this AT1 write-down by a systemically important bank will have negative implications for the wider European Banks’ AT1 market as well as overall funding profile and Cost of Equity for the Banks,"" JPMorgan strategists Kian Abouhossein and Amit Ranjan said in a note on Monday.

An index of European banking shares (.SX7P) tanked on Monday, losing more than 4% as shares in the likes of Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Commerzbank (CBKG.DE), Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) and BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) dropped between 5.5-7.5%.

https://www.socialeurope.eu/the-failure-of-credit-suisse-not-just-a-one-off,The failure of Credit Suisse—not just a one-off,"The bank was mismanaged but its collapse, Peter Bofinger writes, reveals a system of regulation with as many holes as a Swiss cheese.

With UBS having absorbed a discounted Credit Suisse, Swiss regulators have an even bigger bank to supervise (Peace-loving/shutterstock.com)

In the wake of the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse (CS), the narrative that the two banks were special cases—so one could therefore return to business as usual—quickly gained ground. On closer inspection, however, this is far from being valid, at least for CS.

True, the bank has a long history of mismanagement: involvement with the Bulgarian mafia from 2004 to 2007, dubious dealings involving a British subsidiary in Mozambique in 2011 and losses at the hedge funds Archegos and Greensill in 2021. And it is probably not wrong to report a ‘general rip-off mentality’ among its managers.

Recent problems should not however be reduced to past mistakes—or excessive management remuneration. The bank was not operating in a vacuum: it was under the constant supervision and monitoring of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB). In the event of chronic concerns, it was up to these institutions to urge remedial action.

‘Well placed to cope’

Yet in its financial-stability report last September, referring also to UBS, the SNB declared:

The capital position of both banks has improved further since the last Financial Stability Report. The capital ratios of Credit Suisse and UBS exceed the requirements under the Swiss ‘too big to fail’ (TBTF) regulations and are above average by international comparison.

The report also presented very positively the outcomes of stress test conducted by the SNB: ‘The results of the stress scenario analysis indicate that, thanks to their capital buffers, the two globally active Swiss banks are well placed to cope with severely adverse developments in economic and financial conditions.’

And despite all the mismanagement, the CS annual report published last month showed the bank still had 45 billion Swiss francs in equity at the end of 2022. Its auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, confirmed in that report that everything was in order. Since CS was sold to UBS shortly afterwards for only CHF3 billion, the question arises as to how such a massive loss in value—in less than three months—might be explained.

Real causes

What were the real causes of the bank’s collapse? There is no doubt it was triggered by massive withdrawals by depositors who feared losing their money in the face of so much negative news. But this was also addressed by the SNB in its stability report. In the event of ‘liquidity shocks’, it said it would provide additional liquidity, in its capacity as ‘lender of last resort’, against sufficient collateral.

This corresponds to the textbook procedure for a banking crisis, based on distinguishing solvency and liquidity problems. A bank that is insolvent, being over-indebted, must be closed or restructured immediately. A solvent bank, on the other hand, which becomes illiquid due to a withdrawal of deposits triggered by psychological factors, presents a scenario for the central bank to step in as lender of last resort. As long as the bank is sufficiently capitalised, the central bank should be able to keep it alive with liquidity assistance.

If the accounts are correct, CS was a solvent bank with above-average capital adequacy, at least until the end of 2022. As late as March 15th 2023, the SNB and FINMA explicitly affirmed that CS met the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks. If necessary, the SNB would provide liquidity.

The fundamental problem, therefore, is that the Swiss authorities were not able to rescue CS, despite their statements to the contrary, resulting in a huge loss of capital for shareholders and subordinated debt holders. For Switzerland, this raises the question of how to reform its authorities, which were incapable of recognising the bank’s problems and ensuring its survival, so that they may adequately supervise the new, extra-large UBS and effectively stabilise it in the event of a run.

No all-clear

Beyond Switzerland, the collapse of CS shows that even an above-average capital base is no guarantee of a bank’s stability in a crisis—and that stress tests, however important, should not be overestimated. If the Swiss authorities were unable to deal with a serious liquidity problem, moreover, couldn’t something similar happen in other countries?

So there is still no reason to sound the all-clear on global financial markets. The abrupt rise in central-bank policy rates since last year is a major challenge for the banking system. During the years of low interest rates, many institutions were generous in granting long-term loans, especially for housing, which are now yielding low returns. At the same time, they have been refinancing themselves with very short-term deposits.

As long as depositors remain calm, this is not a problem. But if confidence in a bank wanes, the only way for it to attract new funds is to pay the currently very high short-term interest rates for them. A liquidity problem can then quickly become a solvency issue.

This creates a conflict of objectives for central banks. Still unchecked ‘core’ inflation (excluding energy and food) argues for maintenance of a restrictive monetary policy but this increases tensions in the financial system.

This trade-off cannot be resolved but central banks can mitigate it by working with governments to make clear that solvent institutions can count on full liquidity support. In particular, the scope of government deposit insurance could be increased, at least temporarily, to reduce the risk of destabilising withdrawals in the first place.

Fundamental question

Given the complexity of global financial institutions, the more fundamental question arises as to how outsiders entrusting their money to a bank should be able to judge its quality and so impose what the literature calls ‘market discipline’. The World Bank defines this thus: ‘Market discipline refers to the process by which market participants, such as depositors and shareholders, monitor banks’ risks and take action to limit excessive risk-taking.’

Customers can certainly monitor their pizza bakers but when it comes to banks depositors are no more able to monitor the safety of the service than are the passengers of an airline. The design of institutional arrangements that provide absolutely safe assets for large depositors is therefore an open question.

The option of holding deposits directly with the central bank—a central-bank digital currency—would be very welcome. But so far, the European Central Bank’s plans for a digital euro envisage an upper limit of only €3,000, to avoid the bypassing (‘disintermediation’) of the banking system.

More holes than cheese

After a long stretch of scandals, missteps and capital destruction, what is left over from the old Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) is probably best compared to a piece of Swiss cheese, but with so many holes that you have to look hard for anything edible.

In fact, UBS (NYSE:UBS) is getting its competitor right across the Zürich Paradeplatz close to nothing: While it will pay CHF 3B in an all-stock deal, it will get more than what had traded for north of CHF 8B as recently as a few days ago, since the repayment of the CS AT1 bonds will be eliminated – which means a whopping CHF 16B less to pay out for the future owner.

Moreover, there will be significant public liquidity support and some insurance-like loss coverage by the government: Both banks involved will have access to Emergency Liquidity Assistance of CHF 50B plus another CHF 100B of additional liquidity support provided by the Swiss central bank SNB. If I heard that right during the press conference, interest on the amounts drawn would apparently be only 1.5%.

To insure UBS against unforeseeable legal and financial risks, only the first CHF 5B of losses will be borne by UBS itself, the next CHF 9B will be shouldered by the government and any further losses will be shared equally by the new owner and the government.

This agreement highlights the enormous uncertainties hiding in this apparently great deal for UBS.

On the one hand it gets its former competitor's Swiss business (which, contrary to early speculation, won't be spun off due to competitive concerns) that was said to be worth around CHF 15B alone, plus an acceleration of its own asset management business, but on the other hand it will have to deal with all kinds of troubles hiding inside the acquired toxic investment banking division. As a reminder, within less than two months in 2021 this division was capable of accumulating a total of $15B exposure to two of the largest financial scandals in recent history: Greensill and Archegos. Will there be more of this kind? Who knows.

Shareholders will need to be patient, as first of all there will be costs to bear. Only in 2027 the new owner projects the first EPS accretion from the transaction.

Transaction overview (UBS presentation)

Four years is a long time. The deal will likely bring a lot of distraction to management and employees, many of which will inevitably lose their jobs, as the new owner projects to save $8B of operating expenses by 2027. There will be dyssynergies, given that some clients which had spread their money over two different institutes will need to move some assets away from the merged entity. And there will inevitably be a series of bad news releases in my view.

Clearly, the goal of this deal was not to give a bargain to UBS, but to save the reputation of the Swiss banking system and economy. This was highlighted by the participation by none other than the Swiss President himself during the press conference presenting the transaction. Politicians were also scrambling to present the deal as a ""private market solution"", i.e. not a despicable ""public bailout"". This is true only if the ""hidden skeleton"" losses for UBS won't exceed the CHF 21B limit (CHF 16B of AT1 bonds erased today plus CHF 5B of own loss allowance). On the other hand, any other sort of transaction would have become far more costly to taxpayers: Injecting taxpayer money into Credit Suisse or letting it fail. While Swiss newspapers are already complaining in pretty bad terms about the current solution, I doubt the language would have been softer if one of the other two available solutions would have been chosen.

Why UBS might have made a bargain

Given this situation, UBS obviously entered the negotiations from a pretty strong position. I believe it knew perfectly well that any other solution than a merger would have had dramatic consequences for Switzerland as a whole and for the worldwide financial system. (It remains to be seen, though, whether the current solution will really save the ship).

The fact that it openly declined any interest in acquiring CS just a few days ago, might have been just posturing.

One detail probably shows how strong UBS' hand was: It can keep its former competitor's Swiss business. This would have been easy to spin off, but UBS managed to get a pass despite very justified competitive concerns. If the CS franchise was worth CHF 15B while having UBS as a competitor, it is certainly worth more now.

If we want to be optimistic on UBS, we can also consider that the 2027 profitability target could easily be a low-ball estimate together with the $8B cost efficiencies. Why would UBS tell the other folks involved the full synergy potential right away? Especially since cost savings involve a lot of job cuts, which are obviously not even in the interest of politicians. Only UBS can really know these figures and it would be terribly dumb to reveal its true estimates today. Just to make an example, UBS could cushion the impact of future negative news relating to the deal by announcing greater than expected cost efficiencies. And it could justify the necessity of further job cuts by pointing to additional risks and costs emerged in the meantime. So it is probably best to consider those profitability and synergy estimates not only as moving targets, but as politically useful targets which can be adapted to different situations.

If we want to be even more bullish, we can infer that the large state guarantees might just be in place to highlight potential risks to the public and CS shareholders to justify the low offer (actually UBS started by offering a third of the final tally). UBS could easily get away with a much lower cost. After all, the problems at CS were mainly liquidity and trust, leading to large capital outflows. Hence, a CHF 21B allowance for losses might abundantly cover the effective risk.

The suspension of share repurchases points into the same direction: It would not have been politically palatable to repurchase shares in this situation. At least apparently, UBS needs to keep large capital buffers. (But it won't suspend or cut its dividend and intends to keep its ""progressive"" dividend policy.)

The slide presentation includes an estimate of tangible book value accretion: On day one, the new UBS will enjoy a 74% increase of its TBVPS. While not all of this will be as profitable as the old UBS's tangible capital, it will certainly still earn a ton of money.

Overall, I tend to believe that UBS made a bargain purchase. Due to merger-related costs and some ""skeletons"" in CS's closet, it might suffer for some time, its ROE might go down for a few years, but overall it is quite hard to imagine that this deal turns out to be value-destructive for the acquirer.

But I admit that a lot of uncertainty remains, especially since we don't know if there will be other dominoes to fall and whether the capital markets will believe that this solution is really a solution. After all, people were withdrawing deposits from CS at breakneck speed until Friday. UBS credit default swaps are already rising. Nobody is out of the woods yet.

The issue with AT1 bonds

Finally, analysts were surprised to see AT1 bonds wiped out, while shareholders still get some money. Weren't these bonds supposed to be senior to equity? In this case, actually not, according to the term sheet they were at the mercy of FINMA's determinations. That said, the decision is not without risks. The loss of CHF 16B amounts to about 6% of the total amount of AT1 bonds outstanding from all European banks. There will certainly be some contagion: Part of these bonds might have been insured by other institutions, part might have been purchased by other banks, and – last, but not least – the overall market of AT1 bonds might be impacted, as investors will likely demand higher yields for these instruments going forward. And this will reduce profitability ratios for banks.

To buy or not to buy

So is UBS a buy? My hunch is yes. However, significant uncertainties remain related to the acquired liabilities and legal risks, but also to the overall stability of the global banking sector. If, one week from now, we are discussing yet another failing systemically relevant bank somewhere in the world, if U.S. regional banks continue to be under pressure, today's transaction might not bring much relief to share prices. UBS is down ~20% from its recent peak and trading for just 8x forward earnings with a ~3% dividend yield. It enjoys a ROE growing year after year and currently north of 13%, so it would be a buy on its own – in a stable environment. In the midst of a full-blown global banking crisis and after having taken over a ""bad bank"" probably not. So for me there is just not enough visibility to buy the stock.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swiss-lawmakers-pick-apart-credit-084338369.html,Swiss lawmakers pick apart Credit Suisse woes ahead of deal,"GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland’s parliament opened a special session Tuesday to scrutinize the state-imposed takeover of Swiss bank Credit Suisse by rival UBS — and consider strengthening the legal arsenal to better gird against financial blowups.

The debate could run up to three days, with lawmakers voicing — and needing to iron out — disagreements over the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.25 billion) fusion of Switzerland's top two banks, a thunderclap for a country that prides itself on finesse and acumen in finance.

Swiss authorities stepped in as shares of Credit Suisse plunged last month and depositors pulled their money after the failure of two U.S. banks sparked concerns about the stability of global financial system and the long-troubled lender. Credit Suisse is among 30 “globally systemically important banks,” and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

“The situation on the financial markets has calmed down, but it is not fully stabilized, and our country — Switzerland — has emerged shaken by this painful episode,” Swiss President Alain Berset said at the session.

He said lawmakers would need to ensure that the legal framework was “as solid as possible to prevent this kind of crisis from happening again.” The executive branch also would look into “too big to fail” rules for key banks passed after the 2008 global financial crisis that may need changing, Berset added.

Lawmakers also are considering accountability for Credit Suisse and concerns about thousands of expected job cuts and looking at state-backed guarantees of over $100 billion aimed at holding the bank together until the merger is completed and buttressing UBS against possible losses.

They also are debating what it will mean for Switzerland to have one giant bank.

Johanna Gapany, a centrist lawmaker and rapporteur for the upper chamber's finance commission, said the parliamentary panel had made three main proposals: change competition rules in light of the emergence of megabank UBS, examine how Credit Suisse executives might be held accountable and block the executive branch from unilaterally releasing more emergency funds for the rescue plan.

Story continues

The proposals showed a ""clear intention to not only prevent this situation from happening again, but to make sure that the solution protects the interests of citizens as much as possible — thus by taking the least risk with the guarantees that have been provided,” Gapany said.

Despite the talk, few concrete results were expected from the session, which is primarily to flesh out ideas — and possibly some vitriol — from lawmakers who all face reelection this fall.

Yvan Lengwiler, an economics professor at the University of Basel, suggested that the debate would play into a longtime “tug-of-war” between lawmakers who have lobbied in favor of Swiss banks over the years and others who have long sought to stiffen regulation.

“It seems that the pendulum, after this debacle we’ve seen, has clearly shifted towards strengthening,” he said. “Two years from now … the political situation might be very different, and it could be quite difficult to get this through parliament.”

Jakob Stark, an upper-house lawmaker from the populist, right-wing Swiss People's Party, said the rescue of Credit Suisse was “was probably right and ultimately unavoidable” but that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority — known as FINMA — must become ”more decisive.""

“It should, for instance, get the authority to impose fines, but then it should also really impose the fines, and particularly on the big institutions,” Stark said of the regulator. ""My feeling is that it was too considerate toward Credit Suisse, perhaps because of a legal basis that wasn’t sufficiently clear.”

The Swiss attorney general’s office has already opened a probe into events surrounding Credit Suisse ahead of the takeover, and the executive branch last week ordered tens of millions in cuts to the bonuses of top Credit Suisse executives.

Lawmakers largely were expected to line up behind the rescue plan — even if reluctantly for some — and were not yet expected to authorize a parliamentary investigation of the epochal rescue of Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old pillar of Swiss banking.

Lengwiler, who specializes in financial market regulation, noted that the combined bank will have a balance sheet that will be twice as large as Switzerland’s annual economy.

That’s nothing new: Both Credit Suisse and UBS had bigger balance sheets than the Swiss economy before the 2008 financial crisis. But this combined bank will be unprecedented in size and heft, presenting new challenges for government officials.

“What’s new here is that it’s the only kid on the block now,” Lengwiler said. “UBS is really the only game in town and … has become extremely dominant, and that is a problem for Switzerland.”

“It’s maybe too large for the country,” he added.

The deal, brokered by the Swiss authorities, will allow UBS to combine its US operations and business with Credit Suisse’s US subsidiaries. UBS sought approval on March 22, and as part of the agreement, it will provide an implementation plan to the Fed for the amalgamation within three months of closing the deal.

The Fed has mandated that UBS provide a plan including liquidity standards and compliance with more stringent “enhanced prudential standards.” The UBS-Credit Suisse investment banking deal has strengthened measures because of the increased size of the institution.

As per US bank merger laws, the Federal Reserve must review bank mergers when a bank with more than $250 billion of total assets purchases any voting shares of a company with assets of $10 billion or more. Swiss authorities are primarily involved in the merger between the European nation’s banking giants, but the US central bank had to weigh in as each institution has American operations. The Fed’s decision cleared the way for UBS to acquire all US units of Credit Suisse.

Investor confidence in Switzerland’s largest bank, Credit Suisse, was shaken last month following the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank based in the US. To curb further banking turbulence, Swiss authorities announced that Credit Suisse would be purchased by UBS, which had also almost collapsed.

UBS agreed to acquire Credit Suisse for a significantly reduced price of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion) compared to its previous market value. As per the takeover agreement, shareholders will be awarded $3.23 billion, while holders of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds will receive no compensation despite typically ranking below shareholders in terms of payment hierarchy.

Earlier this month, European Union antitrust regulators granted UBS temporary approval, but the bank still needs to obtain clearance under EU merger regulations. Meanwhile, according to a Reuters report, the Bank of England has reportedly approved the takeover in the United Kingdom. UBS anticipates the acquisition will result in a business with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.

UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher called the acquisition a significant milestone for Switzerland and the global financial industry but cautioned that it carries a “huge amount of risk.” The takeover will take at least three to four years, excluding Credit Suisse’s non-core investment bank portfolio, which will have more than $5 trillion in total invested assets.",['Chinmay Bohra'],2023-04-15 07:15:04+00:00

Credit Suisse, the battered Swiss bank, has agreed to an emergency takeover by its rival UBS, Switzerland’s largest bank, a move engineered by the Swiss government to stave off immediate concerns of a global financial crisis. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The hasty deal, which was announced Sunday following a weekend of negotiations, offers a temporary reprieve after days of panic in global markets triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. But it does little to ease longer-term worries of instability in the banking system.

A “swift and stabilizing solution was absolutely necessary,” Alain Berset, president of the Swiss Confederation, said during a Sunday afternoon news conference. The UBS deal, he added, was “the best solution for restoring the confidence that has been lacking in financial markets recently.”

Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell said in a joint statement Sunday afternoon that they “welcome” the announcement.

“The capital and liquidity positions of the U.S. banking system are strong, and the U.S. financial system is resilient,” they wrote. “We have been in close contact with our international counterparts to support their implementation.”

But many banking experts remain doubtful that the banking turmoil is over.

""The forced merger of UBS and Credit Suisse ends one potentially systemic problem, but this is far from over,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the consulting firm RSM. “Now the question is: What other banks are at risk and what is the nature of that risk? This is the start of a multi-month adjustment.”

UBS is paying 3 billion Swiss francs, or $3.3 billion, for Credit Suisse in an all-stock deal, which is well under the bank’s market value of $8 billion as of Friday. The Swiss National Bank said it would lend up to 100 billion Swiss francs, or about $108 billion, to help facilitate the takeover.

In addition, Swiss authorities are planning to speed up the process by circumventing laws that would require a shareholder vote, UBS executives said Sunday.

The Credit Suisse announcement coincided with a coordinated move by central banks to ease strains in dollar funding markets and signal confidence in the global system. The Fed, Bank of Canada, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank said they would expand the frequency of dollar swap line operations, moving from weekly to daily, starting Monday.

The template has been used before in 2008 and 2020 to ease market uncertainty and stave off broader panic. The goal is to ensure that central banks can hold on to easy access to dollar funding, which can dry up when the market is under strain.

“The action today made sure that any dollar funding pressure [is] quashed to ensure payments clear,” Brusuelas said. “It’s preventive action to make sure the plumbing of the global financial architecture keeps flowing.”

The moves over the weekend are expected to tee up another bumpy week. The Fed is set to convene Tuesday and Wednesday for its March policy meeting, where policymakers will craft a fresh set of economic projections. They are expected to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point at the conclusion of the two-day meeting. But they will eventually pause rate increases to limit any hazardous consequences of the Fed’s aggressive campaign to fight inflation.

Just two weeks ago, some Fed watchers speculated that the central bank might go with half a percentage point, fearing the economy was showing signs of heating back up. But that possibility vanished within days as concerns grew that the repercussions of the Fed’s inflation fight might disrupt the nation’s own financial stability.

Credit Suisse woes

The takeover of Credit Suisse caps more than a week of speculation over the Swiss giant’s fate amid growing fears of a global financial crisis after two U.S. regional banks, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank of New York, failed this month. Although U.S. regulators have taken sweeping steps, including backstopping deposits, those measures have not done enough to assuage fears of a cascading banking crisis.

Those concerns went global in recent days, after Credit Suisse warned of “material weaknesses” in its financial reporting. On Thursday, the bank received $53.7 billion in emergency funds from Switzerland’s central bank, but it wasn’t enough to restore confidence in the bank’s viability. Shares of Credit Suisse have tumbled more than 20 percent in the past week, and more than 75 percent from a year ago.

Credit Suisse’s downfall stemmed from years of poor decisions and scandals. A long stretch of mismanagement, compliance issues and a critical data breach contributed to the trouble, including roughly $8 billion in losses last year alone.

Then, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank this month set off widespread alarm in the banking system, which helped sink Credit Suisse’s stock price by 14 percent in one day.

“Credit Suisse was already on shaky ground,” said John Sedunov, a finance professor at Villanova University. “There was a confluence of factors, a confluence of missteps along the way that got us here. But most recently, people started to panic. They looked for weak spots, and Credit Suisse happened to be a big one.”

The banking behemoth’s mounting problems, he said, were “a much bigger deal globally” than SVB’s collapse. Letting Credit Suisse fail would have been catastrophic to the European banking system and undermined Switzerland’s standing as a global financial center.

“The Swiss government had too much to lose to let this fail,” Sedunov said. “This deal was done in-house, with a white knight from within. It was very important for Switzerland that this stayed within borders for them.”

But the merger of two major financial institutions is likely to bring its own set of challenges. UBS plans to slash Credit Suisse’s investment banking arm in hopes of bringing it in line with a more “conservative risk culture,” UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said during a news conference Sunday.

Analysts noted that the “shotgun wedding” between UBS and Credit Suisse provides immediate financial stability but raises worrisome questions about the next domino that could fall.

“The [Credit Suisse] drama now shifts from negotiation risk to execution risk, which the Swiss authorities are moving aggressively to manage down, but is not zero,” Evercore ISI’s Krishna Guha and Peter Williams wrote in an analyst note on Sunday. “Market focus will likely broaden out to other weaker European banks as well as U.S. regional banks.”

Eyes on the Fed

The past week has also raised new questions on what it will take to avert another international crisis, and who is to blame for the damage already done. The Wall Street Journal and New York Times reported over the weekend that the Fed’s warnings about Silicon Valley Bank stretched back more than a year, but those ultimately fell short.

The Fed is investigating the glaring gap in oversight, with the probe headed by Michael S. Barr, the Fed’s chief banking cop. Those results are expected to be made public by May 1.

Lawmakers are also increasing their scrutiny. On Sunday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called on Congress to lift the federal insurance cap for bank deposits above $250,000, one week after the Biden administration announced it would protect all depositors at Silicon Valley Bank, regardless of how much money they had in the failing institution. Warren, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee and is a commercial and bankruptcy law expert, suggested raising that figure to anywhere from $2 million to $10 million during an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

She also urged lawmakers to repeal a provision of the 2018 law that had loosened restrictions on banks with $50 billion or more in assets, saying the latest tumult in the financial system underscored her belief that the Fed has fallen short in its core duties. Calling for an end to rate increases, she said higher borrowing costs don’t do anything to solve the economy’s root problems and risk putting people out of work in the meantime.

March 17 (Reuters) - Banking giant UBS (UBSG.S) is in discussions to take over all or parts of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), with the boards of Switzerland's two biggest lenders set to meet separately over the weekend, the Financial Times reported on Friday.

The Swiss National Bank and regulator FINMA are organising the talks in an attempt to build confidence in the country's banking sector, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

On Friday evening, Swiss regulators informed their counterparts in the United States and United Kingdom that the merger of the two banks was their ""Plan A"" to salvage the confidence in Credit Suisse, the report added.

Several other options are also under discussion between the two banks as both sides try to evaluate regulatory constraints in different jurisdictions, the newspaper reported.

The Swiss central bank's focus is on agreeing a straightforward solution before markets open on Monday, the report said, adding there is no guarantee a deal will be reached.

Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment on the report. The Swiss National Bank and FINMA did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.

Bloomberg reported on Thursday that UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse were opposed to a forced merger, with UBS preferring to focus on its own wealth-centric strategy and reluctant to take on risks related to its smaller rival.

Credit Suisse is biggest bank to be ensnared in the market turmoil following the collapse of U.S. lenders SVB and New York-based Signature Bank, forcing the Swiss lender to borrow up to $54 billion from Switzerland's central bank to shore up liquidity.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ubs-offers-buy-back-own-055624348.html,UBS Offers Bond Buyback To Soothe Concerns on Deal’s Risk,"(Bloomberg) -- UBS Group AG is offering to buy back bonds that were issued days before it agreed to take over troubled rival Credit Suisse Group AG, a deal that sent a gauge of its credit risk soaring.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Switzerland’s biggest bank invited holders of $3 billion of its senior bonds to sell them back after acquisition in an effort to calm concerns over the risks of the deal. While shareholders have cheered UBS picking up its rival at a very cheap price, its bond prices have dropped in recent days and credit ratings companies have lowered their outlook on the bank’s debt.

UBS, which had seen its stock rise the past two years on the pitch of stability, has signed up for years of a complicated integration effort and restructuring to cut at least $8 billion of costs. But the Swiss firm is betting the payoff will be worth it to add to its profitable wealth business, and it has 56 billion francs of badwill and a government guarantee on some losses to protect its downside.

The decision was a “reasonable action to give investors the option to sell back the bonds should they, having known what they know now, have chosen not to invest,” said Andrew Wong, a credit analyst at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.

UBS made the buyback offer to holders of its senior unsecured notes due in March 2028 and March 2032, totaling 2.75 billion euros ($3 billion), to tender the securities for cash at their respective re-offer price, citing the “exceptional corporate actions” of March 19. That was the day UBS agreed to buy its rival in a government-brokered deal aimed at containing a financial market selloff sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this month.

Story continues

The bank’s senior, euro-denominated bonds rose after the offer. While shares dropped 2% on Wednesday, its 11% jump since the deal was announced is one of the biggest rises this week among European banks.

UBS’s credit risk has been jolted since concern over Credit Suisse’s fate, and the role UBS would play in it, roiled global markets. After a deal was announced over the weekend, the cost of insuring UBS’s debt for one year soared to a record. But also, the credit default swaps for the holding company rose above those for its operating company, UBS AG, by the most on record.

“UBS Group is the entity that is taking over the risk from the Credit Suisse acquisition, while its operating company should remain better protected,” Suvi Platerink Kosonen, a banking credit analyst with ING Groep NV, said on Tuesday. “From that angle it makes sense that the spreads of the group will widen and underperform against the OpCo.”

S&P Global Inc. revised its outlook on its A- rating on UBS Group to negative on execution risk from the acquisition, but maintained a stable outlook on the operating company.

The two securities are UBS V4.625% 03/17/28 and UBS V4.75% 03/17/32

The buyback offer opens on March 22, with the early expiration deadline on March 28 and the final expiration deadline on April 4

“The issuer has decided to launch this exercise as a result of a prudent assessment of these recent developments and the Issuer’s long-term commitment to its credit investors,” UBS said in statement. A bank spokesman declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg

The bonds were priced in the public market on March 9 and were settled on March 17. There’s typically a period of gray market trading between a bond’s pricing and settlement

The two so-called bail-in bonds were priced on March 9, just as the first signs of trouble emerged at SVB Financial Group. The 2032 note was indicated at a price of 99.00 cents at 12:30pm in London on Wednesday, below its re-offer price of 99.518 cents, according to pricing compiled by Bloomberg. The 2028 debt was indicated at 99.67 cents with a re-offer price of 99.932 cents.

These securities are risky, but they’re still safer than Additional Tier 1 notes, which are the most junior bonds in a bank’s debt pile.

“It seems fair and reasonable to let investors think twice if they need to reconsider the risks, which is helpful in shoring up sentiment eventually if not immediately,” said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis SA.

An arena that was made for music and built for hockey, the Oak View Group (OVG) owned and operated UBS Arena now also serves as a benchmark of sustainability in the sports and entertainment industry.

LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), is the most widely used green building rating system in the world and an international symbol of excellence. Through design, construction and operations practices that improve environmental and human health, LEED-certified buildings are helping to make the world more sustainable.

“We designed UBS Arena to set a standard for the future of sports and entertainment venues, and key to this approach was an emphasis on sustainable and thoughtful design,” said Populous senior principal Jason Carmello. “We are thrilled to see the efforts of Oak View Group and the entire project team recognized as UBS Arena achieves LEED certification.”

Key strategies employed by the project team to achieve the certification include:

UBS Arena’s high performance is specifically designed to reduce energy costs. UBS Arena uses heat recovery technology, LED lighting, high-performance glass and other efficient design practices to reduce energy by over 15%.

The building provides air quality exceeding the ASHRAE 62.1-2010 standard to provide comfort and well-being for occupants, including the use of MERV13 air filters.

UBS Arena’s location and proximity to local transit services for guests and visitors helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.

Native plants and high efficiency irrigation strategies help reduce the arena’s outdoor water consumption by over 50%, saving water and promoting healthy ecosystems with local habitat restoration.

The venue provides dedicated recycling stations to minimize the building’s operation waste stream by diverting glass, metal, paper, cardboard and plastic from landfills.

The venue is designed to reduce indoor potable water use by over 40% with the installation of low-flow flush and flow fixtures.

UBS Arena uses all environmentally-friendly cleaning products. This puts less stress on the local water system and promotes a healthy ecosystem.

The shade trees and site landscape provide multiple benefits like combating the urban heat island effect, reducing rainwater runoff, promoting habitats through healthy ecosystems and creating opportunities to connect with nature.

“We are excited that UBS Arena was awarded LEED certification. This acknowledgement highlights the dedication we put forth in its efforts to be environmentally conscious when designing and constructing our venue,” said Kim Stone, President of UBS Arena and Executive Vice President of OVG East Coast. “As a founding member of GOAL (Green Operations & Advanced Leadership) and the first OVG Owned & Operated venue to achieve this prestigious certification, we’re proud that UBS Arena is at the forefront of sustainability.”

https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-meets-weigh-options-under-pressure-merge-with-ubs-2023-03-18/,UBS seeks $6 billion in government guarantees for Credit Suisse takeover,"













March 18 (Reuters) - UBS AG (UBSG.S) is asking the Swiss government to cover about $6 billion in costs if it were to buy Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), a person with knowledge of the talks said, as the two sides raced to hammer together a deal to restore confidence in the ailing Swiss bank.

The 167-year-old Credit Suisse is the biggest name ensnared in the turmoil unleashed by the collapse of U.S. lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank over the past week, spurring a rout in banking stocks and prompting authorities to rush out extraordinary measures to keep banks afloat.

The $6 billion in government guarantees UBS is seeking would cover the cost of winding down parts of Credit Suisse and potential litigation charges, two people told Reuters.

One of the sources cautioned that the talks to resolve the crisis of confidence in Credit Suisse are encountering significant obstacles, and 10,000 jobs may have to be cut if the two banks combine.

Swiss regulators are racing to present a solution for Credit Suisse before markets reopen on Monday, but the complexities of combining two behemoths raises the prospect that talks will last well into Sunday, said the person, who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the situation.

Credit Suisse, UBS and the Swiss government declined to comment.

The frenzied weekend negotiations come after a brutal week for banking stocks and efforts in Europe and the U.S. to shore up the sector. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration moved to backstop consumer deposits while the Swiss central bank lent billions to Credit Suisse to stabilize its shaky balance sheet.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (BRKa.N) Warren Buffett has held discussions with senior Biden administration officials about the banking crisis, a source told Reuters.

The White House and U.S. Treasury declined to comment. Bloomberg News reported earlier that Buffett had been in touch with the administration in recent days about the regional banking crisis, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday. The source declined to elaborate on the details of the discussions.

UBS was under pressure from the Swiss authorities to carry out a takeover of its local rival to get the crisis under control, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The plan could see Credit Suisse's Swiss business spun off.

Switzerland is preparing to use emergency measures to fast-track the deal, the Financial Times reported, citing two people familiar with the situation.

U.S. authorities are involved, working with their Swiss counterparts to help broker a deal, Bloomberg News reported, also citing those familiar with the matter.

British finance minister Jeremy Hunt and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey are also in regular contact this weekend over the fate of Credit Suisse, a source familiar with the matter said. Spokespeople for the British Treasury and the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority, which oversees lenders, declined to comment.

FORCEFUL RESPONSE

Credit Suisse shares lost a quarter of their value in the last week. It was forced to tap $54 billion in central bank funding as it tries to recover from a string of scandals that have undermined the confidence of investors and clients.

The company ranks among the world's largest wealth managers and is considered one of 30 global, systemically important banks whose failure would ripple throughout the entire financial system.

The banking sector's fundamentals are stronger and the global systemic linkages are weaker than during the 2008 global financial crisis, Goldman analyst Lotfi Karoui wrote in a late Friday note to clients. That limits the risk of a ""potential vicious circle of counterparty credit losses,"" Karoui said.

""However, a more forceful policy response is likely needed to bring some stability,"" Karoui said. The bank said the lack of clarity on Credit Suisse's future will pressure the broader European banking sector.

A senior official at China's central bank said on Saturday that high interest rates in the major developed economies could continue to cause problems for the financial system.

There were multiple reports of interest for Credit Suisse from other rivals. Bloomberg reported that Deutsche Bank was looking at the possibility of buying some of its assets, while U.S. financial giant BlackRock (BLK.N) denied a report that it was participating in a rival bid for the bank.

Credit Suisse and First Republic Bank

INTEREST RATE RISK

The failure of California-based Silicon Valley Bank brought into focus how a relentless campaign of interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks - including the European Central Bank this week - was pressuring the banking sector. SVB and Signature's collapses are the second- and third-largest bank failures in U.S. history behind the demise of Washington Mutual during the global financial crisis in 2008.

Banking stocks globally have been battered since SVB collapsed, with the S&P Banks index (.SPXBK) falling 22%, its largest two weeks of losses since the pandemic shook markets in March 2020.

Big U.S. banks threw a $30 billion lifeline to smaller lender First Republic (FRC.N), and U.S. banks altogether have sought a record $153 billion in emergency liquidity from the Federal Reserve in recent days.

A coalition of midsize U.S. banks, Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America (MBCA), asked regulators to extend FDIC insurance to all deposits for the next two years, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday, citing an MBCA letter to regulators.

In Washington, focus has turned to greater oversight to ensure that banks and their executives are held accountable.

Biden called on Congress to give regulators greater power over the sector, including imposing higher fines, clawing back funds and barring officials from failed banks.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.

Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.

Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.

One company to watch right now is UBS (UBS). UBS is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and an A for Value.

We should also highlight that UBS has a P/B ratio of 1.31. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. UBS's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.57. Over the past 12 months, UBS's P/B has been as high as 1.34 and as low as 0.86, with a median of 1.02.

Finally, our model also underscores that UBS has a P/CF ratio of 7.24. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. UBS's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 13.40. UBS's P/CF has been as high as 7.52 and as low as 4.98, with a median of 6.21, all within the past year.

These are just a handful of the figures considered in UBS's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that UBS is an impressive value stock right now.

Deal of the Century?

Barclays (BCS) bought parts of Lehman Brothers, after the latter filed for bankruptcy in 2008. They got a first-class investment bank for $250 million and its New York headquarters building for $1.5 billion. The investment bank was acquired for the tiniest of fractions of where it would have traded only weeks before. Barclays got that deal because they were one of the only firms, if not the only firm, that could absorb Lehman at the time.

I see similarities in UBS's (NYSE:UBS) acquisition of Credit Suisse (CS) over the weekend. UBS was probably the only possible buyer for CS, and it got an even sweeter deal than Barclays got. This deal will pay off for UBS immediately and then drive gains for years to come. I see around 20% in short-term upside with over 50% gains over the next 2-3 years and extremely limited downside.

Swiss Government Picking Pockets

Credit Suisse had over $48 billion of equity at the time of the transaction. Furthermore, about $17 billion of AT1 paper (categorized under debt) was wiped out by the SNB (Swiss National Bank), which moves dollar for dollar to equity.

That means that UBS is adding $65 billion of equity for the cost of $3 billion of stock. My quick math tells me that's $62 billion of added value, almost 21x. It immediately adds 75% to UBS's tangible book value to $25/share (versus the current price of $20.50/share as of the time of this writing). Now there will undoubtedly be losses as UBS writes down the value of CS's assets and absorbs some operating losses and restructuring costs. UBS is getting a sweet deal here too. They are on the hook for the first $5 billion of these losses, and then the SNB takes on the next $9 billion of losses. Any losses above that total of $14 billion is split 50/50 between UBS and CS. If you just add the initial loss absorption and the entry cost/benefit, UBS is paying a total of $8 billion for $71 billion of value.

UBS Future Earnings Power

UBS will almost certainly shrink the investment bank at CS. The company laid out that, post-merger and clean-up, it will be a $5 trillion wealth manager and the largest retail bank in Switzerland (50% larger than its next largest competitor).

UBS pro forma wealth manager (UBS Management Presentation) UBS retail bank deposits (UBS Management Presentation)

The new bank will be 80% wealth management and 20% this Swiss retail banking giant. That mix ought to gain a nice multiple bump from 9x to 12x, where Morgan Stanley (MS) trades.

Any multiple would be a plus. UBS is estimating that this deal will be earnings accretive by 2027. I think they are sandbagging here. They estimate that they will be able to realize about $8 billion of cost savings by 2027. If we straight line that over four years, it's an incremental $0.57/share per year of earnings power pre-tax starting year one and growing to $2.25/share. This will be offset initially by markdowns and losses, which will cap out at $5 billion. I think that the market will look through these writedowns and focus on the operating profit growth. Just putting a 9x multiple on that incremental earnings power is about $20 of value. More than double where the stock is right now.

Risk

There will be operational risk here, particularly with integration issues. There's also just the normal risk of UBS's current exposure to worldwide asset values. Lastly, the crushing of CS AT1s will hurt UBS's cost of funding as people assume risk with UBS's paper. Once again, however, the SNB is backstopping UBS with $100 billion of available liquidity. Their funding is secure.

Conclusion

Overall, gifts like this are rarely available in the market and even more rare for governments to play such a huge role in creating value for a private enterprise. I think any risk of loss from CS assets or operational snafus is way more than compensated for by the day-one boost in tangible book value and then future growth in profitability (without assuming any revenue synergies). I see a 20-25% short-term upside to the new $25 book value and potential for a 100% upside over the next few years as earnings grow without considering potential multiple expansion.

UBS plans to buy Credit Suisse for $1 billion

UBS (NYSE:UBS) has offered to buy Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) for up to $1B in an all-share deal, with the Swiss government planning to change laws to bypass a shareholder vote on the deal, according to a Financial Times report today.

The proposed deal is set to be signed as soon as Sunday evening at a fraction of Credit Suisse's closing price on Friday. This week alone, Credit Suisse's shares have dropped more than 24% amid a series of scandals that have led to a decline in investor and client confidence, forcing the company to obtain $54B in central bank funding.

The proposed offer was made on Sunday morning at a price of 0.25 Swiss francs ($0.27) per share to be paid in UBS stock, as per the newspaper report, citing people familiar with the matter. Credit Suisse's shares closed at 1.86 Swiss francs on Friday.

However, the acquisition talks are encountering significant obstacles, and 10,000 jobs may have to be cut if the two banks combine. According to a Reuters report earlier today, UBS is seeking $6B in government guarantees for the takeover, which would cover the cost of winding down parts of Credit Suisse and potential litigation charges.

T-Mobile US buys Ka’ena for $1.35B

T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) announced on Wednesday that it will acquire Ka’ena Corporation and its subsidiaries, including popular prepaid wireless brand Mint Mobile, part-owned by Ryan Reynolds; international calling service Ultra Mobile; and wholesaler Plum. T-Mobile will pay a maximum of $1.35B, consisting of 39% cash and 61% stock, for the acquisition. The final price will be determined based on Ka’ena's performance during specific periods both before and after the transaction closes.

Pfizer to buy Seagen for $43B

Seagen (NASDAQ:SGEN) shares jumped more than 14% on Monday after it was announced that Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) has entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Seagen for $43 billion or $229 per share. The acquisition, which is set to become Pfizer's largest acquisition since 2009, is aimed at helping the company offset the decline in sales of its COVID-19 vaccines. The deal is expected to be completed in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to customary closing conditions.

Seagen shares gained 16% for the week, while Pfizer shares closed the week with a nearly 2% rise.

TikTok in talks with potential buyers amid U.S. pressure for a ban

TikTok is in talks with potential buyers, despite resistance from its Chinese owners to sell the app under pressure from the Biden administration, New York Post reported on Thursday, citing sources familiar with the matter. The company is considering deals that were previously explored during the Trump administration's threat to ban the app. One of these deals involved Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) partnering with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to own a U.S. TikTok subsidiary.

Calls for a forced divestiture of TikTok from its Chinese parent, ByteDance, are growing among politicians from both sides of the aisle.

Motive Partners in talks to acquire ACI Worldwide

ACI Worldwide (NASDAQ:ACIW) shares surged more than 4% on Friday after Bloomberg reported that Motive Partners is in talks to purchase the company, citing people familiar with the matter. Motive is currently seeking financing for the potential acquisition, but no final deal has been reached yet.

Earlier this month, ACI Worldwide reported its Q4 results, with both EPS and revenues coming in better than the consensus estimates.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ubs-most-reliant-at1-bonds-093054012.html,UBS Most Reliant on AT1 Bonds Wiped Out in Credit Suisse Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- UBS Group AG is more reliant for its capital on the type of risky bonds that were wiped out in the Credit Suisse Group AG takeover than any other major lender in Europe.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Additional Tier 1 bonds, or AT1s, are the equivalent of about 28% of the Swiss lender’s highest quality regulatory capital, according to Bloomberg calculations. That’s just slightly more than for Barclays Plc, while the average exposure among the 16 biggest banks in Europe is about 16%.

The notes have been a key way for banks to bolster their financial resources because they are typically cheaper than normal equity such as shares. They were created by European regulators after the financial crisis as a way to impose losses on creditors when banks start to fail without resorting to taxpayer money.

“From a capital perspective, if AT1 funding costs rise by an extreme amount over time, we believe there may potentially arise a situation in which banks look to replace AT1 capital with CET1 capital,” Goldman Sachs analysts led by Chris Hallam wrote in a note.

A historic writedown of 16 billion francs ($17.2 billion) of the risky bonds issued by Credit Suisse has sent shockwaves through the market, with bondholders arguing that shareholders should have taken the first hit. Regulators in the European Union and UK reiterated on Monday that equities should take losses before any bonds in their jurisdictions.

AT1 bonds have historically been a cheaper way for banks to boost their capital, but the events of the past few days have turned that on its head.

Major European banks’ cost of equity capital now averages 13.4%, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s lower than the average yield across AT1 bonds, which jumped to 15.3% after the Credit Suisse wipeout. In early February, yields on AT1s stood at 7.8%, according to a multi-currency index compiled by Bloomberg.

Story continues

In Europe, no other major banks besides Credit Suisse and UBS have provisions that would allow for the full writedown of this type of bond, according to senior Bloomberg Intelligence credit analyst Jeroen Julius. This feature allowed equity investors to maintain some value as bondholders were wiped out.

UBS didn’t respond to a request for comment. Barclays didn’t have an immediate comment.

“A likely development is the cost of issuing such bonds will increase to reflect increased perceived default risk,” Credit Suisse banking analysts including Jon Peace wrote in a note. “At the margin this could reduce somewhat European banks’ profitability.” The team published a similar chart on AT1s on Monday.

In a report released on Tuesday, the Swiss lender cited a drop in crude inventories and supply disruption from northern Iraq of almost 500,000 barrels per day as additional factors supporting prices that could rally towards $100 per barrel. UBS expects oil prices to recover towards $100 per barrel over the coming quarters as the combined voluntary production cuts by the nine oil producers will help tighten the oil market further.



On April 2nd, OPEC+ members including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, and Algeria announced that they would introduce combined voluntary oil production cuts of 1.16 million barrels per day from May until the end of this year. Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter and OPEC's largest producer, agreed to cut its output by 500,000 bpd from May until the end of the year, while the UAE will cut its output by 144,000 bpd for the same period. Russia, which is part of the 23-member OPEC+ group, said the 500,000 bpd cut it was implementing from March to June would continue until the end of the year.



UBS analysts Giovanni Staunovo, Wayne Gordon, and Dominic Schnider wrote in the report, “While flows may resume [from Iraq] in the short term, the interruption and the upcoming voluntary production cuts by nine oil producers should help tighten the oil market further” [1]. The precautionary measure was aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market, according to the producers.



The report highlights the potential for oil prices to recover towards $100 per barrel as a result of the voluntary production cuts. However, the report also notes that the situation remains uncertain due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and other factors that could impact oil demand and supply. The report states that while the recent OPEC+ production cuts will provide support to oil prices, the market will remain vulnerable to unexpected events such as supply disruptions or changes in demand patterns.



In conclusion, UBS has predicted that the voluntary production cuts by nine members of the OPEC+ group will help tighten the oil market and boost prices. While the recent cuts provide support to oil prices, the market remains vulnerable to unexpected events such as supply disruptions or changes in demand patterns. The situation remains uncertain due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions, and as such, the trajectory of oil prices remains uncertain in the coming quarters.

Background: Originally from the Boston area, Rebecca Glasgow “always had an interest in numbers” and was planning to be a math major at Cornell University before switching to economics. She launched her career in wealth management shortly after graduation, doing municipal sales and institutional trading in Boston before moving to Washington, D.C., to join the financial planning arm of Lincoln Financial Group. Glasgow eventually moved to Atlanta and joined UBS in 2008, serving as a senior partner at the ESOP Group, one of just a handful of teams across the country that specializes in tax deferral strategy revolving around employee stock ownership plans.

Lessons Learned: Glasgow joined UBS at the height of the 2008 financial crisis and vividly remembers the many different conversations she was having about investments or what clients were going through. “Learning to have those hard conversations is essential—although not comfortable at the time, they will build the relationship in a way that can’t be replicated,” she says.

Investment Philosophy/Strategy: With many former business owners as clients, Glasgow and her team specialize in tax deferral strategies, formulating investment recommendations in conjunction with those plans. Client portfolios are designed “so that there is enough liquidity to get through uncertain times and clients don’t have to worry about making sure they have the money to pay the bills,” says Glasgow. Amid market uncertainty in the last year, she has been making tactical changes that include leaning a bit more toward value and paring back on international exposure.

Investment Outlook: Glasgow has a cautious outlook for 2023 and expects more volatility ahead in markets. “Never in my career have I seen so many analysts and bright minds on Wall Street be as negative as they have been in the last couple of months,” she says.

Best Advice: “Have a plan and if you have new money to put to work, pick where your entry points are going to be in advance,” says Glasgow. “Think about earning income on that money while you wait and use tax planning to your advantage . . . we’re not reacting in the short term.”

Gender Diversity: Wealth management still has work to be done in terms of diversity. Glasgow sees some advantages to being a woman in the industry, mainly the “trust factor,” as women are inherently more nurturing. “Women pay attention to all aspects of clients' lives and not necessarily just the financial ones—that goes a long way in building relationships,” she adds.

Key Facts

Credit Suisse shares slid more than 60% at the start of trading on Monday morning in Zurich, continuing a poor streak that saw shares hit an all-time low last week. UBS shares also dropped more than 9% in early trading. Other leading European banks, including BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Santander and Deutsche Bank were also down between 3% and 6% on Monday morning. They lead a broader market dip in Europe, with key indexes also down, including London’s FTSE 100 (0.8%), Germany’s Dax (0.35%), France's CAC (0.3%) and Spain’s Ibex (1.04%). The price of oil also hit its lowest level since December 2021, with Brent crude, a major international benchmark, falling 2.5%, continuing a recent downwards trend and approaching $70 a barrel.

News Peg

UBS announced plans to buy its beleaguered Swiss rival Credit Suisse on Sunday. The $3.2 billion deal, partly an effort to calm roiling financial markets, is a huge discount given Credit Suisse’s market valuation and heralds the creation of a new Swiss banking behemoth and the start of a new era for lending in Switzerland. It also marks the demise of a once stalwart member of the global financial system that for years was considered too big and too important to fail. Years of unrest following a string of controversies—including charges of money laundering, sanctions breaches, corruption, fraud and tax evasion, links with collapsed firms Archegos and Greensill Capital and revelations it had spied on its own staff—eroded that position. Its position grew terminal last week after its delayed annual report acknowledged “material weaknesses” in financial reporting and sent shares into freefall.

What To Watch For

Credit Suisse’s downfall comes at a poor time for global financial markets, which are already reeling from the recent failure of two U.S. institutions: Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature. Credit Suisse bondholders are likely to be angry following the deal, as their investments are likely to be wiped out, a move that could exacerbate market worries. Though the troubled Swiss bank’s problems long predate the collapse of the two institutions, the loss of such a historic institution will also undoubtedly intensify concerns. In premarket trading early Monday morning, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase were down more than 1% and Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America between 0.4% and 0.6%. From market close on Friday, all were down between 3% and 4% on Monday morning.

Tangent

Asian markets also responded negatively to the news of UBS’ acquisition. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell more than 2.6% on Monday. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was also down 1.4% and the Shanghai Composite Index down 0.48%.

UBS has struck a deal to purchase troubled Credit Suisse for $3.2 billion, as bank solvency fears continue to batter global markets.

Why it matters: Aggressive central bank action to arrest stubborn inflation has shaken investor confidence, with financial institutions caught in the crosshairs.

The details: Under the terms of the all-share transaction, Credit Suisse shareholders will receive 1 UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares, for a total consideration of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion). The deal is expected to be finalized by year-end.

UBS offer represents a fraction of the bank's roughly $8.5 billion market capitalization as of Friday's close.

The Swiss National Bank agreed to lend up to 100 billion francs to UBS to support the transaction.

Finma, the Swiss financial regulator, took the extraordinary step of enforcing that $17 billion worth of higher-risk Credit Suisse’s bonds would be wiped out. The regulator also eliminated the need for shareholders to vote on the deal.

Flashback: After years of mismanagement and scandal-ridden headlines, the storied 167-year-old European banking giant was laid low by a crisis rattling the banking sector in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's failure.

Credit Suisse, one of a handful of global financial institutions deemed ""systemically important,"" posted a fourth-quarter loss of over $1 billion. Over the last few days, it has suffered mass outflows as problems mounted and bank sector concerns festered, pushing its stock to record lows.

What they're saying: “Given recent extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances, the announced merger represents the best available outcome,"" Axel P. Lehmann, Credit Suisse's chairman said in a statement.

""This has been an extremely challenging time for Credit Suisse and while the team has worked tirelessly to address many significant legacy issues and execute on its new strategy, we are forced to reach a solution today that provides a durable outcome,"" he added.

On Thursday, sources told Bloomberg the Swiss government may be trying to arrange a merger between UBS and Credit Suisse in a move the paper said was being resisted by both sides. Reuters reported Friday that Credit Suisse AG's CFO has called a Saturday meeting to explore possible options—including a sale, break up or winding down of any combination of the firm's operations.

Despite a $54 billion loan from the Swiss central bank this week, investors continue losing faith in the company. Credit Suisse shares slid nearly 7% on the day by Friday's close. Other financial institutions are reportedly distancing themselves from the firm, with Reuters reporting four major banks have limited their dealings with Credit Suisse and its securities.

For its part, the U.S. Treasury Department is reportedly reviewing the financial sector's exposure to the bank, according to Bloomberg.

The bank has spent the last few days trying to recover after its shares hit all-time lows Wednesday. Despite the liquidity infusion and vote of confidence from the Swiss National Bank, reports have surfaced of the firm exploring different options.

(ddp)

The Fed hiked rates by 25 basis points, taking the federal funds rate to a 4.75–5% range, but signaled that it is close to pausing the hiking cycle. In the Fed’s statement, the reference to “ongoing increases” in rates likely being appropriate—which has been in the statement since the Fed started raising rates a year ago—was removed in favor of “some additional policy firming may be appropriate.”

Updated economic projections showed that a majority of Fed policymakers (10 out of 18) still expect a further 25bps hike by the end of the year, leaving estimates of the terminal rate at similar levels to the December estimate.

With the potential that the Fed’s rate-hiking cycle could be finished, or at least paused, by the May FOMC meeting, yields declined. Two-year US Treasury yields fell 20bps and 10-year yields dropped 16bps.

Stocks sold off late in the session after US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a Senate appearance that the government “is not considering insuring all uninsured bank deposits.” However, in testimony last week, she hinted that all banks will be considered systemically important, so that uninsured deposits would be covered if a relatively small bank fails in the days ahead.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell made similar comments in his press conference, suggesting that all deposits are safe, while also refusing to make an explicit, blanket statement. It appears that Yellen and Powell are prepared to use their emergency powers to cover uninsured deposits at failed banks but are unable or unwilling to flat out state that all depositors will be protected.

History tells us that durable turning points for markets tend to arrive once investors begin to anticipate interest rate cuts and a trough in economic activity and corporate earnings. But the Fed’s actions and analysis of the economy suggest these conditions are not yet fully in place.

Fed rate cuts are not imminent. Futures markets have been pricing in rate cuts for later this year, but the Fed’s economic projections do not show rates falling until 2024. At the post-meeting press conference, Powell said, “Rate cuts this year are not our baseline expectation.” Another important point to note from the SEP is that GDP growth is projected to be only 0.4% year-over-year in 4Q23. Combined with the strong data already released so far this year, this implies, at best, that the quarter-over-quarter growth rate will be zero over the remainder of 2023. Further, they expect the unemployment rate to be 4.5% at the end of 2023, up from February's 3.6%. Given the current very high level of job openings, to have unemployment rise this much implies a pessimistic view on the economic outlook.

The Fed acknowledged that lending conditions may tighten further…Although the Fed’s policy statement said the US banking system is ""sound and resilient,"" it also noted that recent stress in the banking sector is ""likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.“ In his press conference, Powell also noted that credit conditions could help tighten policy sufficiently to bring down inflation.

…which will weigh on corporate earnings. Lending standards have been tightening since the second half of 2021. The Fed's latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey showed that a net 43.7% of banks are tightening standards for small firms and 44.8% for large firms. Based on the Fed’s view, this survey, which is correlated with earnings growth, looks set to deteriorate further.

We do not think that the US banking system has a widespread solvency issue, although some banks may raise additional capital and confidence remains fragile. Against this backdrop, and given the risks to growth, we prefer high grade and investment grade bonds, which should be more resilient in the event of a recession. We are more cautious on corporate high yield credit given deteriorating fundamentals and the risk of spillover from banking sector stress.

We also advise investors to diversify beyond US equities and growth stocks given the deteriorating outlook for earnings, high valuations, and risks arising from interest rate hikes. By contrast, we expect positive performance from emerging market equities, including China and Asian semiconductor stocks, and select European themes, including German equities.

The last-minute rescue of Credit Suisse may have prevented the current banking crisis from exploding, but it’s a raw deal for Switzerland.

Worries that Credit Suisse’s downfall would spark a broader banking meltdown left Swiss regulators with few good options. A tie-up with its larger rival, UBS (UBS), offered the best chance of restoring stability in the banking sector globally and in Switzerland, and protecting the Swiss economy in the near term.

But it leaves Switzerland exposed to a single massive financial institution, even as there is still huge uncertainty over how successful the mega merger will prove to be.

“One of the most established facts in academic research is that bank mergers hardly ever work,” said Arturo Bris, a professor of finance at Swiss business school IMD.

There are also concerns that the deal will lead to huge job losses in Switzerland and weaken competition in the country’s vital financial sector, which overall employs more than 5% of the national workforce, or nearly 212,000 people.

Taxpayers, meanwhile, are now on the hook for up to 9 billions Swiss francs ($9.8 billion) of future potential losses at UBS arising from certain Credit Suisse assets, provided those losses exceed 5 billion francs ($5.4 billion). The state has also explicitly guaranteed a 100 billion Swiss franc ($109 billion) lifeline to UBS, should it need it, although that would be repayable.

Switzerland’s Social Democratic party has already called for an investigation into what went wrong at Credit Suisse, arguing that the newly created “super-megabank” increases risks for the Swiss economy.

The demise of one of Switzerland’s oldest institutions has come as a shock to many of its citizens. Credit Suisse is “part of Switzerland’s identity,” said Hans Gersbach, a professor of macroeconomics at ETH university in Zurich. The bank “has been instrumental in the development of modern Switzerland.”

Its collapse has also tainted Switzerland’s reputation as a safe and stable global financial center, particularly after the government effectively stripped shareholders of voting rights to get the deal done.

Swiss authorities also wiped out some bondholders ahead of shareholders, upending the traditional hierarchy of losses in a bank failure and dealing another blow to the country’s reputation among investors.

“The repercussions for Switzerland are terrible,” said Bris of IMD. “For a start, the reputation of Switzerland has been damaged forever.”

That will benefit other wealth management centers, including Singapore, he told CNN. Singaporeans are “celebrating… because there is going to be a huge inflow of funds into other wealth management jurisdictions.”

Too big to fail?

At roughly $1.7 trillion, the combined assets of the new entity amount to double the size of Switzerland’s annual economic output. By deposits and loans to Swiss customers, UBS will now be bigger than the next two local banks combined.

With a roughly 30% market share in Swiss banking, “we see too much concentration risk and market share control,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note last week before the deal was done. They suggested that the combined entity would need to exit or IPO some businesses.

The problem with having one single large bank in a small economy is that if it faces a bank run or needs a bailout — which UBS did during the 2008 crisis — the government’s financial firepower may be insufficient.

At 333 billion francs ($363 billion), local deposits in the new entity equal 45% of GDP — an enormous amount even for a country with healthy public finances and low levels of debt.

On the other hand, UBS is in a much stronger financial position than it was during the 2008 crisis and it will be required to build up an even bigger financial buffer as a result of the deal. The Swiss financial regulator, FINMA, has said it will “very closely monitor the transaction and compliance with all requirements under supervisory law.”

UBS chairman Colm Kelleher underscored the health of UBS’s balance sheet Sunday at a press conference on the deal. “Having been chief financial officer [at Morgan Stanley] during the last global financial crisis, I’m well aware of the importance of a solid balance sheet. UBS will remain rock-solid,” he said.

Kelleher added that UBS would trim Credit Suisse’s investment bank “and align it with our conservative risk culture.”

Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said “the question of market concentration in Switzerland is something to address in future.” “30% [market share] is higher than you might ideally want but not so high that it’s a major problem.”

The deal has “surgically removed the most worrying part of [Switzerland’s] banking system,” leaving it stronger, Kenningham added.

Jobs and competition

The deal will have an adverse affect on jobs, though, likely adding to the 9,000 cuts that Credit Suisse already announced as part of an earlier turnaround plan.

For Switzerland, the threat is acute. The two banks collectively employ more than 37,000 people in the country, about 18% of the financial sector’s workforce, and there is bound to be overlap.

“The Credit Suisse branch in the city where I live is right in front of UBS’s, meaning one of the two will certainly close,” Bris of IMD wrote in a note Monday.

In a call with analysts Sunday night, UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said the bank would try to remove 8 billion francs ($8.9 billion) of costs a year by 2027, 6 billion francs ($6.5 billion) of which would come from reducing staff numbers.

“We are clearly cognizant of Swiss societal and economic factors. We will be considerate employers, but we need to do this in a rational way,” Kelleher told reporters.

Not only does the deal, done in a hurry, fail to protect jobs in Switzerland, but it contains no special provisions on competition issues.

UBS now has “quasi-monopoly power,” which could increase the cost of banking services in the country, according to Bris.

Although Switzerland has dozens of smaller regional and savings banks, including 24 cantonal banks, UBS is now an even more dominant player. “Everything they do… will influence the market,” said Gersbach of ETH.

Credit Suisse’s Swiss banking arm, arguably its crown jewel, could have been subject to a future sale as part of the terms of the deal, he added.

A spinoff of the domestic bank now looks unlikely, however, after UBS made clear that it intended to hold onto it. “The Credit Suisse Swiss bank is a fine asset that we are very determined to keep,” Kelleher said Sunday.

Integration is difficult

At $3.25 billion, UBS got Credit Suisse for 60% less than the bank was worth when markets closed two days prior. Whether that ultimately turns out to be a steal remains to be seen. Large mergers are notoriously fraught with risk and often don’t deliver the promised returns to shareholders.

UBS argues that by expanding its global wealth and asset management franchise, the deal will drive long-term shareholder value. “UBS’s strength and our familiarity with Credit Suisse’s business puts us in a unique position to execute this integration efficiently and effectively,” Kelleher said. UBS expects the deal to increase its profit by 2027.

The transaction is expected to close in the coming months, but fully integrating the two institutions will take three to five years, according to Phillip Straley, the president of data analytics company FNA. “There’s a huge amount of integration risk,” he said.

Moody’s on Tuesday affirmed its credit ratings on UBS but changed the outlook on some of its debt from stable to negative, judging that the “complexity, extent and duration of the integration” posed risks to the bank.

It pointed to challenges retaining key Credit Suisse staff, minimizing the loss of overlapping clients in Switzerland and unifying the cultures of “two somewhat different organizations.”

According to Kenningham of Capital Economics, the “track record of shotgun marriages in the banking sector is mixed.”

“Some, such as the 1995 purchase of Barings by ING, have proved long-lasting. But others, including several during the global financial crisis, soon brought into question the viability of the acquiring bank, while others have proven very difficult to implement.”",['Hanna Ziady'],2023-03-23 00:00:00

UBS plans to have more than 50% of its applications running in the Microsoft Azure cloud

Initiative will help UBS provide innovative products and services to clients, further empower employees and advance sustainability goals

UBS and Microsoft co-develop products and solutions to meet the digital needs of the bank and financial services industry

ZURICH and REDMOND, Wash. — Oct. 20, 2022 — On Thursday, UBS and Microsoft Corp. announced a landmark expansion of their partnership to accelerate UBS’s public cloud footprint over the next five years. Through this transformational initiative, UBS plans to have more than 50% of its applications, including critical workloads, running on Microsoft Azure, now UBS’s primary cloud platform. The partnership furthers UBS’s “cloud-first” strategy and the modernization of its global technology estate.

Through this partnership, UBS will have access to the most comprehensive cloud platform, trusted by more than 95% of Fortune 500 companies, with a rich set of productivity and collaboration tools, enabling the firm to increase the speed at which it can deliver and improve upon its digital experiences for clients and employees. At the same time, Azure will help advance UBS’s sustainability initiatives, drive operational efficiencies, and maintain its standards for compliance and security — providing strong foundations on which to scale UBS’s rate of cloud adoption.

“Our cloud strategy has fundamentally changed the way we operate, allowing us to reinvigorate our technology estate and reimagine how we build applications for our clients,” said Mike Dargan, UBS Group chief digital and information officer. “Closely partnering and collaborating with Microsoft has and will continue to create tremendous value for our clients, our employees, the firm and our shareholders. The developments and learnings that stem from this partnership will benefit the financial services industry and beyond.”

In 2018, when UBS announced its cloud strategy, leveraging its strategic partnership with Microsoft, it planned to move one-third of its applications to public cloud within four years, but accomplished this goal early in February 2021. Now, the partnership goes beyond just consuming cloud services to include the co-development of innovations and greater collaboration in areas like carbon reduction.

“UBS is a forward-thinking leader in the financial services industry, and Microsoft has been fortunate to co-develop innovative applications that meet complex, regulatory requirements with their engineering teams over the past several years,” said Scott Guthrie, executive vice president, Cloud + AI, Microsoft. “Our expanded partnership will continue to accelerate the organization’s ambitious digital transformation plans, applying the power of the Microsoft Cloud to equip UBS with the agility and reliability to deliver for their clients.”

Advancing digital sustainability

In line with the firm’s sustainability goals, UBS continues to move certain technology platform workloads from its on-premises and private cloud servers to Azure. In some use cases, this has resulted in the energy consumption of these workloads to be reduced by up to 30% to date.

Together, UBS and Microsoft also co-developed a Carbon Aware API, an open-source solution that provides recommendations on how to schedule workloads that require heavy compute power during times when clean, renewable or low-carbon sources of electricity are most available. They then provided their solution to the Green Software Foundation so it could be shared with large and small companies around the world.

Enhancing client and employee experiences with artificial intelligence

UBS and Microsoft are implementing and further exploring ways in which artificial intelligence and data can be used to enhance services for clients and employees. For example, in Switzerland, UBS is currently operating two applications that utilize conversational AI capabilities to respond to client e-mail inquiries.

Unleashing innovation and driving greater business insights on a trusted platform

To support UBS’s “cloud-first” strategy and further drive innovation, Microsoft actively brought its Azure confidential computing services to Switzerland. This provided UBS with a new functionality to protect and secure data sharing internally across all of UBS’s business divisions, while maintaining the bank’s compliance and security standards. As a result, UBS can now develop additional business insights and uncover new opportunities for innovation for its clients and employees.

In addition, UBS will leverage Microsoft Power Platform — including Power Apps and Power Automate — which will provide employees with the ability to quickly build professional-grade applications, create automated workflows and connect disparate data sources.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo















ZURICH, Jan 31 (Reuters) - UBS (UBSG.S), Switzerland's biggest bank, forecast an uncertain year ahead due to the war in Ukraine and sagging client confidence on Tuesday, despite trumping expectations for 2022 with a $7.6 billion net profit.

The world's largest wealth manager kicked off a round of business results for Europe's banks, after Wall Street embarked on job cutting in the face of fading economic growth.

Shares in UBS slipped close to 4% after it cautioned that inflation and the war in Ukraine were clouding the future, dampening the mood among its wealthy clients. It said that lower asset prices and weaker confidence could affect its business, although it would also gain from higher interest rates.

The Zurich-based bank reported a 23% rise in net profit attributable to shareholders of $1.7 billion for the quarter just ended, helped by a fall in costs, despite a drop in financial markets. That compared with the $1.3 billion average of 21 analyst estimates in a UBS-conducted poll.

Full-year net profit reached $7.6 billion, compared with the consensus estimate of $7.3 billion.

A fall in income from fees and commissions linked to lower client activity was partly offset by a rise in net interest income, including a 35% gain in global wealth management.

""While the macroeconomic outlook remains uncertain, our operational resilience ... put us in a great position to serve our clients, fund growth and deliver strong capital returns,"" UBS Chief Executive Ralph Hamers said.

""We are starting 2023 from a position of strength"".

Analysts gave the results a lukewarm welcome. Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Michael Klien said UBS had benefited from one-offs, including a lower than expected tax rate. Jefferies analysts said the same, describing the results as 'mixed'.

Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), the bank's cross-town rival, will report on Feb. 9 having flagged a quarterly pre-tax loss of as much as 1.5 billion francs ($1.6 billion) after hefty client withdrawals in the wake of a string of scandals and losses.

SLOWDOWN

UBS said it gained $23.3 billion in net new fee generating assets in wealth management, with a strong Swiss performance.

The bank's home turf saw net new deposits of $8 billion in the fourth quarter from corporate clients and global wealth management, compared with $9 billion for the full year.

As expected, investment banking was hit hard, with revenues in its global banking division, which advises on M&A deals and IPOs, driven down 52% by lower capital markets revenues.

But revenues in the investment bank's global markets tumbled 11%, which was more than analysts had predicted, due to lower income from services linked to derivatives and solutions, as well as execution services.

UBS made its guarded prediction for the future, shortly after Germany announced that its economy, Europe's largest, had unexpectedly shrank in the fourth quarter.

The International Monetary Fund has predicted that the U.S. economic output will grow at a steady but slower pace than in 2022, while euro zone countries would grow only modestly and Britain would enter a recession.

UBS announced plans to buy back more than $5 billion worth of shares this year after repurchasing $5.5 billion in 2022.

It has also proposed a dividend hike to $0.55 per share for last year from $0.51 for 2021.

https://menafn.com/1105985472/Heated-Debates-In-Parliament-Over-UBS-Credit-Suisse-Bailout,Heated Debates In Parliament Over UBS-Credit Suisse Bailout,"The Swiss Senate, meeting in an extraordinary session, has approved government credits granted as part of last month's UBS-Credit Suisse merger. The House of Representatives is expected to vote later in the evening.

The Senate backed the CHF109 billion ($120 billion) government credits on Tuesday by 29 votes to six, with seven abstentions. At the same time it called on the government to answer a long list of questions about the deal and its consequences. The government has already promised a full report to parliament within 12 months.

This is only the third extraordinary parliamentary session in more than two decades – after one on the collapse of Swissair and one on measures to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. Many politicians are angry that parliament was not consulted on the deal to save ailing Credit Suisse and the government credits granted as part of the package.

Parliament cannot block the deal, which was done under emergency legislation with approval from the six-member parliamentary finance delegation, but it can impose conditions notably on how the CHF109 billion is used. The Green Party, for example, wants guarantees on climate sustainability, and there have been calls for limits on bank managers' salaries and bonuses.

Interior Minister Alain Berset, who holds the rotating Swiss presidency this year, opened the session with a defence of the emergency deal, telling parliamentarians that the clock was ticking and“the government was forced to act, in the interest of the country, the institutions and the national economy”. He said confidence in Credit Suisse had not disappeared overnight but had been eroded for years by directors who had not learned the lessons of the previous financial crisis.

Indeed, Credit Suisse managers came in for some harsh criticism. In their greed for more profit they had ignored risks, Peter Hegglin of the Centre Party told the session. Social Democrat Eva Herzog said the 2008 financial crisis had not been enough to make the“Wolf of Wall Street” type of banker disappear. She and other politicians called for liability suits and claims for damages.

The ""Minsky moment,"" named after the economist Hyman Minsky, is a sudden collapse of the market after a long period of aggressive speculation brought on by easy money. Markets might face a Minsky moment soon, warned Marko Kolanovic, JPMorgan Chase's chief market strategist and co-head of global research.

Markets haven't collapsed. Some bank stocks are in the doldrums, yes, but the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF, a fund of regional bank stocks, rose 1.11% on Monday. Major indexes were up yesterday too. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2%, the S&P 500 added 0.89% and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.39%.

But there are signs market instability is increasing. The banking crisis is causing regional banks — which account for around a third of all lending in the United States — to reduce their loans, said Eric Diton, president and managing director of The Wealth Alliance. In other words, the availability of money in the economy is slowing even without the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates.

Speaking of interest rates, analysts seem to think there's no good path forward for the Fed. An interest rate hike ""would be a mistake,"" MKM Partners Chief Economist Michael Darda told CNBC. On the other hand, a pause would cause ""panicked reactions by equity and bond investors,"" according to Nationwide's Mark Hackett. This suggests markets are already so jittery that whatever the Fed does — even if it's nothing — it might cause instability to spread.

With that in mind, investors might want to heed Kolanovic's warning that a Minsky moment could be on the horizon.

Big U.S. banks may also be winners, analysts say","UBS ' acquisition of Credit Suisse could lead to big gains for the Swiss bank. Some banks in the U.S. could also benefit from it, according to analysts. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs, or around $3.2 billion, in a forced deal announced Sunday. The Swiss National Bank pledged to lend up to 100 billion Swiss francs, or $108 billion, to support the takeover, while the Swiss government also guaranteed it would assume losses up to 9 billion Swiss francs from certain assets over a preset time period to reduce risks to UBS. The deal has left Wall Street to figure out how the marriage of two globally important financial giants will reverberate throughout a global industry that's already on uneasy footing coming off the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. For UBS shareholders, Bank of America analyst Alastair Ryan said, the deal could be good long term. He upgraded UBS' U.S.-listed shares to buy from neutral, citing potential cost synergies by combining two Switzerland-centric banks. Ryan also increased his price target to $24.81 from $22.65. His new target implies the stock could rally 36.3%. ""The industrial logic is impeccable: CS was the closest competitor to UBS in wealth management and Switzerland; and both banks are heavy in Swiss central costs,"" he said in a Monday note to clients. As part of the deal, Credit Suisse shareholders receive 1 UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares they hold. While Jefferies analyst Flora Bocahut said the deal itself could be beneficial for shareholders on paper, the onus is now on UBS to execute. Still, she called the deal positive considering alternatives included a nationalization or unwinding of Credit Suisse that would have increased risks to the broader sector. ""We think the objective of this transaction, while solving CS' situation & associated risks for the system, is to reach a win/win, where UBS shareholders also get value out of this deal over time,"" she said in a note to clients Sunday. ""However, UBS embarks significant execution risk, litigation risk, the buyback is temporarily suspended (unclear how long), UBS' capital requirement is likely to be revised up, and management focus will be captured by this deal for many quarters, maybe years."" 'Goliath is winning' Others are questioning how the broader industry will fare — and have varied outlooks. Goldman Sachs chief credit strategist Lotfi Karoui moved his view of European banks back to overweight following the deal in a Sunday note to clients. ""On Friday, we argued that the performance of the broader European banking sector would remain pressured until clarity is provided on Credit Suisse's future path and recommended moving to a neutral allocation on banks in the EUR market (from overweight previously),"" Karoui said. ""Today's outcome provides such clarity."" Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs chief European economist Sven Jari Stehn said the bank crisis has made the firm expect the European Central Bank to hike interest rates by 25 basis points in May compared with a 50 basis-point increase expected before the financial sector challenges began. While the firm expects the Bank of England to hike rates by 25 basis points at its next meeting, Stehn said to no longer expect another interest rate increase in May. But Barclays analyst Amit Goel wasn't so sure, cutting his view on European banks to neutral from positive on Monday. Goel said he's more optimistic on banks in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and the Netherlands compared with Switzerland, with preferred global equities including BNP Paribas, ABN AMRO Bank, HSBC and Lloyds Bank . ""Recent events again go to show how fragile the banking system can be, even though regulation has increased several fold since the Global Financial Crisis,"" Goel said. ""Following recent events we expect broader sector cost of equity to remain elevated for some time, and liquidity requirements to be revisited."" Within the U.S., investors are continuing to weigh the risk of contagion within the sector, specifically watching regional banks. First Republic Bank lost more than 70% of its share value last week despite a group of banks saying it would aid First Republic with $30 billion in deposits. Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala said stock prices could stabilize if investors gain confidence that the deposit flight out of regional banks has been contained. Elsewhere, Poonawala noted investors will be watching the Federal Reserve policy meeting this week to see if the central bank goes through with an expected interest rate hike of 25 basis points. Wells Fargo's Mike Mayo, meanwhile, sees opportunity for U.S. banks coming out of the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse. Calling the deal proof that ""Goliath is winning,"" he said U.S. banks may have an opening with the deal not slated to close until the end of the year. ""To us, this merger further displays that the largest U.S. capital players can continue to gain global market share, as they've done for the past decade,"" Mayo said. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",['Alex Harring'],2023-03-20 00:00:00
