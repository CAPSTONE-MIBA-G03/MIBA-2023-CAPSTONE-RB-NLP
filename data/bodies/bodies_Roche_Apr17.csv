However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Roche Holding's ROE today.

Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.

See our latest analysis for Roche Holding

How To Calculate Return On Equity?

The formula for return on equity is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Roche Holding is:

42% = CHF14b ÷ CHF32b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).

The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every CHF1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn CHF0.42 in profit.

Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?

So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.

Roche Holding's Earnings Growth And 42% ROE

First thing first, we like that Roche Holding has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 9.2% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This likely paved the way for the modest 7.6% net income growth seen by Roche Holding over the past five years. growth

Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Roche Holding's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 12% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.

The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is ROG fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value has everything you need to know.

Is Roche Holding Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?

While Roche Holding has a three-year median payout ratio of 56% (which means it retains 44% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.

Moreover, Roche Holding is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 44% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the lower expected payout ratio.

Conclusion

On the whole, we do feel that Roche Holding has some positive attributes. The company has grown its earnings moderately as previously discussed. Still, the high ROE could have been even more beneficial to investors had the company been reinvesting more of its profits. As highlighted earlier, the current reinvestment rate appears to be quite low. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

In the first-ever positive Phase III trial in the adjuvant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) setting, Tecentriq plus Avastin reduced the risk of disease recurrence by 28% 1

Up to 80% of people with this type of HCC experience disease recurrence, at which point they are faced with poorer prognosis and shorter survival 2

These data will be presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2023 and included in the official press programme





Basel, 16 April 2023 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today new data from the Phase III IMbrave050 study that show Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) plus Avastin® (bevacizumab) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in recurrence-free survival (RFS) in people with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at high risk of disease recurrence following liver resection or ablation with curative intent.2

“Four out of five people with HCC who receive surgery with curative intent may still see their cancer return. Thus, an urgent need exists for adjuvant treatments to prevent early recurrence and improve survival rates,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “With Tecentriq plus Avastin already a standard of care in unresectable HCC, we are pleased with the potential of these results and look forward to seeing more mature data.”

The Tecentriq investigational combination reduced the risk of cancer returning by 28%, compared with active surveillance, at a median follow-up of 17.4 months (independent review facility [IRF]-RFS hazard ratio [HR]=0.72, 95% CI: 0.56-0.93; P=0.0120).1 The IRF-RFS findings were generally consistent across clinical subgroups. Overall Survival (OS), a key secondary endpoint, was immature (7% event-rate) at the time of data analysis. The safety data for Tecentriq plus Avastin were consistent with the well-established safety profile of each therapeutic treatment and with the underlying disease.1

Story continues

The late-breaking data will be presented at the AACR Annual Meeting 2023 and have been included as part of the official press programme. Discussions with health authorities are ongoing and follow-up will continue for the final RFS data and more mature OS data at the next planned analysis.

The IMbrave050 study is part of Roche’s overall commitment to drive fundamental treatment change and improve outcomes for people living with liver cancer. Tecentriq plus Avastin was the first treatment in over a decade to significantly improve OS over the existing standard of care, based on data from the IMbrave150 study.3 The Tecentriq combination quickly became a standard of care in unresectable HCC and is clearly defined as a preferred front-line treatment in multiple international clinical guidelines.

About the IMbrave050 study

IMbrave050 is a Phase III global, multicentre, open-label, randomised study evaluating the efficacy and safety of adjuvant Tecentriq plus Avastin, compared with active surveillance, in people with HCC at high risk of recurrence (determined by the size and number of cancerous lesions and the histopathology results, if available) after surgical resection or ablation with curative intent.

The study randomised 668 people with a ratio of 1:1 to receive either Tecentriq (1,200 mg every three weeks) plus Avastin (15 mg/kg every three weeks) for a period of 12 months or 17 cycles, or no intervention with active surveillance. The primary endpoint is independent review facility-assessed RFS. Key secondary endpoints include OS, RFS as determined by the investigator and RFS in patients with PD-L1-positive disease.

About hepatocellular carcinoma

Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death and one of the few cancers where mortality is rising.4,5 More than 900,000 people are diagnosed with the disease globally each year, which translates to one person diagnosed every 90 seconds.4 Nine out of ten cases of HCC are caused by chronic liver disease, which includes chronic hepatitis B and C infection, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) and cirrhosis resulting from these conditions.5,6

If diagnosed in the early stage, surgery may be prescribed to remove the primary tumour, however an estimated 70-80% of people with early-stage HCC experience disease recurrence following surgery.2 Early recurrence is associated with poorer prognosis and shorter survival.2,7 Tumour size, number of tumours, and portal vein invasion are associated with an increased risk of recurrence.7

About Tecentriq

Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy approved for some of the most aggressive and difficult-to-treat forms of cancer. Tecentriq was the first cancer immunotherapy approved for the treatment of a certain type of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and HCC. Tecentriq is also approved in countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies, for various forms of metastatic NSCLC, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer, PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma.

Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. In addition to intravenous infusion, the formulation of Tecentriq is also being investigated as a subcutaneous injection to help address the growing burden of cancer treatment for patients and healthcare systems.

Ben Healy, 22, emulated the great Stephen Roche from 1982 and became just the third Irish rider in history to claim a podium finish by finishing second in the Amstel Gold Race on Sunday.

The result follows several electrifying performances this season, and Sunday's performance served as further evidence that the EF Education-EasyPost rider has attained the pinnacle of the sport.

After eliminating a number of sports greats, including Olympic Champion and British phenomenon Tom Pidcock in the final 10 kilometers.

Healy was only 40 seconds behind world number one and two-time Tour de France champion Tadej Pogacar. (UAE Team Emirates)

“I knew I had good legs, and I knew I had to ride a smart race as well to finish second today,” Healy said after the race.

“That’s what I did, and it paid off for me in the end.

“I was quietly confident. I rode a very aggressive race at Brabantse and I knew with a few bigger names here I would get the luxury of maybe missing few turns, which is what I did. It played to my advantage in the end.”

https://pharmaphorum.com/news/roche-launches-its-decision-making-algorithm-marketplace,Roche launches its decision-making algorithm marketplace,"In a further sign of pharma embracing digital technologies, Roche has launched a library of medical algorithms designed to make clinical decision-making faster and more tailored to patients.

The navify suite is a marketplace-like platform that offers clinicians access to various algorithms developed by Roche or its partners, starting off with algorithms aimed at identifying patients who are at risk of developing certain cancers.

Roche pulled its portfolio of more than 30 digital health offerings for infrastructure, operations, clinical decision support, and screening tools together last year under the navify brand, promising that the software would help improve operational processes and clinical decision making in healthcare.

Moritz Hartmann, Roche

At the time, Moritz Hartmann – global head of information solutions at Roche Diagnostics – explained that the objective is to create an open digital ecosystem with labs, hospitals, and medtech companies to bring the latest innovations faster to society.

“As healthcare data is set to grow annually by 36%, digital medical algorithms can generate actionable insights, which physicians can use to start delivering on the promise of personalised healthcare,” said Hartmann.

“With navify Algorithm Suite, clinicians can easily order the medical algorithms they need from Roche and other providers, to get enhanced insights that improve patient care,” he added.

The company cites data that estimates that limited ability to connect and share data in the US healthcare system results in costs of around $30 billion a year, and will be exacerbated by a shortage of healthcare workers predicted to reach 15 million worldwide by 2030.

The navify suite will make it easier for physicians to use and adopt medical algorithms, and give universities and other providers of digital algorithms a direct channel to distribute their software.

The first algorithms to be included are focused on cancer, and include GAAD, which has been developed to assist in the diagnosis of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) – the most common form of liver cancer – in patients with chronic liver disease.

Also in the initial range is the ColonFlag algorithm from the Medial EarlySign company, which helps identify patients at high-risk for colon cancer by analysing age, sex, and a recent complete blood count.

Additional medical algorithms for oncology, cardiology, and other diseases, such as lung and infectious diseases, are in the pipeline, said Roche.

The new navify ecosystem will be showcased by Roche at the forthcoming Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) annual conference in Chicago on 17th to 21st April. It is currently available in Europe and Asia-Pacific.",[],
https://www.archpaper.com/2023/04/archive-yale-university-new-website-continue-legacy-architect-kevin-roche/,An archive at Yale University continues legacy of Kevin Roche,"Yale University Library’s Manuscripts and Archives has acquired an archive of the career of architect Kevin Roche. Roche’s family has donated correspondence, project documentation, interviews, drawings, and photographs from the architectural firm of Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates (KRJDA) to cement the architect’s legacy. In addition to the archive at Yale, a legacy website for KRJDA has also launched.

Work on the archival project started in 2007. Robert A.M. Stern, then dean of the Yale School of Architecture, supported the project from the beginning. “The Kevin Roche archive is one of the most important resources for the study and appreciation of post-war architecture,” he noted in a press release “International in scope and brilliantly occupying the crossroads of corporate post-modernism, it documents the work of a major talent.”

Roche, who was born in Ireland, launched his architectural career working in the Michigan office of Eero Saarinen after Saarinen passed away in 1961. Roche moved east, then founded and led his own firm alongside John Dinkeloo, and completed many of Saarinen’s designs, among this the St. Louis Gateway Arch and the TWA Terminal at JFK Airport. Roche went on to win the Pritzker Prize in 1982. In 2021, following Roche’s death in 2019, the firm rebranded as Roche Modern and continues to operate from an office in Connecticut under the direction of Jerry Boryca and Eamon Roche, Kevin’s oldest son.

The archive includes 789 boxes of Roche’s personal and professional correspondence along with 954 drawing tubes, 64,000 4×5 transparencies, and over 88,000 35mm slides. Archivist Linda Scinto has been responsible for sifting through the materials and objects, cataloging, packaging, and transferring them. Scinto began working at KRJDA in 1997 as an interior designer and worked as Roche’s executive assistant from 2011 to 2019.

“It was an honor to be chosen by Kevin Roche to be the lead archivist on such a monumental project and I am delighted that people will be able to study the collection today and in the future,” Scinto said in a statement.

Among the items in the collection are drawings and plans for several corporate headquarters designed by KRJDA, including the Ford Foundation, Cummins, and ConocoPhillips, as well as a number of museum renovation projects, theaters, and university buildings.

Items in the archive are listed online by project name. They are physically stored at Yale University’s archive locations.)

In addition to the archive at Yale, the Roche family has also produced an archival website that highlights the history of the firm, the people who shaped it, and information on putting together the archive. It also showcases KRJDA’s portfolio with project imagery and building models.

“Speaking on behalf of my siblings we are delighted to have been able to fulfill our father’s commitment to form this comprehensive archive of KRJDA’s mid to late 20th Century architecture. We are so grateful for Bob Stern’s instigation of the effort in the first place, to Yale for their partnership and of course for the fifteen years of documentation and cataloging put forward by the team at KRJDA,” Eamon Roche said.

The completed archive and the new website follow an announcement last year that the architect’s family would reallocate the money received from Roche’s Pritzker Prize award to launch a scholarship program in the name of Roche and his wife Jane, who he met while working for Saarinen.",['Kristine Klein'],2023-04-12 20:25:07+00:00

Photo: Getty

Irish national time trial champion Ben Healy continued his superb run of early-season form when he finished second at the prestigious Amstel Gold Race in the Netherlands.

Healy matched the best Irish result in the Dutch one-day Classic 41 years after Stephen Roche finished second behind five-time home winner Jan Raas. The 22-year-old Healy finished behind two-time Tour de France winner Tadej Pogacar (UAE Emirates) after spending much of the 253km-long race in the front group.

Healy, who also finished second in Belgian Classic Brabantse Pijl on Wednesday, was part of a 16-strong group that went clear at the front with about 100km of racing remaining.

“At that point we still had Neilson (Powless) behind,” Healy told Independent.ie. “He was our main leader for the team, so I kind of got a free ride. I was still rolling through but not really pulling hard turns which definitely helped me in the finale.

“Then, as we got closer to the finish, it was a super attritional race. A lot of guys were hurting in that break. You really had to race carefully today, because an important move could happen at any time. Those kind of circumstances suit me well but I think other riders had more trouble with that.""

Of that front group, only Healy and British rider Tom Pidcock (Ineos Grenadiers) were able to follow an attack by Pogacar on the climb of the Eyserbosweg with 36km to go.

Pogacar, who has taken three stage victories and the overall at both Paris-Nice and the Vuelta a Andalucia this year as well as the cobbled Belgian Monument the Tour of Flanders, shrugged off an earlier bike change to drive open a gap to the chasers before simply riding his fellow escapees off his wheel on the climb of the Kautenberg with 28km to go.

twitter

Although Healy lost contact first, the EF Education-Easypost pro managed to claw his way back up to Pidcock and the duo put in a concerted chase before Healy attacked his former Trinity Racing team-mate with 14km to go.

“We kept working pretty well together, but the first time up the Cauberg I could just feel that his legs were hurting so I gave it a dig on the next climb,” said Healy, whose strong time-trialling skills saw him close to within 20 seconds of Pogacar at one point before growing out to 38 seconds by the line, where a very impressive Healy finished a minute and a half clear of Pidcock to claim the second step on the podium.

“I had a bit of a ride to the finish but it was good,” said the 22-year-old. “I think that dig closed the gap a bit but as soon as Pogacar heard the gap was coming down he clearly had more in reserve and pulled away again. The legs were good today so it was nice to prove to myself that I can do it in good company. Second to the best in the world, I can’t be unhappy with that.”

With two victories already under his belt and two white jerseys for best young rider at the Tour de Pays Loire and the Coppi e Bartali stage races respectively, it’s been a breakout season for Healy, who tackles Fleche-Wallonne on Wednesday and Liege-Bastogne-Liege on Sunday.

“I really took a step up this year, which is great. The legs were very good again today and I hope to continue this run of form.”

Healy’s podium placing capped a great weekend for young Irish riders as Darren Rafferty took fifth place in the U-23 Liege-Bastogne-Liege classic on Saturday, just days after finishing in the same position at the prestigious Giro del Belvedere U-23 race. Meanwhile, Offaly rider Megan Armitage finished fourth at the Grand Prix Feminin de Chambery.

https://news.yahoo.com/cheyenne-roche-look-bright-side-194600102.html,Cheyenne Roche: Look on the bright side,"Apr. 13—I start each work day by filling out my planner. I like a daily planner with a big spot for my to-do list — none of that hour by hour stuff. Finally this year I caved and bought a custom planner.

I have a spot for the stories I'm going to run that day, my interviews and meetings, my meals, a daily Bible verse and a spot for my daily gratitude.

The Mayo Clinic Health System says expressing gratitude is associated with a host of mental and physical benefits. Studies have shown feeling thankful can improve sleep, mood and immunity. Gratitude can decrease depression, anxiety, difficulties with chronic pain and risk of disease.

Some days I write multiple things I'm grateful for, and others I stare at the blank section, struggling. I don't look for anything too big or profound. Today I'm grateful for yesterday's sunshine and my first outing in shorts this season.

I'm often grateful for my husband, a clean house or a good book. It helps me start my day with a burst of positivity.

Consistently utilizing this practice has helped me put things into perspective.

I've always had a hard time with people quick to complain. I think it's largely due to the pressure I put on myself to make others happy. When other people complain, I blame myself for the situation. That being said, I've noticed an increase in complaints here lately that have nothing to do with me.

Probably the most confounding complaining I've heard recently surrounds the new business — Creston Liquor, preparing to open next month. Many of the comments say Creston doesn't need another place selling alcohol. Others say we should be focusing on things for kids and teenagers to do rather than something like this.

That space has sat empty since 2020 when Hibbett Sports went out of business. Someone who already owns liquor stores made the choice to set up shop in our community and give that space meaning.

If you don't like alcohol, don't shop there. If you want to support Hy-Vee or Casey's or wherever else to buy your alcohol, do that. There's just no need for complaining about someone bringing business to town.

Story continues

I for one, hope he stocks Ole Smoky's cookie dough whiskey. The closest place to get it is in Minneapolis or Madison.

As far as the comments about more things in our community for children — it shouldn't be some guy from Des Moines' responsibility to ensure Creston has enough for kids to do.

That's our job. Any one of us in the community could take the initiative to start something additional, but no one has.

In addition to those complaints, I've seen a deluge of upset comments surrounding food trucks, rental inspections and property assessments. But let's just talk about the last one.

Properties had not been appraised, in some cases, for an exorbitant number of years. That isn't the property owner's fault, but realistically, many should have been paying more in taxes for the last several years. The fact it's just now going up should be considered a blessing for some people.

Yeah, I get it — no one wants to pay more. No one wants taxes to go up. But if you make your house worth more money or if your house is simply worth more due to the nature of the real estate market, you will have to pay more. End of story.

The Iowa Department of Revenue states all real property is assessed every odd-numbered year. Residential, commercial, industrial and state assessed properties are to be valued at actual value or market value.

Ask yourself if your property has been assessed every odd-numbered year? If not and your taxes went up this year, you've saved money. Let the people do their jobs.

We did nothing to our home and our valuation went up $30,000 from when we bought it in 2019. It's the nature of the economy.

If you find yourself worked up over one of these topics, take a minute. Think about the things in your life you are grateful for. Think of your loved ones and the sun in the sky and the money in your bank account.

If a new business coming to Creston is the worst thing happening in your life, I'd say you've got a lot to be grateful for.","['Cheyenne Roche', 'The Creston News Advertiser']",

The 30-year-old athlete’s absence from the lineup during the recent Pan Am Aquatics Championships in Bauru, Brazil was not a signal she was winding down her international career.

Instead, the Grant Park High School grad is taking time to recuperate following surgery 13 days ago to repair an injured left shoulder.

“It’s my left shoulder — people think, ‘Oh, you’re not throwing with it,’ but we’re doing so much. We’re swimming, pushing, pulling and being pulled,” said La Roche from her home base in Laval, Que., earlier this week. “I kind of battled the injury for a while and then it just got to the point where it clearly needed surgery…

“It’ll be a good three, four months recovery, but then I’ll actually be really good to go for an Olympic year.”

Shoulder and hip injuries tend to be the most common long-term ailments in the sport. National team head coach David Parelda suggested a careful approach to La Roche’s rehabilitation process.

“She’s a great athlete and she’s been dealing with a lot of injuries before and she’s always been very professional about about it,” Paradelo said Friday from a training camp in Rome. “She’s a veteran and basically the success of her surgery and the recovery following through will pretty much dictate (her return). There’s been some different shoulder injuries on the team in the past (quadrennial) and they’ve all recovered very professionally and are back to play.

“This surgery has a six-month period without playing and if things go according to plan, I think she’ll be ready for that time.”

The 5-5 left wing is confident she will be in top form before long.

“It’s totally doable and actually it’s nice that it’s is my left (shoulder), not my right so I don’t have to learn to re-throw,” said La Roche. “I’m using it a lot but it’s not really the same as your dominant arm and luckily, like through rehab, I have my dominant arm to do everything. It was more of a decision just so that I would be able to play. The surgery wouldn’t have been as necessary if I didn’t want to be an athlete.”

The worlds in Fukuoka will be the first opportunity for the Canadian women to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics with a subsequent opportunity to qualify at the Pan Am Games, scheduled for Oct. 20-Nov. 5 in Santiago, Chile.

“The top two teams (from Kukuoka) are qualified for the Olympics,” said Paradelo. “Of course, our hope is that this happens sooner than later. It will be a tough one, but it’s feasible.”

La Roche and the Canadian team finished seventh at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 while placing ninth at the 2022 worlds in Hungary.

Since graduating from Indiana University in 2014, she’s lived full time in Laval to be close to the national team training site in Montreal, with the exception of time spent with SIS Roma in the Italian pro league.

La Roche did not consider opting for retirement instead of surgery.

“There was never really a thought of retiring (this year),” said La Roche. “Because the plan is to retire after these Olympics. But even after that I want to be able to play club with my friends and my husband plays and I don’t want to have to stop water polo and never use my shoulder again.”

Ben Healy continued what has been a superb season on Sunday, finishing second to world number one Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates) in the Amstel Gold Race. The 22-year-old has had a breakthrough second season as a professional, winning two races in March, finishing second last weekend in the Brabantse Pijl event and reaching a new level again in Sunday’s prestigious Classic.

He finished 38 seconds behind Pogačar, his second place the joint-best Irish result ever in the race. It equalled Stephen Roche’s runner-up slot from 1982 and bettered Seán Kelly’s third place two years earlier.

“I knew I had good legs, and I knew I had to ride a smart race as well to finish second today,” he said afterwards. “That’s what I did, and it paid off for me in the end.

“I was quietly confident. I rode a very aggressive race at Brabantse and I knew with a few bigger names here I would get the luxury of maybe missing few turns, which is what I did. It played to my advantage in the end.”

Ben. Healy. Remember the name. 💚🤍🧡



An amazing ride by our Irishman who took second at the Amstel Gold Race and made it back to back podium finishes this week. He put on a show today with the greats in the sport. Watch out for our Irish powerhouse. 😤 pic.twitter.com/qN1ZW4NJjK — EF Pro Cycling (@EFprocycling) April 16, 2023

Healy was part of a large breakaway group which moved clear 90 kilometres from the end, and remained prominent when Pogačar thinned things down to 11 riders on the first ascent of the Cauberg climb. The Slovenian surged again on the Eyserbosweg with 36km remaining, whittling things down to three out front. Healy found himself alongside the double Tour de France winner and last year’s Alpe d’Huez Tour stage victor Pidcock.

“It is pretty surreal,” he said. “You are racing with a couple of the best riders in the world. When you are able to follow them, you are like, ‘wow, the legs must be good today.’ Then when I dropped Tom as well, it was a pretty surreal moment.”

Pogačar made his move on the Keutenberg climb with 28.7km to go, beginning a solo run to the line. Healy was initially distanced but rejoined Pidcock and then shed the Briton on the Geulhemmerberg with just over 13km remaining.

He reduced Pogačar’s advantage to just 20 seconds before the time difference went out again. Pogačar was controversially aided by a lead car which was far too close on more than one occasion, giving him a slipstreaming advantage.

Healy will next be in action in Flèche Wallonne on Wednesday and then the prestigious Liège-Bastogne-Liège next Sunday.

Meanwhile, Megan Armitage had a superb performance in the Grand Prix de Chambéry in France on Sunday, finishing fourth in the 1.1-ranked event. She was one minute and seven seconds behind the French winner Victorie Guilman (FDJ-Suez), making participation in July’s Tour de France Femmes all the more likely.

On Saturday, Darren Rafferty also impressed, netting fifth in the under-23 Liège-Bastogne-Liège. Seth Dunwoody (Cannibal-Victorious U19 Development Team) won stage one of the 2.1-ranked Penn Ar Bed-Pays d’Iroise junior event, with Patrick Casey (Anexo Group Race Team) in sixth.","['Shane Stokes', 'Sun Apr -']",2023-04-16 00:00:00

ROTKREUZ, Switzerland, April 11, 2023 (PR Newswire Europe via COMTEX) -- At the global HIMSS1 Conference, Roche showcases navify Algorithm Suite, a single platform offering clinicians access to medical algorithms generating insights to help improve care decisions.

navify Algorithm Suite is a secure digital ecosystem that links physicians easily to a range of medical algorithms from Roche and its innovation partners without the hurdle of integrating multiple algorithm providers.

First available medical algorithms focus on identifying patients at risk for some liver and colon cancers. Medical algorithms for cardiac, lung and other disease states are in the pipeline.

ROTKREUZ, Switzerland, April 11, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) introduces its navify(R) Algorithm Suite, a single platform hosting a library of digital medical algorithms that generate patient-centric insights and can aid earlier diagnosis of cancer and other conditions per intended use, at the HIMSS Global Conference in Chicago, USA, from April 17- 21, 2023.

Physicians use medical algorithms, evidence-based decision-making tools, in the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients to optimise care, increase early diagnosis and adhere to guidelines. Use of real-time clinical decision support is associated with adherence to evidence-based guidelines and as an aid in screening of colorectal cancer.2,3

""As healthcare data is set to grow,4 digital medical algorithms can generate actionable insights which physicians can use to start delivering on the promise of personalised healthcare,"" said Moritz Hartmann, Global Head of Roche Information Solutions at Roche Diagnostics. ""With navify Algorithm Suite, clinicians can easily order the medical algorithms they need from Roche and other providers to get enhanced insights that improve patient care.""

navify Algorithm Suite offers labs and hospitals one platform to connect easily to digital medical algorithms from a diverse range of innovators. This makes it easier for physicians to use and adopt the medical algorithms they need. Simultaneously, navify Algorithm Suite also offers universities and other providers of digital algorithms a direct channel to distribute their proven innovations to practising physicians in markets worldwide.

The platform is designed to be embedded in existing healthcare workflows and the lab or hospital information system (LIS/HIS) and/or the EHR/EMR (electronic health/medical record). Designed for optimal information security management, navify Algorithm Suite complies with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) regulations in Europe as well as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability) in the USA.

The first algorithms inthe navify Algorithm Suite focus on oncology:

GAAD5 is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of early stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic liver disease. GAAD (an in-vitro diagnostic multivariate index assay) analyses gender, age in combination with results of two Roche assays Elecsys AFP and Elecsys PIVKA. This CE-marked algorithm6 may help physicians diagnose early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide7 and HCC is the most common form of liver cancer accounting for ~90% of cases.8 It is not available in the US.

A pre-screening algorithm to identify at-risk healthy people for colorectal cancer. The ColonFlag algorithm from the Medial EarlySign company helps identify patients at high-risk for colon cancer by analysing age, sex, and a recent complete blood count (CBC).9 Colorectal cancer is the 3rd most common cancer worldwide with more than 1.9 million new cases of colorectal cancer in 2020.10 In the US, the ColonFlag algorithm is marketed as LGI-Flag(TM), as an indication for lower GI disorders.

Additional algorithms for oncology, cardiology and other diseases, such as lung and infectious diseases, are already in the pipeline. navify Algorithm Suite is currently available in Europe and Asia-Pacific.

Vabysmo data suggest rapid and robust drying of retinal fluid in patients with neovascular or ‘wet’ age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema

Real-world studies of Vabysmo demonstrate ability to extend treatment intervals in the first four months while maintaining visual acuity

Clinical data on an investigational anti-interleukin-6 treatment in uveitic macular edema will be presented for the first time





Basel, 13 April 2023 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that new data for its approved and investigational medicines will be highlighted in 30 abstracts at the 2023 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Annual Meeting, which will be held from 23-27 April 2023 in New Orleans, United States. The abstracts showcase the strength and breadth of Roche’s Ophthalmology portfolio, including post-hoc data from phase III Vabysmo® (faricimab) studies that support its benefit in drying retinal fluid in neovascular or ‘wet’ age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME).1-3 Real-world data on Vabysmo treatment patterns and outcomes will be presented, as well as approaches to personalised healthcare that include the use of artificial intelligence (AI) modelling to predict retinal disease progression.4-7 Additionally, phase I data for an investigational anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) treatment in uveitic macular edema (UME), to be presented for the first time, suggest the monoclonal antibody may improve visual acuity in patients with UME.8

“The breadth of data we are presenting at ARVO demonstrates our sustained commitment to preserving vision for people with potentially blinding retinal conditions,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are particularly encouraged by data indicating that Vabysmo may stabilise blood vessels and reduce fluid in the retina. Fluid control is essential for optimal central vision used for everyday activities such as reading and driving.”

Story continues

The following data will be presented at ARVO 2023:

Vabysmo improves drying for people with nAMD and DME1-3

A post-hoc analysis from the head-to-head dosing period of the phase III TENAYA and LUCERNE studies suggests Vabysmo results in greater drying of retinal fluid compared to aflibercept in people with nAMD. The data include change in central subfield thickness (CST), absence of subretinal and intraretinal fluid (SRF and IRF) and time to absence of SRF and IRF.

A post-hoc analysis from the head-to-head dosing period of the phase III YOSEMITE and RHINE studies also supports the positive impact of Vabysmo on macular blood vessel leakage compared to aflibercept in people with DME. Outcomes include macular leakage area and the proportion of patients with minimal to no macular leakage - two important markers of vascular stability. Another analysis from YOSEMITE and RHINE suggests Vabysmo reduces retinal fluid when compared to aflibercept in people with DME. The data include time to absence of DME (CST <325 µm) and time to absence of IRF.

Vabysmo extends dosing intervals early in the real world4,5

Two Vabysmo real-world studies in nAMD and DME show patients extended their dosing intervals early in their treatment while maintaining or improving their vision. The majority of patients were able to extend their treatment intervals during the four initial doses. Treatment intervals were categorised as ‘extended’ if any interval was more than six weeks apart.

Investigational IL-6 monoclonal antibody may benefit people with UME8

Phase I data on an IL-6 inhibitor that is in development for UME and other retinal conditions suggest that this investigational monoclonal antibody improves visual acuity and CST in patients with UME.

The IL-6 pathway plays an important role in the development and progression of UME by promoting blood vessel leakage and inflammation.9 UME is a complication of uveitis, a form of eye inflammation.10 This results in accumulation of fluid in the macula and can lead to significant visual impairment and vision loss.10 The estimated prevalence of uveitis is between 6 to 12 people per 10,000 globally, and approximately one-third of these people are impacted by UME.11

Roche recently launched two phase III trials in UME based on encouraging phase I safety and efficacy data. The first patients have been treated in the Meerkat ( NCT05642312 ) and Sandcat ( NCT05642325 ) studies, which are evaluating the safety and efficacy of the monoclonal antibody in people with UME.12,13 Roche is also studying the IL-6 inhibitor in DME.14

AI and machine learning6,7,15-17

Roche will also present research related to the diagnosis and treatment of retinal conditions. These presentations include new research on the use of AI and machine learning to predict disease progression in geographic atrophy, a progressive and irreversible form of AMD; enable timely and accurate assessment of disease activity in nAMD or DME; predict treatment response in DME; and investigate new imaging biomarkers in diabetic retinopathy.

About neovascular age-related macular degeneration

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that affects the part of the eye that provides sharp, central vision needed for activities like reading.18 Neovascular or ‘wet’ AMD (nAMD) is an advanced form of the disease that can cause rapid and severe vision loss if left untreated.19,20 It develops when new and abnormal blood vessels grow uncontrolled under the macula, causing swelling, bleeding and/or fibrosis.19 Worldwide, around 20 million people are living with nAMD – the leading cause of vision loss in people over the age of 60 – and the condition will affect even more people around the world as the global population ages.18,21,22

About diabetic macular edema

Affecting around 21 million people globally, diabetic macular edema (DME) is a vision-threatening retinal condition associated with blindness and decreased quality of life when left untreated.23 DME occurs when damaged blood vessels leak into and cause swelling in the macula – the central area of the retina responsible for the sharp vision needed for reading and driving.24,25 The number of people with DME is expected to grow as the prevalence of diabetes increases.26

About the Vabysmo® (faricimab) clinical development programme

Roche has a robust phase III clinical development programme for Vabysmo. The programme includes AVONELLE-X, an extension study of TENAYA and LUCERNE evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of Vabysmo in neovascular or ‘wet’ age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), and Rhone-X, an extension study of YOSEMITE and RHINE evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of Vabysmo in diabetic macular edema (DME).27,28 In addition, Roche is investigating the efficacy and safety of Vabysmo in people with macular edema following retinal vein occlusion in two phase III studies, BALATON and COMINO.29,30 Roche has also initiated several phase IV studies, including the Elevatum study of Vabysmo in underrepresented patient populations with DME, the SALWEEN study of Vabysmo in a subpopulation of nAMD highly prevalent in Asia, as well as the VOYAGER study, a global real-world data collection platform.31-33 Roche also supports several other independent studies to further understand retinal conditions with a high unmet need.14

About Vabysmo® (faricimab)

Vabysmo is the first bispecific antibody approved for the eye.34,35 It targets and inhibits two signalling pathways linked to a number of vision-threatening retinal conditions by neutralising angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A).36,37 Ang-2 and VEGF-A contribute to vision loss by destabilising blood vessels, causing new leaky blood vessels to form and increasing inflammation.36,37 By blocking pathways involving Ang-2 and VEGF-A, Vabysmo is designed to stabilise blood vessels. Vabysmo is approved in 60 countries around the world, including the United States (U.S.), Japan, the United Kingdom and in the European Union for people living with neovascular or ‘wet’ age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema.14,34,35,38,39 Review by other regulatory authorities is ongoing.

About Roche in ophthalmology

Roche is focused on saving people’s eyesight from the leading causes of vision loss through pioneering therapies. Through our innovation in the scientific discovery of new potential drug targets, personalised healthcare, molecular engineering, biomarkers and continuous drug delivery, we strive to design the right therapies for the right patients.

We have the broadest retina pipeline in ophthalmology, which is led by science and informed by insights from people with eye diseases. Our pipeline includes gene therapies and treatments for geographic atrophy and other vision-threatening diseases, including rare and inherited conditions.

Applying our extensive experience, we have already brought breakthrough ophthalmic treatments to people living with vision loss. Susvimo™ (ranibizumab injection) 100 mg/mL for intravitreal use via ocular implant is the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved refillable eye implant for neovascular or ‘wet’ age-related macular degeneration that continuously delivers a customised formulation of ranibizumab over a period of months.40 Vabysmo® (faricimab) is the first bispecific antibody approved for the eye, which targets two signalling pathways that drive retinal conditions.34,37 Lucentis®* (ranibizumab injection) is the first treatment approved to improve vision in people with certain retinal conditions.41

Impact of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War on Sampling Needle Market:

The COVID-19 pandemic that has swept the globe has had a devastating impact on all businesses. Any impediment to industry has a direct impact on the region’s economic growth. The unusual increase in the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases across nations, as well as the accompanying shutdown to battle the virus’s transmission in the first two quarters of 2020, has caused countless firms to go on alert. Because of the aforementioned factors, technological investments fell in 2020. The unexpected lockdown enforced in many nations throughout the world due to the COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant influence on the Sampling Needle market, causing considerable price volatility and reducing activity.

https://news.yahoo.com/cheyenne-roche-why-food-truck-035900072.html,Cheyenne Roche: Why the food truck fight?,"Apr. 6—Restaurant owners and council members have been debating the merits of food trucks as they discussed updating the city's peddler code.

The motion passed 4-3 and lowered the cost for food trucks coming from other communities. Where a one-day pass previously cost $50, a one-week pass will now cost only $20.

Restaurant owners in attendance spoke vehemently against making it easier for food trucks to do business in Creston.

There is a concern that by not owning a brick-and-mortar building, these food vendors are not paying taxes. But that's not true. Each ticket comes with a sales tax paid by the customer. At least some of that money goes back into the community in which it was purchased.

There seems to be a belief food trucks will take money away from our local restaurants, but studies show those claims are unfounded.

A 12-year study conducted by Injustice for Justice found food trucks do not represent a major threat to the restaurant industry. ""Not only do restaurants vastly outnumber food trucks—across the study period, the average county had 145 restaurants and just one food truck—but both sectors generally grew over the 12 years studied,"" the study states. ""Even as food trucks took off following the Great Recession, the restaurant industry continued to grow.""

The average food truck to restaurant ratio in each county across the country is 1 to 145.

Economic surveillance showed no decline in restaurants following growth of food trucks. ""We found a positive relationship between the number of food trucks and the number of restaurants in the same year, suggesting both sectors can thrive at the same time,"" it stated.

I think of our Creston boutiques as the perfect example of this. During Merry Marketplace, our boutiques opened their doors and provided a space for vendor booths to sell their products. I remember seeing a candle display at House of Pain during an event. Even though the store sells candles, they encouraged patronage of a small vendor booth selling the same product.

Story continues

Paisley Rose Boutique has hosted Weld, a permanent jewelry booth, multiple times despite selling jewelry of their own.

There's no need to tear each other down. There are a wide range of food options we don't have in Creston. I would really love some authentic Italian food. A nice steaming bowl of gnocchi is one of my favorite dishes, yet I can't get it here.

Imagine if we built each other up instead. What if a cupcake food truck came to town and partnered with a local restaurant. They could offer $2 off your cupcakes if you had dinner at XYZ restaurant.

The world is changing. Consumers rule the market, not the businesses. If consumers want a product, which clearly they want this, restaurants will need to learn how to work with them.

The Schwan's truck has been coming to town for how long and has never been required to get a license to sell. That money doesn't stay in this community.

When I think of a food truck, I think of one of two things. The first is an event. Market on Maple, Fiesta on Maple, Hot Air Balloon Days, etc... In that setting, I'm not going to leave the event to eat at a restaurant. I'm just not. I want to walk around and eat and shop. If there are no food options, I will wait until I get home to eat. My business was never going to go to a restaurant anyway.

I'm from a town of 2,400 in Wisconsin that hosts our county fair. There are always two food booths we always visit — the Optimist Club stand for their cheese curds (best in the world) and the 4-H stand for ice cream. But outside of that, there are a plethora of food truck options including corn dogs, fresh-squeezed lemonade and funnel cakes.

When I first attended the local county fairs, I was disappointed by the lack of food options. I understand the thought of keeping the money in the county, but one booth with limited options isn't enough. Again, I didn't leave the county fair and go eat in Afton. No one got my money that day.

The second scenario in which I think of a food truck is a one-day deal. I remember the day the rolled ice cream truck came to town two years ago and parked in a lot on Taylor Street. When I drove by on my way home from work, there were dozens waiting in line.

If these food trucks are smart, they will come to town on a Sunday. Sometimes after getting the house back up and in order after the work week, I want to go out to eat Sunday night. There are almost no options. This is especially frustrating during football season when I just want to get some dinner and watch football.

If restaurants are already choosing to close one day of the week, there should be no problem with a food truck taking that day's business.

The fact of the matter is the people want this. Feedback provided after Merry Marketplace showed people wanted more food options. It's disheartening to hear restaurant-owners speak against what the community wants based on their own profit margins.","['Cheyenne Roche', 'The Creston News Advertiser']",

https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/education/2406096-roche-diagnostics-india-unveils-beyourownshero-campaign-to-educate-women-about-cervical-cancer-prevention,Roche Diagnostics India Unveils #BeYourOwnShero Campaign to Educate Women About Cervical Cancer Prevention,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India(NewsVoir) Cervical Cancer is India's second most common cancer, affecting more than 1.23 lakh women each year. Around 77,000 Indian women die of the disease. Despite being the only preventable cancers, awareness about effective and reliable screening tools remains poor. The fact that there is stigma, fear and lack of active platforms that drive conversations about India's need for cervical cancer screening programmes, both at the public health and consumer level, has compelled Roche Diagnostics India to launch the #BeYourOwnShero campaign. And who better than Vidya Balan, celebrated for pioneering a change in the portrayal of women in Bollywood and an epitome of courage, could be the voice that drives this cause. #BeYourOwnShero is an integrated campaign with social and digital advocacy initiatives, engaging influencers and medical experts, as well as partnerships and on-ground activities to educate women about cervical cancer facts, break myths about vaccination versus screening, as well as inform them about the gold standard HPV test. The campaign includes the launch of 4 Hero films across various digital platforms - Facebook, YouTube and LinkedIn and a dedicated resource hub cervicalcancer-prevention.com. where interested women can sign up for more information on HPV screening. The campaign is a part of Roche's long-term commitment and an ongoing initiative to drive meaningful change through partnerships, communication, funding and action to help close the gaps in women's health and reduce the burden of cervical cancer in India which accounts for nearly 25% of global cases. As the first leg of the campaign, Roche Diagnostics India introduced free HPV screening for all women employees and women family members of male employees in the required age group (35-65 years)1. While 82% of the eligible employees opted for screening, Roche Diagnostics India set forth to expand its efforts in bringing down the burden of cervical cancer in India. The two Hero films launched so far have garnered around 3 million views and have been trending on FaceBook and YouTube. Roche Diagnostics India's follower growth on social media has increased by 15% in the month of March and its YouTube follower growth has been more than 80%. The company has also partnered with the Cancer Awareness, Prevention and Early Detection Trust (CAPED) to drive awareness about HPV screening amongst working women from Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad & Bangalore. As part of this initiative, CAPED will reach out to 10,000 women across these 5 metros and conduct around 100 workshops. Roche has also engaged with leading medical experts such as Dr HrishikeshPai, President, Federation of Obstetricians &Gynecologists of India (FOGSI), Dr Rishma Pai, honorary consultant gynaecologist at Lilavati, Jaslok and Hinduja Health Care Hospitals, Mumbai, Dr Nandita Palshetkar, Co-founder, Bloom IVF, and Dr Priya Ganesh, Chairperson ONCOLOGY Committee FOGSI to build advocacy at clinical level. Roche has also introduced the #MyStoryForChange initiative – a unique platform for women to share stories that capture inadequacies or shortcomings in healthcare access. So far, Roche has collected more than 500 stories from women across the globe. Talking about the reason that inspired her to join the campaign, Vidya Balan said, ""An average Indian woman wakes up every morning to fight the smaller battles of life. Getting her kids ready for school, running to catch a bus; going to work and keeping life afloat. But in this daily routine she seldom thinks of her own health and wellbeing. The reason I joined the campaign is to educate women across the country about the benefits of timely screening for cervical cancer. For example, I was stunned to know that this is the only cancer that is preventable if screened on time. It is important that we women challenge the status quo and take necessary steps to focus on our health and create the much-needed systemic change in healthcare outcomes."" Manjira Sharma, Head of Communication & CSR, Roche Diagnostics & Neighbouring Markets said, ""Our #BeYourOwnShero campaign focuses on educating women and inspiring them to take control of their health and fight debilitating diseases such as cervical cancer which is preventable. We are extremely happy to share that our dream to end cervical cancer in India is supported by Vidya Balan and institutional partners such as the CAPED to further strengthen our efforts."" The WHO has been committed to eliminating Cervical Cancer by 2030 by focusing on vaccination, screening and treatment and recommends cervical cancer screening through a high performance HPV DNA test. Women between the ages of 30-65 years are recommended to be screened and the test needs to be repeated every 5-10 years. In fact, screening even just twice in a lifetime once at 35 years and then at 45 years is beneficial. By educating women and inspiring them to take control of their health, the #BeYourOwnShero campaign is a step towards creating the much-needed systemic and behavioural change in prioritising health and changing the healthcare trajectory. However, the question is how do we make headway in shifting the mindset of people and policymakers? How can we integrate self-care into our culture so that it is done with 'No exceptions, no exclusions, no excuses'? The team at Roche Diagnostics will be ready to share insights, perspectives and inputs for any of your questions. About Roche Diagnostics India Roche is the world's largest biotech company.

The ovarian cancer drugs market consists of sales of Paclitaxel, Cisplatin, Adriamycin PFS (Doxorubicin Hydrochloride), Carboplatin, Cyclophosphamide, and Platinol (Cisplatin). Values in this market are 'factory gate' values, that is the value of goods sold by the manufacturers or creators of the goods, whether to other entities (including downstream manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers) or directly to end customers. The value of goods in this market includes related services sold by the creators of the goods.



The ovarian cancer drugs refer to cancer drugs to treat ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is caused due to abnormal growth of cells in the ovary. This industry includes establishments that produce drugs used in chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery for treating ovarian cancer. The ovarian cancer drugs include Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome, Evacet (Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome), Cytoxan (Cyclophosphamide), Paraplat (Carboplatin), Taxol (Paclitaxel), Neosar (Cyclophosphamide) and others.



North America is the largest region in the ovarian cancer drugs market in 2022. Middle East is expected to be the fastest growing region in the forecast period. The regions covered in the ovarian cancer drugs market report are Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, Middle East and Africa.



The main types of tumors in ovarian cancer drugs are epithelial ovarian cancer, ovarian low malignant potential tumor, germ cell tumor, and sex cord-stromal tumor. The most frequent kind of ovarian cancer is epithelial ovarian cancer. The majority of ovarian tumors (90 percent) are epithelial.

Story continues

Ovarian cancer that began in the epithelial layer protecting the ovary is known as epithelial ovarian cancer. The different types of drugs include alkylating agents, mitotic inhibitors, antirheumatics, antipsoriatics, VEGF/VEGF inhibitors, parp inhibitors, antineoplastics, others, and distribution channels such as hospital pharmacies, drug stores, others.



The rising incidence of ovarian cancer is driving the ovarian cancer drugs market. Furthermore, ovarian cancer is recorded to be the eighth most commonly occurring cancer in women and the 18th most commonly occurring cancer across the globe. According to a study by The World Ovarian Cancer Coalition an estimated 55% rise is expected in the number of patients suffering from ovarian cancer by 2035.

According to the Cancer Statistics in 2020, published by the American Cancer Society, about 1,806,590 new cancer cases and 606,520 deaths were expected in the USA. Thus, the increasing incidence of ovarian cancer cases across the globe drives the ovarian cancer drugs market growth.



The increasing use of biologics and targeted therapies is restraining the Ovarian Cancer drug market growth. Targeted therapies act as substitutes for drugs as they identify and attack cancer cells rather than destroying normal cells. For example, Bevacizumab is a targeted therapy biologics drug used to treat Ovarian Cancer.

A targeted therapy drug, Zejula was approved by FDA for ovarian cancer, and many targeted therapy drugs such as PARP inhibitors (targeted therapy drug) are undergoing clinical trials and are in the drug pipeline. FDA has also approved Genentech's biologics license for ovarian cancer drugs highlighting the fact many new companies are entering the biologics ovarian drug cancer market. Hence, the growing popularity of alternatives such as biologics and targeted therapies may hinder the growth of the ovarian cancer drugs market.



Drug manufacturing companies in the industry are increasingly innovating and developing combination drugs to treat ovarian cancer drugs. Combination drugs consist of two or more active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) that are combined into a single dosage form to treat complex medical conditions.

The pharmaceutical companies in the ovarian cancer drugs market are investing in the research and development of innovative products such as combination drugs to reduce manufacturing costs, increase compliance and efficiency, improve medication concordance, increase profitability and reduce side effects. For instance, Roche's blockbuster tranquilize Avastin (bevacizumab), is a combination drug approved by FDA, with ingredients such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, which is utilized to treat advanced stage (III or IV) ovarian cancer.



The Ovarian cancer drugs market is governed by the regulatory framework of agencies such as the Food and Administration Agency (FDA) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). FDA's recommendation for the ovarian cancer drugs market in the form of guidelines is mentioned within the CFR's (Code for Federal Regulations) title number 21 under part 312, which contains sub-parts from subpart 'A' to subpart 'I'.

The sub-part 'E' deals with the procedures designed to push the development, evaluation, and marketing of drugs related to therapies aimed to treat persons with life-threatening illnesses such as kidney cancer. Subpart 'E' also includes guidelines for the monitoring and evaluation of clinical trials of ovarian cancer drugs and other cancer drugs by agency officials to determine whether new treatments are safe and effective, or better than existing treatments. All companies operating in the ovarian cancer drugs industry are required to abide by the regulations under FDA.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd: Roche data highlights strength of ophthalmology portfolio and commitment to advancing eye care at ARVO 2023,"Vabysmo data suggest rapid and robust drying of retinal fluid in patients with neovascular or 'wet' age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema

Real-world studies of Vabysmo demonstrate ability to extend treatment intervals in the first four months while maintaining visual acuity

Clinical data on an investigational anti-interleukin-6 treatment in uveitic macular edema will be presented for the first time





Basel, 13 April 2023 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that new data for its approved and investigational medicines will be highlighted in 30 abstracts at the 2023 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Annual Meeting, which will be held from 23-27 April 2023 in New Orleans, United States. The abstracts showcase the strength and breadth of Roche's Ophthalmology portfolio, including post-hoc data from phase III Vabysmo® (faricimab) studies that support its benefit in drying retinal fluid in neovascular or 'wet' age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME).1-3 Real-world data on Vabysmo treatment patterns and outcomes will be presented, as well as approaches to personalised healthcare that include the use of artificial intelligence (AI) modelling to predict retinal disease progression.4-7 Additionally, phase I data for an investigational anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) treatment in uveitic macular edema (UME), to be presented for the first time, suggest the monoclonal antibody may improve visual acuity in patients with UME.8

""The breadth of data we are presenting at ARVO demonstrates our sustained commitment to preserving vision for people with potentially blinding retinal conditions,"" said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. ""We are particularly encouraged by data indicating that Vabysmo may stabilise blood vessels and reduce fluid in the retina. Fluid control is essential for optimal central vision used for everyday activities such as reading and driving.""

The following data will be presented at ARVO 2023:

Vabysmo improves drying for people with nAMD and DME1-3

A post-hoc analysis from the head-to-head dosing period of the phase III TENAYA and LUCERNE studies suggests Vabysmo results in greater drying of retinal fluid compared to aflibercept in people with nAMD. The data include change in central subfield thickness (CST), absence of subretinal and intraretinal fluid (SRF and IRF) and time to absence of SRF and IRF.

A post-hoc analysis from the head-to-head dosing period of the phase III YOSEMITE and RHINE studies also supports the positive impact of Vabysmo on macular blood vessel leakage compared to aflibercept in people with DME. Outcomes include macular leakage area and the proportion of patients with minimal to no macular leakage - two important markers of vascular stability. Another analysis from YOSEMITE and RHINE suggests Vabysmo reduces retinal fluid when compared to aflibercept in people with DME. The data include time to absence of DME (CST <325 µm) and time to absence of IRF.

Vabysmo extends dosing intervals early in the real world4,5

Two Vabysmo real-world studies in nAMD and DME show patients extended their dosing intervals early in their treatment while maintaining or improving their vision. The majority of patients were able to extend their treatment intervals during the four initial doses. Treatment intervals were categorised as 'extended' if any interval was more than six weeks apart.

Investigational IL-6 monoclonal antibody may benefit people with UME8

Phase I data on an IL-6 inhibitor that is in development for UME and other retinal conditions suggest that this investigational monoclonal antibody improves visual acuity and CST in patients with UME.

The IL-6 pathway plays an important role in the development and progression of UME by promoting blood vessel leakage and inflammation.9 UME is a complication of uveitis, a form of eye inflammation.10 This results in accumulation of fluid in the macula and can lead to significant visual impairment and vision loss.10 The estimated prevalence of uveitis is between 6 to 12 people per 10,000 globally, and approximately one-third of these people are impacted by UME.11

Roche recently launched two phase III trials in UME based on encouraging phase I safety and efficacy data. The first patients have been treated in the Meerkat) and Sandcat) studies, which are evaluating the safety and efficacy of the monoclonal antibody in people with UME.12,13 Roche is also studying the IL-6 inhibitor in DME.14

AI and machine learning6,7,15-17

Roche will also present research related to the diagnosis and treatment of retinal conditions. These presentations include new research on the use of AI and machine learning to predict disease progression in geographic atrophy, a progressive and irreversible form of AMD; enable timely and accurate assessment of disease activity in nAMD or DME; predict treatment response in DME; and investigate new imaging biomarkers in diabetic retinopathy.

About neovascular age-related macular degeneration

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that affects the part of the eye that provides sharp, central vision needed for activities like reading.18 Neovascular or 'wet' AMD (nAMD) is an advanced form of the disease that can cause rapid and severe vision loss if left untreated.19,20 It develops when new and abnormal blood vessels grow uncontrolled under the macula, causing swelling, bleeding and/or fibrosis.19 Worldwide, around 20 million people are living with nAMD - the leading cause of vision loss in people over the age of 60 - and the condition will affect even more people around the world as the global population ages.18,21,22

About diabetic macular edema

Affecting around 21 million people globally, diabetic macular edema (DME) is a vision-threatening retinal condition associated with blindness and decreased quality of life when left untreated.23 DME occurs when damaged blood vessels leak into and cause swelling in the macula - the central area of the retina responsible for the sharp vision needed for reading and driving.24,25 The number of people with DME is expected to grow as the prevalence of diabetes increases.26

About the Vabysmo® (faricimab) clinical development programme

Roche has a robust phase III clinical development programme for Vabysmo. The programme includes AVONELLE-X, an extension study of TENAYA and LUCERNE evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of Vabysmo in neovascular or 'wet' age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), and Rhone-X, an extension study of YOSEMITE and RHINE evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of Vabysmo in diabetic macular edema (DME).27,28 In addition, Roche is investigating the efficacy and safety of Vabysmo in people with macular edema following retinal vein occlusion in two phase III studies, BALATON and COMINO.29,30 Roche has also initiated several phase IV studies, including the Elevatum study of Vabysmo in underrepresented patient populations with DME, the SALWEEN study of Vabysmo in a subpopulation of nAMD highly prevalent in Asia, as well as the VOYAGER study, a global real-world data collection platform.31-33 Roche also supports several other independent studies to further understand retinal conditions with a high unmet need.14

About Vabysmo® (faricimab)

Vabysmo is the first bispecific antibody approved for the eye.34,35 It targets and inhibits two signalling pathways linked to a number of vision-threatening retinal conditions by neutralising angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A).36,37 Ang-2 and VEGF-A contribute to vision loss by destabilising blood vessels, causing new leaky blood vessels to form and increasing inflammation.36,37 By blocking pathways involving Ang-2 and VEGF-A, Vabysmo is designed to stabilise blood vessels. Vabysmo is approved in 60 countries around the world, including the United States (U.S.), Japan, the United Kingdom and in the European Union for people living with neovascular or 'wet' age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema.14,34,35,38,39 Review by other regulatory authorities is ongoing.

Two of the more impressive performers during the Kingdom’s National Football League Division 1 campaign, Glenflesk’s Darragh Roche and Na Gaeil’s Stefan Okunbor, have been given hope of seeing action before the end of the All Ireland championship by selector Diarmuid Murphy despite recent injury set backs.

Speaking at the launch of the Munster championships in Páirc Uí Chaoimh on Wednesday afternoon, the Dingle club man confirmed that the pair “will be out for the foreseeable future, yeah. Other than that we're [okay]. Stefan has a hamstring injury and Darragh has a hand injury.”

Such was the quality of their performances over the course of the league, that the pair would have had reasonable expectations of challenging for a place in the starting fifteen come championship, and at the very least would have been used as impact subs off the bench.

The injuries will dent their chances of making that breakthrough, at least in the short term, with the Munster championship wrapping up inside the next four weeks.

For Okunbor it must be a particularly galling thing to have happened, having missed so much football since his return to the county in the autumn of 2021 following his spell Down Under in the AFL with the Geelong Cats.

He picked up an injury while playing for his club Na Gaeil in the All Ireland club semi-final in January 2022, and having made his way back to fitness suffered another set back in the warm-up to the Kingdom’s Munster championship semi-final with Cork a few months later, scuppering his chances of featuring in the All Ireland series.

The former AFL man’s recent progress was then halted with a hamstring injury he picked up in the Kingdom’s defeat at the hands of Tyrone in Healy Park, Omagh in early March. The half-back / midfielder seems not to have any luck when it comes to injuries.

“No [Stefan hasn’t had much luck],” Murphy concurred.

""Which is a pity for him, because he's been playing really well for us. It’s disappointing for him, it’s disappointing for us, but that’s the nature of the game, especially with the way the game is played now, a high-impact game you are going to get injuries and knocks along the way.

""It’s a pity, but hopefully they’ll see action before the year is out as well.”",[],

https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/03/28/roches-slow-growth-shouldnt-drive-investors-away/,Roche's Slow Growth Shouldn't Drive Investors Away,"Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche (RHHBY -0.70%) took a hit from a decline in sales of COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment products in 2022, with group sales inching up 2% at constant exchange rates (CER) to 63.28 billion Swiss francs ($68.34 billion). The company's pharmaceutical and diagnostic divisions were both affected, and net income came in at 13.5 billion francs ($14.6 billion), a decline of 6% compared to 2021 under international financial reporting standards (IFRS).

The company expects ""the sharp decline in sales of COVID-19 products"" to continue through 2023, leading sales to decrease ""in the low single digit range,"" although it also expects its sales of other products to show strong growth. More specifically, Roche anticipates a drop of 5 billion francs ($5.4 billion) in COVID-19-related sales this year -- roughly 8% of last year's total revenue.

The steep fall-off in sales of products to prevent and treat COVID-19 is a worldwide phenomenon, with almost two-thirds of last year's $100 billion in sales expected to evaporate industry-wide. For Roche, does the near-term softness signify that investors should take a step back?

Strength in the fight against cancer

Analysts are rating RHHBY a buy, perhaps on the strength of its pipeline. Roche refuses to rest on its laurels and has been successful. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved several new Roche products and/or indications in November and December:

Lunsumio for follicular lymphoma, a chronic type of blood cancer.

Tecentriq has a new indication for advanced rare sarcoma (cancer of the soft tissues).

Arthritis drug Actemra/RoActemra can now be used to treat adults hospitalized with COVID-19.

Two tests to detect Alzheimer's pathology in its early symptomatic stage.

The agency granted an Emergency Use Authorization for Roche's monkeypox virus test.

The cancer-focused products, in particular, could expand Roche's reach and revenue. The worldwide market for follicular lymphoma that Lunsumio addresses will grow from $2.2 billion in 2020 to $4 billion in 2028, according to Emergen Research. However, the drug is approved only for the fraction of patients whose cancer has come back after two or more courses of treatment, which will limit the sales potential. It is harder to come by a precise market estimate for advanced rare sarcoma; however, the World Health Organization notes that ""rare cancers account for about 25–30% of all cancer diagnoses and 25% of cancer deaths."" Additionally, treatment options for advanced or metastatic cancers tend to be limited, so patients and their physicians are always on the lookout for new, effective options such as Tecentriq.

A treasure trove of blockbusters

In Roche's annual report, CEO Severin Schwan noted that Vabysmo, a treatment for certain severe eye diseases that the company brought to market at the beginning of last year, ""became one of our most important growth drivers in just a few months."" This and four other top sellers -- Ocrevus for multiple sclerosis, Hemlibra for the bleeding disorder hemophilia, Evrysdi for spinal muscular atrophy, and Tecentriq -- accounted for 15.3 billion francs ($16.7 billion) in sales in 2022. And that's just five of the company's 16 blockbusters.

The good pipeline news for Roche continued in February when the company said a phase 3 clinical trial showed that its crovalimab achieved disease control in patients with the rare blood condition paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Grand View Research estimates the market for PNH treatments will increase from $3 billion in 2020 to $5.8 billion in 2025 in the U.S., Japan, the U.K., Germany, France, Spain, and Italy.

In March, an FDA advisory committee voted yes on the clinical benefit of Roche's Polivy combination for patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, another type of blood cancer. Coherent Market Insights says it expects the world market for treatments for this type of cancer to increase from $1.36 billion in 2020 to $1.97 billion in 2027, potentially offering a modest boost to Roche's sales if the FDA approves Polivy, although several other large pharmaceutical companies also offer treatments.

Pipeline's promise of future growth

What will all these developments mean for Roche's development over the longer term? In the annual report, Chairman Christoph Franz pointed to ""87 new compounds and 65 additional indications in clinical development or registration"" and new products coming out of its diagnostics division as the basis for future growth. With so many multibillion-dollar treatments, the COVID-19 projected sales drop is far from a deal-breaker. In fact, recent approvals could offset some of that drop, allowing the company's growth to be consistent.

A glance at Roche's earnings per share over the past decade shows that despite fluctuations, the company does have a solid history to back up its plans, a possible harbinger of slow but steady growth going forward. During that period, Roche's dividend has grown, albeit slowly, reporting roughly 28% growth.

Swiss pharma giant Roche on Wednesday announced plans to jointly develop a blood test for Alzheimer’s disease with American heavyweight Eli Lilly, eying swift U.S. approval as companies race to create and sell the very first drugs aimed at slowing the progressive cognitive decline brought on by the incurable illness.

Key Facts

Eli Lilly will work with Roche to develop a blood test to detect the early stages of Alzheimer’s, the Swiss firm said in a statement on Wednesday. The test, called the Elecsys Amyloid Plasma Panel, measures the levels of a particular protein in the blood that has been linked to the onset of Alzheimer’s. While not intended as a standalone test—further confirmatory tests for Alzheimer’s would be needed—Roche said it speeds up the diagnostic process and helps direct people to the most appropriate resources. As Alzheimer’s has a similar set of symptoms to other causes of dementia, a negative test is also useful and could help many people avoid the expensive and invasive tests used to confirm Alzheimer’s. Roche Diagnostics chief executive Matt Sause said the firm is excited to be working with Lilly on “such an important area of unmet medical need.” The test “has the potential to streamline a person's journey to diagnosis” and, therefore, speed up access to future treatments, Sause added.

News Peg

There is no cure for Alzheimer’s and, until recently, there was no treatment to slow the disease’s progression. The FDA controversially approved Biogen’s aducanumab, sold as Aduhelm, in 2021. The clinical data supporting the decision has been heavily criticized, as was the FDA’s adherence to protocol in approving it. The agency greenlit lecanemab, sold as Leqembi and produced by Biogen and Japan’s Eisai, on an expedited basis in January, though access is limited. The agency is expected to make a complete decision on the drug in July. Both treatments are monoclonal antibodies that target a type of protein that builds up in the brain of people with Alzheimer’s. As they are aimed at slowing progression, early detection can be key and help preserve as much of the brain’s functioning as possible. While certainly medical breakthroughs, they are eye-wateringly expensive, require frequent intravenous administration and, at best, appear to only modestly slow mental decline. Future Alzheimer’s drugs with similar targets—Lilly is in the final stages of clinical trials for one—are likely to also benefit from earlier intervention.

What To Watch For

Roche and Lilly are eying U.S. regulatory approval for the test. They are aiming to file clinical trial data with U.S. regulators in 2025, Bruce Jordan, leader of personalized healthcare solutions at Roche Diagnostics told Reuters. Between now and then, Roche said it will recruit several hundred volunteers with early signs of dementia to trial the treatment and gather data.

Key Background

Alzheimer’s Disease is a progressive brain disorder marked by the slow erosion of cognitive abilities and memory. It is the most common type of dementia, a broad category used to describe conditions linked to cognitive decline, and is primarily, though not exclusively, a condition affecting older adults. There are as many as 5.8 million Americans living with Alzheimer’s, the CDC estimates, and it is the sixth leading cause of death among U.S. adults. That figure is projected to grow to 14 million people by 2060 and the costs associated with the disease are expected to reach up to $500 billion annually by 2040 in the U.S. alone. Though strides have been made in recent years, there is a great deal we do not know about Alzheimer’s. Scientists are still not settled on what causes it—a matter of heated debate—or why it appears more often as we grow older.

But things have worked out just fine for him.

In February, Roche took the reins as CEO of Moog, the Elma-based motion equipment maker and one of the region’s largest manufacturers.

These are auspicious times for the company, including:

• A $77 million expansion announced for its campus, the first of three planned projects.

• A $250 million contract to produce turrets for Army vehicles that is ramping up.

• Being part of the Bell Textron team chosen to produce a next-generation helicopter for the Army – a selection awaiting final authorization by the Government Accountability Office.

These projects – among many others – underscore the impact of homegrown Moog. The company has 13,000 employees worldwide, including about 3,500 in Western New York.

Roche, 59, is in select company. He is only the fourth CEO in the history of Moog, going back to the early 1950s. Before joining Moog, Roche worked for a variety of employers and lived in different countries. That background helped prepare him to lead a company with a global presence and diverse business operations that generated $3 billion in revenues in its past fiscal year.

But there’s more to Roche than his résumé.

He was born to Irish parents in Manchester, England, and later moved with his family to Ireland. He’s a fan of Irish rugby who is now a Bills season ticket holder. He’s a distance runner who has competed in marathons around the world, and plans to run the Chicago Marathon this fall.

For about 40 years, Roche has known John Scannell, his predecessor as Moog CEO. An engineer by training, Roche said he is humbled and excited to lead Moog. He thinks about how widely the company’s products are used, in everything from delivering a rover to Mars, to military and commercial aircraft, to oil exploration and auto assembly plants.

“It's out in the field,” Roche said. “These things are real. This isn’t the startup company that has this big idea to put something into space and maybe it will happen, maybe it won’t. We’re doing these things and have been doing it for 71 years, at this point.”

Roche himself has steadily become a bigger player within Moog's operations over the past two decades. But he made a few other career stops first.

Career path

When Roche graduated from college in Ireland, job opportunities there were limited. He took a job in 1986 with Phillips Consumer Electronics in the Netherlands, which had a shortage of engineers. Learning Dutch was a job requirement. Co-workers were expected to speak to each other in Dutch, even if they knew English.

Roche later joined a consultancy in London, before moving on to a position based at his alma mater, University College Cork. Roche worked on building a bridge between academia and industry, to promote turning research into product development.

Roche changed course by joining a startup called Lumin8, where he set up manufacturing activities for its energy-efficient lighting product. He organized an international supply chain and product testing.

“I call this my second MBA, actually,” Roche said.

Some potential customers wanted even more extensive testing of their own, which slowed down the sales process. “When you have that, and you have a small startup company, that’s when you get into, 'How do I manage the cash, how do we pay wages for all the people and wait until we’re able to get sales with this?'”

Lumin8's founders ultimately decided they lacked the deep enough pockets to keep the business going, and opted to license the technology instead. The company shut down its manufacturing operations, which was a disappointment to Roche.

Roche briefly went back into a tech commercialization position at his alma mater before taking a job with a company that had a presence in Ireland: Moog.

Joining Moog

Roche already knew quite a bit about Moog, from the academia-industry role he had held earlier in his career. Moog was one of the companies he had worked with.

Still, Roche wasn’t planning to stay with Moog long term when he came aboard.

“It was a surprise to me that I’m 23 years at the company,” he said. “That wasn’t the intent going in.”

Roche joined Moog as a design engineering manager for Moog in Cork, with a team of 20 to 25 employees.

His second day on the job, Scannell – at the time the general manager of the Ireland facility – told Roche: “I’m thinking of reorganizing, would you mind changing your job?”

“That sort of characterized the first number of years at Moog as well,” Roche said. “It felt like even though I was with one company now, there were new opportunities coming up. I was getting the chance to try new things, new skills or learn new skills as I was going.”

Roche remained based in Ireland, but the scope of his responsibilities changed and grew over time. He was named a company officer in 2012 and frequently traveled to the United States over the next few years. In 2015, he was named head of Moog’s industrial group.

The idea of working in the United States always appealed to Roche. He had gotten to know Americans and their work ethic from his frequent business trips.

“The thing that stands out to me is, no problem is too big, nothing can’t be overcome or nothing is insurmountable,” he said. “We find a way. I like that attitude. I find that attractive.”

At the end of 2021, Roche was named chief operating officer and relocated to the United States.

Last November, Scannell announced his retirement as CEO, effective in February, after serving in that role since 2011. The board named Roche his successor. Scannell remains nonexecutive chairman of the board.

“I have complete confidence in Pat and the next generation of leadership to build on the past and take the company to new heights,” Scannell wrote in his annual letter to shareholders.

In an interview last fall, Scannell said Moog focuses on developing leaders from within its ranks and seeing how they respond to challenges outside their comfort zone.

“Putting someone in the CEO role, you have to start at least 10 years in advance,” Scannell said. “It’s not two years in advance.”

In the CEO's chair

Roche's time as COO helped him get to know people on the Elma campus and learn more about Moog's other business operations. Now he's settling into the CEO's role.

""I don’t know all the answers as a leader,"" he said. ""I have great people in the organization, very talented people around me.

""We work to share our insights, our different perspectives on things, to reach the best quality decisions we can,"" he said. ""I think that’s how I’m wired. I’ve always been collaborative by nature.""

Moog has found business opportunities outside its traditional avenues. The company makes components for electric construction vehicles, in partnership with Doosan Bobcat. Roche said Moog tapped into the know-how of engineers from across Moog's different operating groups, instead of just one business segment.

""When people look at our business and they look at all these end markets, they might think that’s a strange collection of end markets that they’re serving,"" he said. ""For me, the underpinning is a common layer of technology capability.""

Like other manufacturers, Moog faces some challenges with its supply chain, filling vacant jobs, and investing in its operations for the future. But Roche feels upbeat about the outlook for each of Moog's core businesses.

He may not have expected to stay at Moog long term when he started at the company, but he's come to appreciate Moog's history and significance.

“I expect this company to be here decades into the future,"" he said. ""My goal is to ensure we maintain that longevity as an organization.”","['Matt Glynn News Business Reporter', 'Matt Glynn', 'Buffalo News File Photo', 'Derek Gee Buffalo News']",

March 22 (Reuters) - Roche (ROG.S) and Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) are joining forces to develop a blood test for Alzheimer's disease, and plan to kick off a two-year clinical trial involving hundreds of volunteers with the aim of winning U.S. regulatory approval.

The effort, unveiled in a statement on Wednesday, comes as Lilly as well as Eisai (4523.T) and Biogen (BIIB.O) are gearing up to sell drugs aimed at slowing the advance of the mind-robbing illness, but their use will require a diagnosis at earlier disease stages than is the norm today.

Roche Holding AG would recruit several hundred volunteers with early signs of dementia over the next 18 to 24 months with trial data potentially ready for a U.S. regulatory filing in 2025, Bruce Jordan, leader of Personalized Healthcare Solutions at Roche Diagnostics, told Reuters.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has asked Roche to recruit a significant number of patients at primary care facilities or family doctors, which has made the trial ""a huge undertaking"" because the rate of Alzheimer's among those seeking initial help for dementia is as yet uncertain.

""We acknowledge that this is something that a single entity does not have the best chance of solving on its own, so we partnered up with Lilly,"" said Jordan.

Eisai (4523.T) and Biogen's (BIIB.O) drug Leqembi won FDA approval in January under an accelerated review process, seen as a major breakthrough in therapy development.

""We are incredibly excited that there are going to be treatment options soon. ... This will, of course, have a significant impact on the demand for testing,"" said Jordan.

Efforts by drugs and diagnostics maker Roche to develop its most advanced Alzheimer's drug failed last year, but its work on test kits and drug research continued.

The blood test detects traces of the toxic protein beta amyloid, which builds up in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. The Leqembi drug has been shown to remove amyloid from the brain and Lilly's drug candidate is also based on that principle.

Roche's test, known as Elecsys Amyloid Plasma Panel, is not designed to provide a definitive answer on a patient's Alzheimer's status but to identify people who should advance to more expensive and burdensome confirmatory tests such as PET scans or spinal fluid analysis.

Roche hopes to sell the blood test, which will be analysed in standard labs using Roche machines, on the promise that it will help healthcare systems reduce the need for PET scans or spinal fluid tests.

Lilly has already developed a blood test that targets P-tau217, another protein that is an indicator of Alzheimer's, and is working with Quanterix Corp (QTRX.O).

Quest Diagnostics Inc (DGX.N) and C2N Diagnostics have also launched Alzheimer's blood tests using different approaches.

Roche and Eli Lilly will join forces on the development of Roche’s Elecsys Amyloid Plasma Panel, a blood test that aims to facilitate the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, Roche said on Wednesday.

The test, if approved, could help determine whether patients should receive further evaluation that may confirm a diagnosis and could help them access new therapies as they become available, the company said.

Up to 75% of people living with symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease lack a diagnosis, while patients with a diagnosis typically received one 2.8 years after the onset of symptoms, the company said.

The test has demonstrated clinical performance and is undergoing additional investigation to ensure clinical validation, Roche said.

Roche announced in July that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted the test its breakthrough device designation. In December, Roche gained FDA 510(k) clearance for its Elecsys beta-Amyloid (1-42) CSF II and Elecsys Phospho-Tau (181P) CSF assays that identify Alzheimer's pathology in its early symptomatic stage.

""We are pleased to be joining Roche to support the development of yet another potential diagnostic tool,” Mark Mintun, Lilly group vice president for neuroscience R&D, said in a statement. ""We look forward to the robust data and continued collaboration across the field that will be critical to accelerate the ecosystem to aid in a timely and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer’s.""

The collaboration comes after Lilly earlier this month announced it would halt testing of solanezumab, once its top Alzheimer’s drug candidate, after 20 years of research because the treatment showed no benefit in a clinical trial.",['Susan Kelly'],2023-03-22 09:53:00

By Patricia Weiss and Ludwig Burger

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer Chairman Norbert Winkeljohann has won backing for his re-election from a pair of major shareholder advisory firms despite criticism from two German investment groups for his numerous board commitments.

In separate reports made available to Reuters, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis said they were backing Winkeljohann when his term comes up for a renewal vote at the drug company's April 28 annual shareholder meeting.

Both firms declined to give any reasons for their recommendations.

German mutual funds groups DWS and Union Investment last month condemned the multiple board commitments of the Bayer chairman, adding to upheaval at the company which is the target of activist investors in the run-up to a change of chief executive on June 1.

© Thomson Reuters FILE PHOTO: The logo of Bayer is pictured at the company's plant in Lerma, Mexico

Union Investment at the time said it would not vote for Winkeljohann's re-election, while DWS would not be drawn on its voting intentions.

Winkeljohann led the search for a new chief and the eventual hiring of former Roche executive Bill Anderson, after earlier this year facing calls from numerous investors to quickly replace CEO Werner Baumann.

In a further sign of investor support, weekly magazine WirtschaftsWoche this month cited unnamed sources as saying that Temasek, the sovereign wealth fund of Singapore and a major shareholder in Bayer, will back the re-election of Winkeljohann.

A former head of six European countries at auditing and consulting firm PwC, Winkeljohann has chaired Bayer's non-executive board since 2020.

He is also Deutsche Bank's deputy chairman, chairman at unlisted wholesale trade groups Sievert SE and Bohnenkamp AG as well as a board member at steel maker Georgsmarienhuette GmbH.

In its notice of the AGM, Bayer has said the ""supervisory board has satisfied itself"" that Winkeljohann is able to make time for his duties, taking into account his seats on other boards.

Bayer's incoming CEO Anderson inherits a full in-tray from his predecessor: thousands of lawsuits claiming its Roundup weedkiller causes cancer, an underwhelming drug development pipeline, and disgruntled investors looking for major change.

Bayer has repeatedly said Roundup is safe to use and that environmental regulators share that view.

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/roches-slow-growth-shouldnt-drive-investors-away,Roche's Slow Growth Shouldn't Drive Investors Away,"Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche (OTC: RHHBY) took a hit from a decline in sales of COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment products in 2022, with group sales inching up 2% at constant exchange rates (CER) to 63.28 billion Swiss francs ($68.34 billion). The company's pharmaceutical and diagnostic divisions were both affected, and net income came in at 13.5 billion francs ($14.6 billion), a decline of 6% compared to 2021 under international financial reporting standards (IFRS).

The company expects ""the sharp decline in sales of COVID-19 products"" to continue through 2023, leading sales to decrease ""in the low single digit range,"" although it also expects its sales of other products to show strong growth. More specifically, Roche anticipates a drop of 5 billion francs ($5.4 billion) in COVID-19-related sales this year -- roughly 8% of last year's total revenue.

The steep fall-off in sales of products to prevent and treat COVID-19 is a worldwide phenomenon, with almost two-thirds of last year's $100 billion in sales expected to evaporate industry-wide. For Roche, does the near-term softness signify that investors should take a step back?

Strength in the fight against cancer

Analysts are rating RHHBY a buy, perhaps on the strength of its pipeline. Roche refuses to rest on its laurels and has been successful. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved several new Roche products and/or indications in November and December:

Lunsumio for follicular lymphoma, a chronic type of blood cancer.

Tecentriq has a new indication for advanced rare sarcoma (cancer of the soft tissues).

Arthritis drug Actemra/RoActemra can now be used to treat adults hospitalized with COVID-19.

Two tests to detect Alzheimer's pathology in its early symptomatic stage.

The agency granted an Emergency Use Authorization for Roche's monkeypox virus test.

The cancer-focused products, in particular, could expand Roche's reach and revenue. The worldwide market for follicular lymphoma that Lunsumio addresses will grow from $2.2 billion in 2020 to $4 billion in 2028, according to Emergen Research. However, the drug is approved only for the fraction of patients whose cancer has come back after two or more courses of treatment, which will limit the sales potential. It is harder to come by a precise market estimate for advanced rare sarcoma; however, the World Health Organization notes that ""rare cancers account for about 25–30% of all cancer diagnoses and 25% of cancer deaths."" Additionally, treatment options for advanced or metastatic cancers tend to be limited, so patients and their physicians are always on the lookout for new, effective options such as Tecentriq.

A treasure trove of blockbusters

In Roche's annual report, CEO Severin Schwan noted that Vabysmo, a treatment for certain severe eye diseases that the company brought to market at the beginning of last year, ""became one of our most important growth drivers in just a few months."" This and four other top sellers -- Ocrevus for multiple sclerosis, Hemlibra for the bleeding disorder hemophilia, Evrysdi for spinal muscular atrophy, and Tecentriq -- accounted for 15.3 billion francs ($16.7 billion) in sales in 2022. And that's just five of the company's 16 blockbusters.

The good pipeline news for Roche continued in February when the company said a phase 3 clinical trial showed that its crovalimab achieved disease control in patients with the rare blood condition paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Grand View Research estimates the market for PNH treatments will increase from $3 billion in 2020 to $5.8 billion in 2025 in the U.S., Japan, the U.K., Germany, France, Spain, and Italy.

In March, an FDA advisory committee voted yes on the clinical benefit of Roche's Polivy combination for patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, another type of blood cancer. Coherent Market Insights says it expects the world market for treatments for this type of cancer to increase from $1.36 billion in 2020 to $1.97 billion in 2027, potentially offering a modest boost to Roche's sales if the FDA approves Polivy, although several other large pharmaceutical companies also offer treatments.

Pipeline's promise of future growth

What will all these developments mean for Roche's development over the longer term? In the annual report, Chairman Christoph Franz pointed to ""87 new compounds and 65 additional indications in clinical development or registration"" and new products coming out of its diagnostics division as the basis for future growth. With so many multibillion-dollar treatments, the COVID-19 projected sales drop is far from a deal-breaker. In fact, recent approvals could offset some of that drop, allowing the company's growth to be consistent.

A glance at Roche's earnings per share over the past decade shows that despite fluctuations, the company does have a solid history to back up its plans, a possible harbinger of slow but steady growth going forward. During that period, Roche's dividend has grown, albeit slowly, reporting roughly 28% growth. It likely won't make your portfolio grow exponentially, but it could provide a stable position to an investor looking for balance.

About COVID-19 home tests

A rapid antigen test (RAT) is a screening tool used to detect COVID-19 in asymptomatic humans. Similar to a pregnancy test, it is quickly taken at home without the need for lab equipment or a health professional. Instead, you simply place a saliva sample or nasal swab into a chemical solution and wait for the results to show up. This usually takes less than 30 minutes.

RATs are not as accurate as a PCR test and have a higher chance of a false negative. If you receive a positive result or are suffering from COVID-like symptoms, you will need to arrange a PCR COVID test from a clinic and immediately self-isolate.

COVID-19 testing kits require TGA approval and inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) before they can be legally sold in Australia. You can purchase them from the above stores starting on 1 November 2021. Stock is expected to be limited, so grab yourself a kit while they are still available.

https://pharmaphorum.com/news/swiss-biotech-noema-raises-112m-roche-castoffs,Swiss biotech Noema raises $112m for Roche castoffs,"Swiss biotech Noema has added another $112 million to its funding in an oversubscribed second round, as it takes neurological disorder drugs licensed in from Roche through clinical development.

The Series B – led by Forbion and Jeito Capital – comes around two years after the Basel-based company raised $59 million in a first round, bolstering its resources as it runs multiple mid-stage trials hoping to demonstrate proof-of-concept for its drug candidates.

Its lead product is basimglurant (NOE-101), an mGluR5 inhibitor that is phase 2b trials in two indications – persistent seizures in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a severe form of epilepsy, and severe pain in trigeminal neuralgia.

The FDA granted fast-track designation to basimglurant last year for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, a chronic condition that affects the trigeminal nerve carrying sensations from the face to the brain, which can cause excruciating pain.

It has few treatment options, with therapy mainly relying on carbamazepine, a decades-old anticonvulsant drug that has limited efficacy and can cause side effects including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and tremors.

The four-year-old company is also running phase 2b trials of PDE10a inhibitor gemlapodect (NOE-105) in Tourette syndrome and childhood onset fluency disorder (COFD) – also known as stuttering – and is preparing mid-stage testing of NOE-115, a triple reuptake inhibitor for atypical depression and binge eating disorder.

Another compound inherited from Roche, mGluR2/3 inhibitor NOE-109, has yet to advance out of preclinical testing, where it is being evaluated for potential disease indications.

Along with the two lead investors, the round was joined by previous backers Sofinnova Partners, Polaris Partners, Gilde Healthcare, and Invus. Nanna Lüneborg from Forbion and Rachel Mears from Jeito Capital ware joining Noema’s board following the round.

Noema was founded in 2019 with a seed investment from Sofinnova partners and is led by chief executive Luigi Costa, former CEO of Nordic Nanovector and a senior executive at Onyx Pharma, ahead of its acquisition by Amgen in 2014.

The company’s chief medical officer, George Garibaldi, was previously a vice president in Roche’s R&D operations.

“This financing comes at a key time for Noema Pharma as we look forward to extensive news flow over the next 24 months,” said Costa, adding, they are ""very pleased to have a world-class group of investors supporting our vision of bringing much-needed treatments to those living with debilitating central nervous system disorders.”",[],

https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/colleges-scramble-to-prepare-for-possible-end-of-affirmative-action/ar-AA19W33l,Colleges scramble to prepare for possible end of affirmative action,"© David L. Ryan/Globe Staff Prospective students, parents, and others took a campus tour at MIT.

For decades, affirmative action has served as an essential tool for colleges to increase diversity on campus. Now, with the Supreme Court seemingly poised to ban the practice, higher education leaders are scrambling to mitigate the fallout and come up with strategies to accomplish diversity goals.

College officials are wary of sharing detailed plans ahead of the expected ruling from the conservative-leaning court in the coming months, often at the guidance of lawyers. But the officials and admissions consultants say universities are seeking to strengthen relationships with community colleges and high schools in underserved areas to reach prospective students, while also rethinking practices that largely benefit affluent, white students.

In short, colleges are hoping to send a message that their doors are open to students of all backgrounds, regardless of how the court decides, and that there will be supportive communities awaiting them, experts said.

Middlebury College, for its part, is gathering research and data related to how competitive public colleges have pursued diversity in the nine states that bar affirmative action in college admissions, said Nicole Curvin, dean of admissions at the Vermont school.

“We’re moving into a new territory, but it doesn’t mean that there aren’t opportunities for us,” Curvin said. The outreach, she said, is helping Middlebury ”get creative and thoughtful about building on the work that we’ve already done.”

Some university leaders are doubling down on their public commitments to diversity ahead of the court decision, worried that students of color won’t apply if affirmative action ends.

“A fear is that underrepresented students start feeling that their chances of being admitted to a school like ours diminish, [which] would be the most unfortunate thing that could come out of this,” said Jim Roche, vice provost for enrollment management at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “We have to continue to let people know that everybody’s welcome here.”

Others are working together. As the justices deliberate the admissions case, 16 selective colleges, including Yale, MIT, Colby, and Brown, joined forces to help reach more students living in rural communities who may not have access to Advanced Placement courses and who lack guidance on post-high school options.

The effort, which includes hiring staff focused on reaching rural students and flying in students for campus tours, is an example of colleges working to strengthen recruitment relationships outside of affluent suburban and private high schools.

“Our aim is to enroll as broadly diverse a student body as we can because it makes the education here better,” said Stuart Schmill, MIT’s dean of admissions and student financial services. “We are excited to join this network because we can reach more students collectively than we can individually.”

Many selective colleges say race is one of many factors considered in the admissions process. Without that tool, admission consultants and researchers say it will be difficult to maintain campus diversity without drastic changes.

That has been the case in California, where a 1996 state proposition barred the use of race-conscious admissions practices at public universities. In a court filing in the current challenge, the University of California said admissions by underrepresented groups at its most competitive campuses dropped by 50 percent or more following the ban. The numbers have improved somewhat in recent years as the system sought “wide-ranging, race-neutral measures” to recruit diverse students, though the populations of Black, Latino, and Native American students still lag.

“UC’s decades-long experience with race-neutral approaches demonstrates that highly competitive universities may not be able to achieve the benefits of student body diversity through race-neutral measures alone,” Cal officials wrote in the court filing.

The case before the nation’s high court centers on complaints filed by the nonprofit group Students for Fair Admissions against Harvard and the University of North Carolina. The group argues that the colleges’ admissions processes that consider race are unfair and lead to stereotyping and discrimination. Many expect the justices to reverse a 2016 decision resulting from Fisher v. the University of Texas at Austin, which upheld the limited use of race in admissions.

To boost their chances of attracting diverse students through race-neutral means, college leaders need to reconsider how they approach lower-income families, consultants said.

The nation’s wealthiest universities, which have more ability to lower the cost of attendance for low-income students, will be better positioned to attract underrepresented students than competitors, said Rob Bielby, managing director at the higher education practice of consulting firm Huron. Still, high sticker prices can dissuade students from applying, so being clear about how much aid a school can offer is critical, experts said.

“If you’re sending the same communication pieces that you’ve been sending to high-income families and upper-middle-income families that are primarily white, then you’re probably not presenting your brand in the best way to engage with diverse populations,” Bielby said.

Colleges are also evaluating what programs and practices could be at risk, including scholarships for students of a specific race, said Madeleine Rhyneer, who leads enrollment consulting at EAB.

“Students from low-income groups worry most about cost,” Rhyneer said. “It’s the first thing they consider, so schools need to be clear about financial aid and meeting need.”

The University of Pennsylvania has spent about 18 months building a free online course for high school students wanting to learn more about post-high school options and the college admissions process.

“While I think it is probably useful for any students looking to go to college, it’s really designed for students who would be less likely to have people around them who are well versed in college,” said Whitney Soule, dean of admissions.

Penn also wants prospective applicants to know it’s open to students of all backgrounds, she said.

“The way that we do our work will be modified to make sure that we’re within the bounds [of the law], but we will not be diminishing the message around how important diversity is for the educational experience here,” Soule said.

Still, it’s important that college officials don’t think statements in support of diversity are enough, said Michele Siqueiros, president of the nonprofit Campaign for College Opportunity in California. She said colleges need to make changes and reconsider whether all of their practices align with institutional goals.

“We still have colleges that use legacy preferences,” Siqueiros said. “How are you going to eliminate practices that have proven to be inequitable like legacy admissions? How are you going to look at admissions in a more holistic fashion to really measure the potential talent of students and not overly rely on test scores or AP classes that may not be offered everywhere?”

Colleges also have work to do overcoming reputations of “whiteness” and wealth, said Bielby, the Huron consultant. It will take time to earn trust in communities that have felt historically excluded from elite campuses.

“Even if [diverse students] have been admitted and offered excellent scholarships, they question whether or not they’re going to fit and whether that’s going to be a good experience for them,” Bielby said. “This isn’t just about admission — it’s also about retention.”",[],

Luxor Workspaces and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission have announced a recall of over 85,000 carts used for audiovisual equipment—the kind often seen in schools for wheeling out large TV sets. The carts can tip over and have caused the deaths of three children, according to the CSPC.

“Consumers should stop using the recalled carts immediately and contact Luxor for a free repair. Luxor will provide metal ballast kits, which should be installed by the consumer to the lower shelf of the cart to add stability and weight,” the CSPC said in a statement.

The TV cart manufacturer will also provide new labels for the carts warning that objects over 25 pounds shouldn’t be placed on the carts, which have wheels on the bottom.

“New warning labels cautioning consumers to place no more than 25 lbs. on each shelf will also be provided. Consumers should attach these warning labels on each shelf,” the CSPC continued.

The carts have been linked to the deaths of three children between 2006 and 2016, according to a press release from the CSPC, and at least one serious injury. The children were crushed by large CRT TV sets, the kind that are no longer commonly purchased in the U.S. with the rise of flat-screen TVs but can still be present in homes and schools.

The carts have been sold since at least the early 1980s and have more recently been available for purchase at online retailers like Amazon, 123Stores and Grainger. The carts sell for between $125 and $250.

The model numbers for the recalled carts include the WT42 “Tuffy” plastic cart; the W42/AVJ42/SS-AVJ42 metal cart; and the LP-DUO/TPDUOEQ plastic cart. The CSPC has a full list of the model numbers along with how to identify each at its website.

“Luxor and Stand Steady AV carts are safe when used as intended and in accordance with the company’s operating instructions and warning labels. This has been the case since we first sold these carts in the early 1980s,” Luxor Workspaces President Paul Roche said in an emailed statement.

“Luxor is conducting a voluntary recall in partnership with the CPSC to help further ensure the safety of our AV carts – especially if a cart is loaded with a CRT ‘box’ TV and used in a location in which children may be present. The few reported accidents occurred when children were left unsupervised near an AV cart that was holding a CRT TV,” Roche continued.

The recall includes both the U.S. and Canada and any consumers with questions are encouraged to visit Luxor’s website, which includes a section on frequently asked questions and information on how to get the ballast repair kits.

“It is important to note that here have been no recorded incidents involving these carts and children since 2016, which may be linked to the fact that CRT TVs have mostly been replaced by much lighter, newer model TVs,” Roche said.

“Most of our AV carts are sold to businesses and institutions where children are not present,” Roche added.","['Matt Novak', 'Amy Danise']",2023-04-14 00:00:00

His final -- and only season -- in Boston was 2013.

A decade later, that one year and the events surrounding it have inspired Dempster to run the Boston Marathon.

""I'm super thrilled to be running the Boston Marathon. I started 10 years ago on Patriots' Day, that horrible day of the Boston bombing, and our team was part of something really special afterward with the city to rally around and trying to turn a tragedy around into triumph,"" Dempster told WBZ-TV's Dan Roche.

Dempster was the starting -- and winning -- pitcher on that Patriots' Day in 2013, a day that forever left an impact. He's running the 2023 Boston Marathon for the Lingzi Lu Foundation.

""I want to run to honor and remember all the people who suffered that day and raise some money for a really special young lady, who is a great person to model yourself after.""

Dempster can recall many things from that unforgettable time, including when David Ortiz addressed the Fenway crowd just five days after the tragedy.

""Walking into the locker room, you had the Mayor, the Governor, the head of the secret service, you had special forces, Navy Seals. You had military, Boston PD, Boston Fire, EMTs. Our locker room - you couldn't move there were so many people,"" he recalled. ""And in a weird, magical way, it provided this amazing connectivity where we almost felt invincible.

""We had all these people at our back,"" Dempster added. ""And David, you could tell he had something brewing in his head the way he was walking around. He said 'You don't want to miss this.'""

That's when Ortiz delivered one of the most memorable F-bombs in Boston history.

""Going out there, I get goosebumps just thinking about that,"" said Dempster. ""Him saying everything and not being afraid to drop an F-bomb. Because it was all true.""

Dempster and the Red Sox seemingly carried that emotion all the way to a World Series title. It was almost like it was meant to be.

""Yeah, it really did feel that way,"" said Dempster. ""Sometimes you can talk things into existence, so when you talk about it enough things actually happen. And we had the backing of a city, the backing of the fans, and we became an unstoppable force. We felt a lot of responsibility to go out there day in and day out and give everything we had, especially after everything that took place on Patriots' Day.""

Come Monday, Dempster will take that mindset onto the 26.2-mile course from Hopkinton to Boston when he runs in honor of Lingzi Lu.

""If I can do great by her name and bring some relief to families who suffered through this, in a special moment, that's what I'm running for,"" said Dempster. ""And I'm not going to stop. I'm going to keep going as hard as I can that day.""",[],

Harrisburg police are looking for 43-year-old Guy Stevenson for his involvement in an incident that took place on Saturday.

They say the incident was in the 1500 block of Briggs Street.

A city official says it started at 10:30 a.m. Saturday as a domestic incident.

A woman in her 30s was able to escape from the house unharmed with her boyfriend, Guy Stevenson, in his 40s, still inside, according to the official.

Police, Dauphin County CRT, and state police were communicating with Stevenson throughout the day.

They used flash bangs and tear gas in an attempt to get him out of the house. He was believed to be armed and dangerous and therefore a few nearby houses were evacuated.

Eventually, police went through the whole home and Stevenson was not found. Shortly after 8:30 p.m., the scene was deemed clear and residents were able to go back into their homes.

According to police, Stevenson is wanted for aggravated assault, terroristic threats, false imprisonment, simple assault, and possession of an instrument of crime.

Anyone with information on Stevenson is asked to contact the Harrisburg police at 558-6900 or by calling 911. Anonymous tips and information can also be submitted via Crimewatch.

https://news.yahoo.com/c-te-la-redoute-inside-171202793.html,What is the Côte de la Redoute? Inside the decisive climb of Liège-Bastogne-Liège,"Remco Evenepoel launches his winning move on La Redoute in the 2022 Liège-Bastogne-Liège

“The Côte de la Redoute is a Monument within a Monument” is how Liège-Bastogne-Liège director Christian Prudhomme recently described the race's most famous climb. La Redoute is not the steepest nor the longest of the ten to a dozen ascents included in each edition of La Doyenne but remains the focal point of the final Spring Classic of each season.

Although it was first climbed in the 1975 edition of a race which started in 1892 a sign stone the summit of the Côte de la Redoute says, “Here the greatest riders have forged their victories.”

La Redoute is not the hardest climb of Liège-Bastogne-Liège. An average gradient of a leg-burning 9.4% for 1.6 kilometres puts La Redoute behind two other frequently used Liège climbs in difficulty: the Stockeu (1 km at 12%) and the Côte de la Roche-aux-Faucons (1.3 km at 11%).

The more recently created Liège-Bastogne-Liège Femmes, now in its seventh edition, always uses this emblematic climb, and it plays a similar pivotal role as in the men's race. La Redoute also features in the Under-23 men's version of Liège, and puts in occasional appearances in the Tour de Wallonie, the region's leading stage race.

What makes La Redoute so important, compared to the two harder climbs, is its position in the race. The Stockeu always forms part of an early trio of ascents (Wanne - Stockeu - Haut-Levée) tackled in rapid succession and which combine to lift the curtain on the crucial last 80 kilometres of Liège. As for the recently introduced Roche-aux-Faucons, it provides one last opportunity for the climbers to blast away on their favoured terrain before the definitive drop back to Liège.

La Redoute, on the other hand, set midway between prelude and final conclusion, is like the main act of a play. It won't tell us who’ll be lighting up cigars and knocking back the champagne in the five-star hotel in the last scene and who’ll be down on their luck and out on the street. But La Redoute pinpoints who the main actors of the afternoon’s entertainment in Liège will be, and what kind of plans (then mislaid or not) they have for their future.

Story continues

Where La Redoute best played out that role as the main scene-setter was unquestionably the 1999 edition of Liège-Bastogne-Liège. In what was arguably the hugely controversial Belgian champion Frank Vandenbroucke’s finest racing moment, he and Italian Classics rival Michele Bartoli went toe to toe, a couple of metres apart but never so much as glancing at the other, nearly all the way to the summit.

Vandenbroucke briefly distanced Bartoli at the summit before easing back, then making a definitive attack in the Côte de Saint-Nicolas further on. But the tension of the two riders on La Redoute and then Vandenbroucke briefly edging clear remain some of the most memorable moments in the sport.

Frank Vandenbrouke briefly drops Michele Bartoli towards the summit of the Cote de la Redoute during the 1999 Liège-Bastogne-Liège

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, as double Liège winner Sean Kelly has pointed out on a number of occasions, La Redoute used to be the last big climb before the finish. As a result, if a breakaway escaped it was very hard to pull them back on the fast run-in.

The last part of the Liège-Bastogne-Liège route changed in the early 1990s, and the uphill finish at Ans and the last climb of the Côte de Saint-Nicolas rendered the Côte de la Redoute less relevant.

However, the return to the flat city centre finish on the Boulevard de la Sauvenière in 2019 has once again given the earlier climbs more prominence - and the Côte de la Redoute is, once again, back to being Liège's first climb among equals.

Since 2019, only one breakaway has formed on La Redoute and stayed away to the finish and it was a cracker. In 2022, Remco Evenepoel made a devastating attack on its highest slopes and soloed all the way to the line. It simultaneously marked a breakthrough moment for the young Belgian, saved the Classics team for his QuickStep team, and confirmed La Redoute’s revived status.

Remco Evenepoel attacks on La Redoute in the 2022 edition of Liège-Bastogne-Liège

Geographically, the Côte de la Redoute marks the point where after 200 kilometres the Liège-Bastogne-Liège men's race leaves behind the bleak, wild beauty of the southern Ardennes, with its dense forests, isolated farmsteads and hauntingly empty, windswept plateaus. From La Redoute onwards, the Classic enters a patchwork of suburban semi-rural sprawl made up of orderly gardens and chalets, out-of-town supermarkets and petrol stations. This gives way in turn to a bizarre mix of university parklands and industrial wasteland that merge into southern Liège and the finish next to the River Meuse.

Starting off as an outlying village lane, the earliest part of La Redoute is anything but photogenic, running as it does out past a series of vegetable gardens, and through a short, echoing concrete underpass beneath an ‘A’ road. The next segment heading right and parallel to the same main road is hardly more visually interesting. But the lone line of fans' caravans lining one side and the banners popping up between them make a difference and the slope, wavering between 8% and 10% at this point, is already beginning to bite.

Once the route takes a 90-degree turn left, a point easily spotted as that's normally where the race barriers begin, the 'real' Côte de la Redoute begins.

The middle section is narrow, increasingly steep and agonisingly straight, its gradient digging into the hillside past country fields, with slopes running from 8% to nearly 16% at the end of a single 200-metre ramp. There are even some thankfully brief pitches of 22% on the left-hand bend where this ramp, the worst of them all, finishes.

Cote de la Redoute

The atmosphere is invariably electric. The crowds on each side are rarely less than five or six deep, the noise deafening. In the 2017 Worlds in Norway, for example, when Flemish rider Yves Lampaert wanted to say how noisy and fired up the Scandinavian crowds had been, he said “they sounded just like the crowds on La Redoute.”

Every metre or two there’s another sign painted into the road graffiti reading 'Phil'-'Phil'-'Phil' in honour of local hero Philippe Gilbert, the 2011 Liège-Bastogne-Liège winner who was born in Remouchamps, the town at its foot. When it comes to the final 300 metres, the crowds thin out and the gradient drops away from 16 to two percent as it joins another farm track.

But then there’s a short, slightly tougher segment of 6% between two gentle gradients - and with narrow, twisting roads across a high plateau that follows that is often seen as the best place to attack: that's what Remco Evenepoel thought in 2022.

In an intriguing change, the 2023 race will not reach the usual highest point on the Côte de la Redoute. Instead it will deviate off towards a new small climb, the Côte de Cornemont, before heading onto the more frequently used Côte des Forges.

It’s ironic that an ascent as renowned as La Redoute did not originally have a name of any kind. The climb was called that purely because its earliest part originally started in a back street of Remouchamps called Rue de la Redoute. That road up was blocked when the motorway and its access roads were built, but the name still stuck.

The word redoute is a military term for a kind of earthworks outside a fortress, in this case built on the hill about Remouchamps during the build-up to a major battle in the French Revolutionary Wars of the 1790s. But regardless of its unnamed past, when it comes to its role in the sporting present and future, La Redoute remains pivotal and a name everybody in professional cycling cannot fail to know.",['Alasdair Fotheringham'],
https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/dermatologist-recommended-skincare-routine-women-233052678.html,Dermatologist-Recommended Skincare Routine For Women In Their 50s,"Turning 50 is a major milestone—especially for your skin. When you enter your 50s, your skincare routine switches from trying to maintain a blemish-free complexion, to preventing the body’s natural processes. Your 50s are when you could start seeing signs of wrinkles, fine lines, and sagging, as the skin’s elasticity declines. This decade can also bring a lot of hormonal changes with menopause, which also affects the skin.

While there are foods you can eat to boost collagen production, a solid skincare routine can help tighten sagging skin and blur fine lines. When you create a skincare routine for your 50s, it’s best to incorporate some active ingredients that will help speed up cell turnover and increase collagen production. It’s also important to focus on moisture because your skin barrier becomes drier as you age. Of course, before you create your own, skincare routine for your 50s, it’s best to consult a dermatologist.

To learn more about the best skincare routine for women over 50, we spoke with Dr. Yoram Harth, a board-certified dermatologist, a member of the American Academy of Dermatology. (AAD), and medical director of MDalgorithms. He recommends, “a comprehensive skincare routine that includes a cleanser, toner, exfoliating facial massage, moisturizer, eye cream, serums, and face masks.” Harth’s routine, which we’ve outlined below, will help women in their 50s achieve a more youthful, radiant complexion.

Morning

Cleanse

Harth says that it's best to start your day with a clean face. ""Begin your skincare routine with a gentle cleanser that removes makeup, dirt, and impurities. A good option is the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser or the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser,"" he recommends. ""If you have oily or acne-prone skin, try using MDacne's hydrating cleanser, which provides mild exfoliation and anti-acne effects without skin irritation.""

Moisturize

Then, he suggests applying a moisturizer to hydrate the skin and lock in moisture. ""Look for products with ingredients like hyaluronic acid and ceramides, such as the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel-Cream or the CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,"" he advises.

Story continues

Sunscreen

And, of course, no skincare routine is complete without sunscreen. ""Daily sun protection is a crucial step in any skincare routine, especially for women in their 50s,"" Harth emphasizes. ""Look for a broad-spectrum, oil-free sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, such as MDacne's Oil-Free Sunscreen, which provides protection against UVA and UVB radiation without clogging pores or causing breakouts."" Remember, you should be wearing sunscreen all year round—even in the winter!

Evening

Toner

And, in the evening, after cleansing again, Horth suggests using a toner that will tighten your pores and balance the skin's pH levels. ""A great toner option is the Thayers Witch Hazel Toner or the La Roche-Posay Effaclar Clarifying Solution Acne Toner,"" he raves.

Facial Massage

""Use an exfoliating facial massage tool, such as a jade roller or gua sha tool, to improve blood circulation and stimulate collagen production."" And, a facial massage with a gua sha tool will also help reduce the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines, and sagging skin.

Serums

Next, Horth advises incorporating a retinol serum into your 50s skincare routine. This type of serum promotes collagen production and reduces the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines. ""MDacne's Retinol Treatment Cream is a great option as it combines the magic of Retinol and Niacinamide,"" he says. ""Start using retinol at a lower concentration (0.25%) twice a week and gradually increase the concentration and frequency of application. Retinol and niacinamide combined can have a significant impact on aging skin and adult acne.""

Eye Cream

Finally, Horth says to use an eye cream that targets crow's feet, dark circles, and puffiness around the eyes. ""Some great options include the Olay Regenerist Retinol 24 Night Eye Cream or the La Roche-Posay Pigmentclar Eye Cream,"" he raves.

Once A Week

Face Masks

Horth also recommends using a face mask ""once or twice a week"" to really help trap moisture in the skin barrier. ""Some great options include the Laneige Water Sleeping Mask, MDacne's pink clay mask, or the Origins Clear Improvement Charcoal Mask,"" he notes.

The Bottom Line

Overall, by following this dermatologist-approved skincare routine from Dr. Horth, women in their 50s can achieve healthy, radiant-looking skin. And, if you're also curious about haircuts that are flattering for women in their 50s, check out some of these hair-stylist-recommended mature cuts!",['Georgia Dodd'],
https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/state-local-officials-join-dawoodi-bohras-in-billerica-for-breaking-of-ramadan-fast/ar-AA19Wbi2,"State, local officials join Dawoodi Bohras in Billerica for breaking of Ramadan fast","Apr. 16—BILLERICA — State and town officials joined the Dawoodi Bohras at the Anjuman-E-Ezzi mosque for an iftar dinner to break the fast on the fourth Friday of Ramadan.

Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll joined Billerica Town Manager John Curran, Deputy Police Chief Gerald Roche and other local officials and religious leaders for a breaking of the daily Ramadan fast going into the final week of the Muslim holy month, which concludes April 20.

Dawoodi Bohra member Taher Riyaz Esmail pointed out during the pre-dinner ceremony that there is currently an overlap of several major religions having significant holidays around the same time, and invited all to celebrate together.

""We are gathered here tonight, for Muslims we celebrate the holy month of Ramadan. Our Christian brothers and sisters just finished celebrating Easter. Our Jewish brothers and sisters just finished celebrating Passover. Our Sikh brothers ... are celebrating Vaisakhi, which is one of their most important religious events of the year,"" said Esmail.

Ever since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, Esmail said Muslims of all sects faced discrimination and hate in the U.S.

""We are a minority group in this country, and we have had our share of discrimination and hate directed at us since 9/11,"" said Esmail. ""It is important that we as a community report to the authorities any incidents that involve discrimination. We are very fortunate that we live in a state where most state and federal officials take this crime seriously.""

Gatherers listened to reading of a passage from the Quran, both in its original Arabic and translated into English, before Driscoll later addressed the crowd. Just a few months into Driscoll's tenure with Gov. Maura Healey, Driscoll said they are both grateful to have earned their roles and the responsibilities that come with them.

""We see great opportunities to be optimistic for the future of Massachusetts, especially when you are able to be part of nights like this. Nights where people are coming together to celebrate each other, both our differences and the things that bring us together,"" said Driscoll.

This month, Driscoll said, is a good time to gain a better appreciation and understanding of what Ramadan means for people both around the world and locally.

""For me, it is for fostering a greater understanding and sense of respect for the Muslim community in Massachusetts,"" said Driscoll. ""Certainly for the sense of community in this room. I can feel it, I hope all of you can feel it. This welcoming, this warmth and the recognition that we are better and stronger when we are together. That we can be a force for common good.""

On Friday, the official sunset time was 7:26 p.m. One of the main tenets of Ramadan is that those who celebrate go without food during daylight, meaning they can eat pre-dawn and after sunset, but not in between during the day. Esmail pointed out after Driscoll spoke that the ceremony was ahead of schedule. This would normally be a good thing, but Esmail joked that it meant there were still about 30 minutes before people could finally eat after a day of fasting.

When the sun finally did set, the men gathered for a prayer, followed by some light refreshments to break the fast before going to the dinner hall for a full meal, consisting of Indian dishes.

There are about 135 Dawoodi Bohra families in New England. One facet of the sect is that they must be truly contributing members of society, abide the laws of the country they live in, and to pursue knowledge while loving and respecting one's neighbors. The community had been present in New England for about 30 years before finally getting their own mosque in Billerica in 2004.

https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/the-7-best-cica-creams/ar-AA19V8y4,The 7 Best Cica Creams,"© Provided by Bustle

It’s true that a new trending ingredient or “must-have” product seemingly pops up every day. But one of those buzzy ingredients, centella asiatica, has actually been used for thousands of years in countries like India and China to help with wound healing and treating certain skin conditions. Also known as gotu kola, tiger grass, or cica for short, the plant is rich in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that make it especially great for dry, sensitive, and eczema-prone skin types. The best cica creams contain centella asiatica and/or one of its compounds (more on that ahead), and luckily, there are tons of great options under $25 to choose from.

Additionally, because they’re often geared towards those with skin sensitivities, cica creams will frequently be made without synthetic fragrances. On the list ahead, you’ll also find a few options that are free from essential oils, which can be used to naturally fragrance a product, but can also be a trigger for those with particularly sensitive skin. Even if you don’t consider your skin to be sensitive, cica creams are a great option for dry skin or for applying on nights when you’re using a retinoid because they are so gentle and nourishing. Many cica creams are even a great option for acne-prone skin as they can counteract the drying effects of ingredients like benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, while cica’s calming properties can help minimize redness from current and past breakouts.

One More Thing To Note

Though cica creams are most commonly formulated by Korean skin care brands, you’ll also notice many French brands with cica balms or creams. Now, here’s where things get tricky. Cicatrisation is a French term for healing and doesn’t necessarily mean the product is formulated with centella asiatica. All of the products on the list ahead include some form of centella asiatica, but when shopping online or in-store, you’ll want to scan the ingredients list to confirm it includes centella asiatica extract or one of its other soothing compounds (madecassoside, madecassic acid, asiaticoside, or asiatic acid).

Shop The Best Cica Creams

In a hurry? Here are the best cica creams:

1. Writer’s Pick: Best Multi-Purpose Cica Cream

La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Balm B5

Amazon

© Provided by Bustle

I can’t say enough good things about La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Balm B5, which has become the most essential part of my evening skin care routine. I first saw dermatologist Dr. Shereene Idriss raving about this cream on Instagram, and decided to give it a try about a year ago when I was experiencing breakouts and contact dermatitis from the constant mask wearing. Not only did this cream calm the redness and irritation I was experiencing, but it also seems to have helped minimize the frequency and severity of my breakouts in the long run. Originally developed to soothe irritation from diaper rash, the fragrance-free and noncomedogenic cream contains anti-inflammatory ingredients like zinc gluconate and madecassoside, the latter of which is a component of centella asiatica. Nourishing ingredients like shea butter, glycerin, and panthenol make this a serious moisturizer that can stand up to the winter months, but because it isn’t the least bit greasy, you can use it in the warmer months, too.

Cica Ingredient: Madecassoside Other Beneficial Ingredients: Glycerin, Shea Butter, Panthenol, Zinc Gluconate, Vitamin E, La Roche-Posay Thermal Spring Water Fragrance-Free: Yes Size: 1.35 oz.

Relevant Review: “This is the only cream that my face can tolerate, especially during rosacea flare ups. My skin is super sensitive and all of my prescription creams irritate my skin more. Super gentle unscented formula that instantly soothes itchiness and irritation. Tones down redness. It is also good for dermatitis, eczema and diaper rash.”

2. Best Cica Cream For Oily & Acne-Prone Skin

Mediheal Tea Tree Biome Blemish Cica Cream

Amazon

© Provided by Bustle

Yes, cica in general is great for acne-prone skin, but Mediheal’s Tea Tree Biome Blemish Cica Cream takes things a step further with the addition of tea tree. The essential oil has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties that can potentially help treat acne, and it’s even thought to help decrease oil production. Formulated with 50% tea tree leaf water and 25% centella asiatica extract, the green-tinted cream also includes moisturizing and antioxidant-rich ingredients like hyaluronic acid, green tea leaf extract, and avocado fruit extract.

Cica Ingredients: Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid Other Beneficial Ingredients: Tea Tree Leaf Water, Glycerin, Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea Leaf Extract, Vitamin E, Avocado Fruit Extract Fragrance-Free: Yes Size: 3.3 oz.

Relevant Review: “Drastically reduces breakouts, very moisturizing. I like that it’s unscented as well. Good for both daytime or nighttime.”

3. Best Cica Cream With Ceramides

COSRX Balancium Comfort Ceramide Cream

Amazon

© Provided by Bustle

COSRX might be best known for its snail mucin products, but the K-beauty brand’s Balancium Comfort Ceramide Cream has its own dedicated following on Reddit and Amazon. In here, centella asiatica leaf water (and several of centella asiatica’s compounds) provide soothing and moisturizing benefits, but the cream also includes ceramide NP. Not only do ceramides boost your skin’s hydration levels, but they’re also great for sensitive skin types because they help to strengthen the skin barrier to protect against moisture loss and environmental irritants. While this is made without synthetic fragrance, it’s important to note that it does contain limonene and bergamot fruit oil, which can be potential irritants for those with extremely sensitive skin.

Cica Ingredients: Centella Asiatica Leaf Water, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid Other Beneficial Ingredients: Glycerin, Sunflower Seed Oil, Ceramide, Panthenol, Niacinamide, Fragrance-Free: Yes Size: 2.8 oz.

Relevant Review: “I use this as my night cream. It goes on after the tretinoin and does a great job of soothing the skin as well as deep moisturizing. But it’s not heavy. It works during the winter months when my skin can get pretty dry and flaky. I do not like scented skincare products, but I love this cream’s light lemony one.”

4. Best Cica Cream With Ceramides Under $20

PURITO Centella Green Level Recovery Cream

Amazon

© Provided by Bustle

For a slightly less expensive cica cream that includes the benefits of ceramides, there’s this PURITO Centella Green Level Recovery Cream. The rich cream contains multiple moisturizing ingredients like squalane, shea butter, and hyaluronic acid, as well as multi-tasking niacinamide, which helps with everything from protecting the skin barrier to fading unwanted hyperpigmentation. Similar to COSRX, PURITO’s cica cream is free from synthetic fragrances, but it does contain naturally occurring fragrance compounds and essential oils like limonene, linalool, bergamot oil, and lavender oil, which can be potential irritants.

Cica Ingredients: Centella Asiatica Extract, Asiaticoside, Asiatica Acid, Madecassic Acid Other Beneficial Ingredients: Glycerin, Squalane, Niacinamide, Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Mushroom Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide Fragrance-Free: Yes Size: 1.7 oz.

Relevant Review: “This was my first time using a centella cream, but it won’t be the last! Incredibly soothing, speeds up healing, and reduces redness. When it’s extra hot outside, I like to put it in the refrigerator for a cooling effect. I will definitely repurchase — I just wish this came in a bigger container.”

5. Best Cica Gel Cream

MIZON Cica Aloe 96% Soothing Gel Cream

Amazon

© Provided by Bustle

If you’ve ever reached for a cooling aloe gel to calm irritation after shaving or spending the day out in the sun, consider MIZON’s Cica Aloe 96% Soothing Gel Cream. The lightweight gel mainly contains aloe leaf extract, but it also uses centella asiatica extract to provide relief from minor burns, irritations, insect bites, dryness, and itching. The oil-free formula naturally has a cooling effect when applied, but to really soothe and refresh your skin, try popping the container into the fridge for 10 minutes before you put it on.

Cica Ingredient: Centella Asiatica Extract Other Beneficial Ingredients: Glycerin, Aloe Leaf Extract, Hyaluronic Acid Fragrance-Free: Yes Size: 10.6 oz.

Relevant Review: “Love this stuff for any skin issues that you want a more gentle solution. It is amazing on burns (especially on wind burn) and is so soothing. It goes on almost cold to provide instant relief, and you can feel the effects for a long time. Very gentle for even the worst burns.”

6. Best Cica Body Cream

Boscia Cica Soothing Universal Cream

Amazon

© Provided by Bustle

Technically, you could use any of the face creams on this list on your body, too. But excluding the Mizon gel, they all come in a smaller size that would require you to use half of the bottle to do so. Boscia’s Cica Soothing Universal Cream comes in a slightly larger tube that was designed to be used on your face and body. While centella asiatica extract helps to calm irritated skin, the cream also includes soothing bisabolol and ginger root extract, as well as a probiotic and ceramides to maintain a healthy skin barrier. You can apply this lightweight cream on its own, or layer it over the brand’s Peptide Youth-Restore Firming Body Serum for even more hydration.

Cica Ingredient: Centella Asiatica Extract Other Beneficial Ingredients: Glycerin, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Panthenol, Bisabolol, Jojoba Seed Extract, Ceramide, Ginger Root Extract, Probiotic Fragrance-Free: Yes Size: 3.4 oz.

Relevant Review: “This is a must for dry sensitive skin. Very lightweight and hydrating without leaving my skin feeling greasy like some moisturizers do. My new go to!”

7. You May Also Like: This Cica CC Cream

Erborian CC Crème

Amazon

© Provided by Bustle

This isn’t a cica cream in the traditional sense, but if you’re looking to add some soothing benefits to your makeup routine Erborian’s CC Crème will be your new go-to. Designed to color correct and blur imperfections, the cream comes in three different tints that use encapsulated pigments to adjust to your skin tone. The results will give you light coverage with a soft glow — plus, additional sun protection thanks to SPF 25.

Shades: 3 Cica Ingredient: Centella Asiatica Extract Other Beneficial Ingredients: SPF 25, Glycerin, Honey Extract, Vitamin E Fragrance-Free: No Size: 1.5 oz.

Relevant Review: “Basically, this does exactly what I need it to do- it has SPF25, it evens out my complexion, keeps it moisturized, and looks completely natural. It also [has] ingredients that benefit the health of the skin, like Centella Asiatica, honey, and vitamin E, so that's a plus too[...] This is a product I use pretty much every day and I've already re-purchased it twice, and I'm not searching for anything else. Love it.”",[],

https://www.mmm-online.com/home/channel/prothena-leverages-walgreens-capabilities-to-accelerate-development-of-alzheimers-drug/,Prothena leverages Walgreens’ capabilities to accelerate development of Alzheimer’s Drug,"﻿Walgreens and Prothena Biosciences announced a collaboration this week to boost patient access and enrollment in clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease.

As part of the partnership, Walgreens will provide its pharmacy and patient-authorized clinical data to support the clinical trial for PRX012, Prothena’s anti-amyloid beta antibody for treating Alzheimer’s.

PRX012, which received a Fast Track designation from the Food and Drug Administration last April, is undergoing single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose studies. Prothena said it expects topline data to be available by the end of the year.

Walgreens stated that it will identify and engage with potentially eligible patients through the company’s several touchpoints, whether in-person, at home or digitally, to introduce them to Prothena’s ongoing clinical trials.

Following that interaction, Walgreens will invite interested patients or caregivers to complete a pre-screen form to determine eligibility to participate.

“Through Walgreens’ trusted community pharmacy presence and daily interactions with millions of patients across America, we believe we can have a meaningful impact in helping Prothena with their clinical trial recruitment efforts,” Ramita Tandon, chief clinical trials officer at Walgreens, said in a statement. “Our aim is to help build a more representative patient population for Alzheimer’s research, particularly among underserved and diverse communities, to create a better understanding of this disease.”

The two healthcare companies added that the collaboration aligns with the objective of the Equity in Neuroscience and Alzheimer’s Clinical Trials (ENACT) Act to increase the participation of underrepresented populations in clinical trials for Alzheimer’s and dementia.

“This innovative partnership will allow Prothena to leverage Walgreens unique capabilities to engage a broader and more representative patient population for potential enrollment in ASCENT-2 and accelerate the development of the PRX012 program to bring this potential best-in-class anti-amyloid beta antibody to patients as soon as possible,” said Hideki Garren MD, PhD, chief medical officer at Prothena, in a statement.

Walgreens and Prothena teaming up demonstrates that the Alzheimer’s space continues to show significant activity among prominent healthcare players.

Most notably, Biogen and Eisai are leading the pack with Leqembi, which received an accelerated approval from the FDA in early January and now has an adcomm meeting slated for June 9.

Weeks ago, Eli Lilly and Roche partnered to co-develop a blood test for facilitating an earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. Roche Diagnostics CEO Matt Sause stated that the test has “potential to streamline a person’s journey to diagnosis and, therefore, access to future treatment options.”

Not deterred by its Alzheimer’s drug donanemab failing to receive accelerated approval weeks after Leqembi, Lilly also recently said its experimental Alzheimer’s drug remternetug reduced amyloid in a small study.

Meanwhile, Takeda Pharmaceuticals joined forces with Treventis, a small Toronto-based biotech, on preclinical Alzheimer’s research.","[""Jack O'Brien""]",2023-04-14 19:10:25+00:00

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sarepta-down-on-reports-of-fda-almost-rejecting-dmd-gene-therapy,Sarepta Down on Reports of FDA Almost Rejecting DMD Gene Therapy,"Shares of Sarepta SRPT were down 9.4% on Apr 13 after a Stat News article claimed that the FDA was initially against approving the company’s biologics license application (“BLA”) seeking accelerated approval for SRP-9001 to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”).

Per the article, some of the FDA’s staff members reached a “non-binding conclusion” that SRP-9001 BLA should be rejected. However, the intervention of a top official of the agency Peter Marks, who also happens to be an advocate for faster gene-therapy approvals, shifted the FDA’s path toward discussing the BLA at an advisory committee meeting. Per the FDA website, Marks is the current director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”).

Earlier this week, Sarepta confirmed that the FDA’s Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee meeting on the SRP-9001 BLA is scheduled next month on May 12. This committee meeting is scheduled just weeks before the expected PDUFA date of May 29, 2023, set by the FDA for the SRP-9001 BLA.

If the article’s contents are true, it puts a question mark on the therapy’s merits claimed by Sarepta, based on which the filing for SRP-9001 was initiated.

Per a Reuters report, the FDA denied making any statements stating that it cannot comment on any unapproved product, while Sarepta is yet to confirm the same.

If approved by the FDA, SRP-9001 will be the first gene therapy for DMD patients. The therapy is also expected to generate a billion dollars in revenue for Sarepta. The gene therapy has been granted Fast Track, Rare Pediatric Disease (RPD) and orphan drug designations by the FDA.

Shares of Sarepta have declined 3.8% so far this year compared to the industry’s 3.1% fall.



Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

SRP-9001 is being developed by Sarepta in partnership with Roche RHHBY. Sarepta and Roche entered into a licensing agreement in 2019 to develop SRP-9001 for DMD. Per the agreement, Roche has exclusive rights to launch and commercialize SRP-9001 in ex-U.S. markets

The BLA filing, made to the FDA last September, is based on data from multiple studies in a clinical development program evaluating SRP-9001 in DMD. Last June, Sarepta and Roche announced new functional data across these studies, demonstrating that treatment with SRP-9001 led to functional improvements in individuals suffering from DMD compared with a propensity-weighted external control group multiple times. The time points vary from one-, two- and four years post-treatment.

Sarepta is evaluating SRP-9001 in an ongoing pivotal phase III study, EMBARK, which will serve as a confirmatory study seeking full approval for the therapy in DMD.

Currently, Sarepta’s commercial portfolio consists of three RNA-based PMO therapies targeting DMD — Exondys 51, Vyondys 53 and Amondys 45. These drugs can potentially address nearly a third of all patients with DMD in the United States.

Other than SRP-9001, Sarepta is also developing SRP-5051 (vesleteplirsen), its next-generation exon-skipping pipeline candidate for treating DMD patients with skipping exon 51. This February, management also started an early-stage study (VOYAGENE) evaluating its other gene therapy candidate, SRP-9003, in patients with Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) type 2E/R4

https://www.alzforum.org/news/conference-coverage/what-happens-after-amyloid-plaque-removal-who-benefits-most,What Happens After Amyloid Plaque Removal? Who Benefits Most?,"14 Apr 2023

Even though there were no big revelations from immunotherapy trials at this year’s International Conference on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases, held March 28 to April 1 in Gothenburg, Sweden, new data from several programs deepened the field’s understanding of what happens when amyloid plaque is cleared from a person's brain. Different sets of trial data painted a remarkably consistent picture, showing that mopping up large amounts of plaque blunts downstream biomarkers of tau pathology, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. Clinical differences only become detectable once Aβ is mostly banished, i.e., below the threshold for brain-wide positivity.

Removing plaque normalizes downstream tau and neuroinflammation markers.

Complete removal is crucial for cognitive benefit.

People with lots of tangles—that's often women—benefitted the least.

Not everyone benefits equally from amyloid immunotherapy. Several presentations reported that people with a high tangle load clear less plaque, and their downstream biomarkers respond less robustly. Women tend to have more tangles than men at a given stage of disease, producing a sex difference in outcome in some studies. Some speakers offered a glimpse at long-term data that hint removing plaque can stabilize biomarkers and flatten disease trajectories, though the number of people remaining in studies after several years is tiny, hence subject to bias (see next story, Part 7 of this AD/PD series).

Throughout the conference, speakers extolled the historic nature of the meeting, the first AD/PD to be held since the field witnessed unambiguous Phase 3 results that removing amyloid slows disease progression (Dec 2022 conference news). Appropriately enough, that molecule, lecanemab, was developed in Sweden, originally by Lars Lannfelt and colleagues at Uppsala University.

“This meeting marks a milestone—117 years after the discovery of β-amyloid, and 39 years after identifying the polypeptide sequence, we have succeeded in removing it from the brain,” Roger Nitsch of Neurimmune, Switzerland, said in the meeting's opening address. He noted that this now allows scientists to investigate whether the aging brain can restore itself toward healthier function in the absence of plaque, and if so, by how much.

“We are witnessing the validation of the first disease-modifying target for Alzheimer’s disease,” Wagner Zago of Prothena said, adding, “The success of anti-amyloid immunotherapy increases the odds that other therapies will work. We now know that Alzheimer’s disease can be slowed.”

Clinicians and researchers have been desperate for a win, after decades of trying and failing. This conference reverberated with a sense of relief about finally having made what feels like a real start toward disease modification. This story will cover how plaque clearance affects the brain, and what factors determine whether a given person responds.

Threshold Effect? Read from right to left, this diagram shows that positive immunotherapy trials pushed plaque load to below 25 centiloids. Trials falling just short of that were negative, implying that something crucial happens in the brain when plaque is substantially eliminated. [Courtesy of Roger Nitsch.]

Plaque Gone? Downstream Markers Edge Toward Normal

No matter the antibody, removing large amounts of plaque seems to be key for nudging other biomarkers back toward healthier values. Consider data from Lilly’s Trailblazer-Alz4 trial, which compared donanemab and aducanumab treatment head-to-head, without a placebo group. The company had earlier reported that during the first six months, donanemab mopped up 62 centiloids of plaque, four times as much as aducanumab, partly due to donanemab’s faster titration to the effective dose. In addition, plasma p-tau217 fell by a quarter on donanemab (Dec 2022 conference news).

In Gothenburg, Hong Wang of Lilly added six-month data showing that other biomarkers of inflammation and neurodegeneration moved, as well. Plasma p-tau181, which reflects the presence of both plaques and tangles, fell 16 percent in the 66 people on donanemab, while rising 5 percent in the 64 on aducanumab. GFAP, a marker of gliosis, fell 8 percent on donanemab, while rising 9 percent on aducanumab. NfL, believed to be a marker for damaged neurons, rose in both groups, by 11 percent on donanemab and 17 percent on aducanumab. All these group differences were statistically significant. Importantly, all indicated normalization of biomarkers with large plaque removal, but continued progression with only modest removal. About 40 percent of people on donanemab became amyloid-negative by six months, versus a single person on aducanumab.

Wang linked these biomarker changes directly to clearance, showing that across the cohort, people who cleared more plaque lowered their plasma p-tau217, p-tau181, and GFAP by more. Plasma NfL was an exception. It did not correlate with amyloid removal; however, it did weakly correlate with the other plasma markers.

Data from the negative Phase 3 Graduate 1 and 2 studies of gantenerumab paint a similar picture. Roche had previously reported insufficient amyloid clearance in this trial, with participants on drug losing about 53 centiloids over more than two years, short of the expected clearance of 70. Only a quarter of participants became amyloid-negative. Cognitive decline on the CDR-SB and ADAS-Cog 13 nudged down an average of 11 percent, below statistical significance (Dec 2022 conference news). In Gothenburg, Roche’s Janice Smith added MMSE data to this, reporting a similar non-significant slowing of 9 percent on drug.

As with donanemab, plaque removal tracked with downstream markers. Tobias Bittner presented data from Roche’s NeuroToolkit suite of fluid biomarkers. In the two Graduate studies, a total of 293 people on gantenerumab and 269 on placebo donated cerebrospinal fluid. In this pooled CSF subgroup, Aβ42 rose 26 percent with treatment, while p-tau181 and total tau fell 23 and 16 percent, respectively. These changes normalized biomarkers, and were statistically significant. Surprisingly, CSF Aβ40, which fell 7 percent on placebo, fell further, by 17 percent, in those on gantenerumab. The difference was nominally significant, and seemed to be a response to plaque removal, though it is unclear why it happened, Bittner noted.

Likewise, the inflammatory markers GFAP and S100B nudged downward by 5 and 14 percent on drug, while the synaptic markers neurogranin and α-synuclein fell 21 and 15 percent. Both inflammatory and synaptic markers rise in AD, the latter perhaps due to damaged synapses leaking these proteins into interstitial fluid. Meanwhile, the synaptic marker NPTX2 gave puzzling results, falling 19 percent on placebo and 26 percent on gantenerumab, a nominally significant difference. Bitter noted that NPTX2 is a newer marker in the toolkit and is not yet fully understood (see also Mar 2023 news). Finally, the neurodegeneration marker NfL, which rose 20 percent in the placebo group, rose 11 percent on drug.

The scientists also found effects in plasma, which was collected from all participants. As expected, Aβ42, Aβ40, and the Aβ42/40 ratio all rose on gantenerumab. This was likely not an effect of plaque removal, but rather due to antibody binding Aβ in the blood and prolonging its half-life, Bittner said. More telling was plasma p-tau, which does reflect brain pathology. P-tau181 and p-tau217 rose 9 and 13 percent, respectively, on placebo, but fell 16 and 32 percent on drug. Likewise, plasma GFAP rose 13 percent on placebo, and fell 10 percent on drug. There was no treatment effect on plasma NfL, perhaps due to the confounding effects of peripheral production, Bittner noted.

Notably, plasma markers were sensitive to the degree of plaque removal. Participants in Graduate 2 cleared about 10 centiloids less plaque on average than those in Graduate 1. This small difference showed up in blood, with the Graduate 2 cohort displaying a slightly smaller therapeutic effect on all biomarkers, even Aβ. The difference between studies did not show up in CSF because those data were pooled, due to the smaller number of participants. In plasma, the amount of plaque clearance correlated with the change in Aβ42 at r=-0.43, p-tau181 at 0.34, and GFAP at 0.16, again linking cleanup to widespread effects on pathology.

“These are quite robust treatment effects,” Bittner said, adding that this was surprising, given the clinically negative findings in these studies. Future analyses should compare participants’ final biomarker levels with values in healthy age-matched controls, to determine how close to normal they came, Bittner suggested.

Scientists at AD/PD said that even small differences in plaque removal around the clearance threshold appear to matter. Nitsch noted that all positive immunotherapy trials have brought plaque burden below 25 centiloids, whereas negative trials, such as Engage, Graduate 1, and Graduate 2, ended only slightly higher, with average amyloid loads of 35 centiloids or more (see image above). This implies that something important might happen around this threshold, and that near-complete plaque clearance is crucial.

To Christian Haass of Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich, the data validate the connection between amyloid, neuroinflammation, and tau. “The amyloid cascade is no longer a hypothesis,” he said in Gothenburg.

How to Find Likely Responders? Tangles Might Help

Some people clear amyloid faster than others—and have better outcomes. Are there characteristics, such as disease stage or APOE, that might help determine how well a person will respond to amyloid immunotherapy? In Trailblazer-Alz4, APOE genotype made no difference, Wang reported. However, a person’s tangle load at baseline did. People who started out with a lot of tau pathology, defined as a baseline tau PET SUVR of above 1.46, cleared less plaque over six months on donanemab, about 50 centiloids, compared to nearly 70 in the lower-tau subgroups.

This relatively small difference led to a stark effect on plasma biomarkers, with the high-tau subgroup gaining no benefit from donanemab. Their plasma p-tau181 stayed flat, while p-tau217, GFAP, and NfL rose at the same rate as in the aducanumab treatment group. These findings add to the evidence that amyloid removal may help people the most early in disease, before tau pathology takes off.

Wang noted curiously different demographics in the high-tau group than the rest of the cohort. As might be expected, they had more clinically advanced disease and higher baseline biomarkers but, perhaps surprisingly, they also tended to be younger. Curiously high tau PET loads relative to other markers in younger patients have been cropping up in various studies ever since tau tracers came onto the scene. These high-tangle trial participants also included more women. This could be due to women’s greater propensity to accumulate tangles (Aug 2018 conference news; Feb 2019 news; Nov 2019 news).

A similar effect popped up in subgroup analyses from the Graduate gantenerumab trials. Neither age nor APOE genotype affected the primary outcome, Smith reported in Gothenburg. Clinical stage did, with the mild cognitive impairment subgroup reaping slightly more benefit than the mild dementia group. However, that effect was weak, as slicing disease stage a different way, by baseline CDR score, did not show this difference.

Sexist Antibodies?

In contrast, the one characteristic that robustly affected outcomes was sex. Women gained no benefit from gantenerumab removal on any cognitive or functional measure, with their progression lines nearly identical to the placebo group’s. But men taking gantenerumab declined more slowly than did men on placebo—by 16 percent on the CDR-SB, 22 percent on the ADAS-Cog 13, 19 percent on the ADCS-ADL, and 16 percent on the FAQ. All four measures were statistically significant.

What is going on? Smith found no demographic differences between the male and female groups at baseline. They had the same clinical status, with around 55 percent MCI and the rest mild AD. They received the same number of gantenerumab doses and cleared about the same amount of amyloid. However, women in the study started with about 10 centiloids more plaque than men, 100 versus 90. This means they also ended the study further above the amyloid-negative threshold than did men.

Tellingly, perhaps, women also had more tau pathology at baseline in all four brain regions examined. In the two regions with the highest tau PET signal, the medial and lateral temporal lobes, women had SUVRs of 1.54 and 1.46, respectively, to men’s 1.35 and 1.28. Both these values would fall into the “high tau” category in the donanemab Trailblazer-Alz4 study. In their parietal and frontal lobes, women averaged 1.23 and 1.15, below this threshold but still higher than men, who had 1.11 and 1.05, respectively.

An audience member wondered if matching men and women by tangle load would eliminate the sex difference. Smith said the numbers in this substudy were too low to parse the data that way, but agreed it would be worth looking at. She also suggested exploring whether co-morbidities in women might contribute to their lack of response to immunotherapy. If the sex difference is solely due to tangle load, it would imply that anti-amyloid treatment might have to start sooner in women than men, placing even more importance on early detection of AD pathology in the clinic.

Frederik Barkhof of University College London reported the overall tau PET findings from the Graduate studies, not broken down by sex. Only 180 participants entered this substudy, and more than half dropped out, with 48 people on gantenerumab and 29 on placebo reaching the two-year mark. In the whole tau PET cohort, tangle load at baseline was 1.47 in the medial temporal lobe and 1.46 in the lateral temporal load, both above the “high-tau” threshold identified in the donanemab program. Barkhof did not discuss if this high baseline tangle load contributed to gantenerumab’s weak clinical effect in Phase 3.

A larger analysis from Mark Mintun of Eli Lilly jibed with his findings, though. Mintun examined data from positive trials of aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab to learn which participant characteristics predicted who would respond best. He found no consistent difference by APOE genotype or disease stage. However, the degree of amyloid clearance mattered; it determined the strength of the brake on tau pathology. In the donanemab Phase 2 trial, people who became amyloid-negative had less tangle accumulation during the trial than did those with only partial plaque clearance. In addition, amyloid removal in general correlated roughly linearly with a drop in p-tau.

Baseline tangle pathology also seemed to matter, Mintun added, referencing Wang’s data on downstream biomarkers stalling in the high-tau subgroup. This effect of baseline tangle load was independent of the amount of plaque clearance. In other words, even if plaques were cleared to below threshold in a person who started with a high tangle load, their downstream biomarkers barely budged. Mintun did not break down data by sex. The field urgently needs more data on how baseline tangles affect outcomes, he concluded.

Others have speculated that after tau pathology takes off in the cortex, Alzheimer’s disease will progress independently of amyloid. Thus, plaque clearance at that stage would do little good. This inflection point has been dubbed the “ca-tau-strophe” by Keith Johnson at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.

Kildare 2-11 Clare 2-10

Roisin Byrne grabbed a majestic haul of 0-10 at Parnell Park as Kildare claimed the Lidl NFL Division 3 crown - and a spot in next year’s Division 2 - with a thrilling extra-time win over Clare.

Despite temporarily losing Grainne Kenneally to a yellow card with less than two minutes gone, the Lilywhites enjoyed a whirlwind start. The in-form Roisin Byrne kicked a brace of points from play, before Neasa Dooley brilliantly converted a 10th minute penalty after Trina Duggan had been fouled inside the square.

Unanswered scores from Fidelma Marrinan (two) and midfielder Aisling Reidy helped Clare to settle into the action, but Kildare ultimately led 1-2 to 0-3 at the end of a low-scoring opening half.

Chloe Moloney and Byrne traded pointed frees at either end when the play resumed, before Sarsfields ace Byrne registered two more points in response to Reidy’s second of the game. While Clare breathed a sigh of relief when an Ellen Dowling goal was ruled for over carrying, Kildare eventually scored another goal when captain Grace Clifford palmed home in the 43rd minute.

This left the Lilywhites with a commanding six-point buffer, 2-5 to 0-5, entering the final-quarter, but a brace of Marrinan frees did keep the Clare challenge alive. Although Kildare remained on course for victory, an instinctive three-point finish from Clare substitute Laura Griffey on 56 minutes brought the gap back down to the bare minimum.

A nerveless Marrinan free then restored parity at 1-10 to 2-7 moments later to make sure an additional 20 minutes was needed to produce a winner from this tie.

Roisin Byrne’s seventh point of the day edged Kildare back in the ascendancy, but Clare were two points to the good, 2-10 to 2-8, at the midway stage in extra-time as a result of Marrinan’s goal from a tight left-hand angle.

The sin-binning of Dooley on 68 minutes also presented them with a numerical advantage, but their Leinster rivals once again dug deep with 14 players as the exceptional Byrne kicked three points without reply to sensationally move Kildare back in front.

Even though Kildare were to finish the game with 13 after Roisin Forde and Lara Gilbert received later yellow cards, Diane O’Hora’s charges held out in a tense finale.

Scorers for Kildare: R Byrne 0-10 (5f), N Dooley (pen), G Clifford 1-0 each, E Dowling 0-1.

After overcoming Galway a week previously, Dublin seized control in the second half with Jamie Conroy’s 49th-minute goal proving the critical score on the day.

With the breeze at their backs, the hosts opened up brightly through early scores from Diarmuid Ó Dúlaing and James O’Brien and moved three points clear by the 9th minute thanks to Conal Ó Riain and Jamie Conroy.

Wexford stayed in contention through two points apiece from Jack Redmond and Cian Byrne with another score from the influential Ó Riain edging Dublin 0-6 to 0-4 by the end of the first quarter.

The Dubs doubled that advantage through a brace of Ó Dúlaing frees and an Ollie Gaffney score but a series of poor wides towards the end of the half undermined their dominance.

Colum Fitzgerald availed of an error from Dublin netminder Adam Langan to trim his team’s deficit before an Ó Dúlaing free ensured the hosts entered the break with a marginal 0-10 to 0-7 lead.

The hosts proved far more clinical upon the restart as Brendan Kenny tagged on two excellent points while Wexford’s radar was amiss as they struck some soul-destroying wides at the opposite end.

Ó Dúlaing continued to enhance Dublin’s superiority from placed balls and the contest was effectively settled when Conroy latched onto Seán Gallagher’s delivery before firing emphatically beyond Derry Mahon from eight yards.

The contest petered out from that juncture with the classy O’Brien scoring the point of the game in added time to complete a comfortable eight-point success for Dublin.

Scorers – Dublin: D O Dúlaing 0-9 (7f, 1 ‘65’), J Conroy 1-2, J O’Brien 0-3, C Ó Riain, O Gaffney, B Kenny 0-2 each. Wexford: C Byrne 0-5 (3f), J Redmond 0-3 (1f), C Foley (f), D Carley, C Fitzgerald, JJ Twamley, S O’Hagan, S Roche, T Brohan 0-1 apiece.

https://www.nature.com/articles/d42473-020-00399-z,Aiming for higher ambition: the Roche approach to cracking the code of cancer,"Advances in technology are reshaping healthcare, offering many patients the means to track their own health and giving researchers the tools to gain deeper insights into the causes of cancer and its management. As patients become more knowledgeable, informed and tech savvy, the expectation for innovative and effective treatments increases. However, there is still a need to improve the quality of care in general. Patient outcomes can vary because availability and access to innovative and personalised healthcare is fragmented across countries and healthcare systems; this is due to knowledge gaps as well as a lack of infrastructure and healthcare system funding. We need profound transformation of healthcare systems, on a global scale, to meet these demands and improve patient care.

We see the challenges facing physicians at each stage of care delivery. They are typified by incomplete information at diagnosis, suboptimal access to, or limited awareness of, treatment options, and delayed or incomplete patient monitoring. Although technological advances have resulted in rapid increases in the volume of comprehensive medical information available to clinicians, this has also resulted in more complex decision making. To illustrate the point, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform reports that more than 12,000 clinical trials were initiated in Europe in 2019, and more than 6,000 clinical practice guidelines were published on PubMed since 2015. A new approach is needed to support integration of the latest evidence into clinical decision-making and ensure that healthcare professionals (HCPs) are able to deliver the best care possible for every patient.

Shaping the future of care in oncology

At Roche, our vision for the future is personalised healthcare, a patient-centric approach to delivering value-based, outcome-driven healthcare. Personalised healthcare has two key aims: (1) rapid access to treatment and enhanced patient care (2) to increase the speed and efficiency of research and development (R&D). Personalised healthcare is centred on a continuous cycle of insight generation, driven by data, technology and advanced analytics (Fig. 1). Large-scale data sets are available from many sources, including imaging, genomics, clinical trials, electronic health records, wearables, apps and lifestyle. Technology and advanced analytics provide the tools needed to derive meaningful, actionable insights from these data. In addition to clinical trials, real-world data can also inform R&D, shape clinical practice and improve patient outcomes.

Figure 1. The vision of personalised healthcare: data, technology and analytics provide deeper insights into disease to accelerate research and development and improve patient outcomes.

Advanced technology

The implementation of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has improved our understanding of cancer biology and opened up new ways of diagnosing and treating cancer; we can use NGS to detect the genomic alterations driving tumour development and provide insights to inform tailored care plans, including targeted treatment and immunotherapy (Fig. 2). Through comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) using NGS, we can analyse hundreds of cancer-related genes and determine the specific genomic profile of an individual tumour. The Roche CGP portfolio spans both research and clinical decision-making, with the AVENIO family of NGS oncology assays available for use in research applications and services from Foundation Medicine, a molecular information company headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US, for identifying clinically relevant genomic alterations and expanding patients’ potential treatment options. The NAVIFY® Mutation Profiler (a clinical NGS reporting solution) and upcoming decentralised solutions combining the AVENIO workflow and Foundation Medicine platform provide data and clinical decision support.

Foundation Medicine has developed the capability for high-throughput NGS analysis of genomic alterations covering more than 300 cancer-related genes. FoundationOne CDx® is the first United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved tissue-based broad companion diagnostic that is clinically and analytically validated for all solid tumours. The FoundationOne® Liquid biopsy assay was introduced to open up the opportunities for CGP beyond tissue-based testing. It is a minimally invasive blood-based assay, utilising circulating tumour DNA in blood samples to identify genomic alterations that can inform clinical care.

Foundation Medicine is expanding its liquid biopsy services to look beyond individual genes and genomic drivers. The genomic signatures, tumour mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and loss of heterozygosity, are becoming more relevant in guiding cancer immunotherapy and targeted treatment options and are part of the Foundation Medicine services. Future potential applications of liquid biopsy will address needs across the full spectrum of the patient journey in oncology: screening, minimal residual disease (MRD) detection, early detection of relapse, systemic treatment initiation and monitoring of response. Through collaborations with Lexent Bio, a precision oncology company that is part of Foundation Medicine, and Natera, a genetic testing company headquartered in San Carlos, California, US, we are seeking to complement current services by co-developing novel patient monitoring and response assessment platforms. Platforms in development utilise whole genome/exome sequencing information and DNA methylation analysis to identify patients who are at higher risk of progression, assess MRD, and detect evidence of relapse, to enable earlier intervention and improve patient outcomes.

Clinical trial designs

Molecular and genomic profiling has consolidated our understanding of cancer as a genetic disease. With the discovery of oncogenic drivers, cancer is being fragmented into molecular subtypes against which we can develop targeted therapies. This change in how we approach cancer treatment has triggered rapid evolution of drug development processes within the field of oncology. We are increasingly detecting these oncogenic drivers across multiple tumour types, resulting in more complex ‘tumour-agnostic’ or ‘histology-independent’ trials that maximise screening efforts and resource use, and enable exploration of molecular signatures across multiple cancer histologies (Fig. 3). CGP can support the optimisation of such trial designs by aiding patient selection and stratification and longitudinal monitoring of biomarkers. The biomarker-driven approach of basket and umbrella trials is proving particularly beneficial for unlocking new personalised treatments for tumours with low-prevalence genomic alterations and rare cancers with high unmet medical need.

Figure 3. Evolving clinical trial designs to support development of precision oncology. (Adapted from Dickson, D. et al., 20205)

Through a common protocol, basket trials enrol patients with multiple tumour types sharing a specific molecular alteration. The VE-Basket trial [NCT01524978] is a phase II basket trial evaluating early signals of vemurafenib activity in patients with non-melanoma cancers harbouring BRAF V600 mutations. The initial design defined six cohorts with prespecified cancers. A seventh cohort permitted enrolment of patients with any other cancer type, with the opportunity for additional analysis cohorts if sufficient numbers of patients were enrolled1. This flexibility resulted in two additional cohorts, including one for patients with Erdheim–Chester disease (EDC) or Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis. Ultimately, this study resulted in vemurafenib becoming the first FDA-approved treatment for ECD, a rare cancer of the blood associated with very limited life expectancies; vemurafenib also received an orphan designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in this indication.

Cancer of unknown primary origin (CUP) has a high unmet medical need; patients are typically treated with chemotherapy and prognosis is very poor, with median survival of less than one year2. CUPISCO [NCT03498521] is an umbrella trial in patients with CUP, which is using Foundation Medicine liquid biopsy and tissue assays to determine a comprehensive genomic profile of each patient’s tumour3. A molecular tumour board, comprising pathologists, CUP specialists and the treating oncologist, matches this profile to the most appropriate treatment, giving patients access to targeted therapies, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. CUPISCO has the potential to be practice changing, by accelerating the development of more effective treatment strategies, increasing our understanding of the disease, improving access to personalised cancer treatment and informing future development of new drugs for CUP. The MORPHEUS trial is evolving the umbrella trial design to inform future personalised cancer treatments based on immune signatures or biomarkers. MORPHEUS is a suite of phase Ib trials designed to generate signal-seeking data versus standard of care for immunotherapy combinations across a broad range of cancers, and to support cross-indication learnings that will ultimately improve patient outcomes. Tissue biopsies and serial blood tests allow longitudinal assessment of biomarkers for response and resistance, and surrogate biomarkers of efficacy.

Our continuing efforts in this field can also been seen in the Blood First Assay Screening Trial [BFAST; NCT03178552] and the MyPathway trial [NCT02091141]. In BFAST, the relationship between blood-based biomarkers and the clinical activity of several therapies (atezolizumab, alectinib, entrectinib, vemurafenib and cobimetinib) is being evaluated in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)4. BFAST overcomes the traditional challenges of tissue collection by using the FoundationOne Liquid biopsy assay. The modular trial design also allows new treatment cohorts to be added, as new biomarker information becomes available, and for patients lacking actionable biomarkers to be enrolled into a real-world data cohort. In MyPathway, again, several therapies (trastuzumab/pertuzumab, erlotinib, vemurafenib/cobimetinib, vismodegib, alectinib and atezolizumab) are being evaluated in patients with advanced solid tumours and either mutations or gene expression abnormalities that are predictive of response to one of the therapies being investigated.

Through biomarker-driven trials, the validity of targeting oncogenic drivers across tumour types has been demonstrated. FDA and EMA approvals of larotrectinib (for NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours) and entrectinib (for NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours and ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC) were possible by pooling data and performing an integrated analysis across three phase I/II trials: LOXO-TRK-14001 [NCT02122913], SCOUT [NCT02637687], and NAVIGATE [NCT02576431]; and ALKA-372-001 [EudraCT 2012-000148-88], STARTRK-1 [NCT02097810], and STARTRK-2 [NCT02568267], respectively6,7,8. Both drug approvals were accelerated due to the high unmet need in these patient populations, and relied on consultation with regulatory authorities due to the novel data sets submitted. More recently, pembrolizumab was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumours harbouring either MSI-high (KEYNOTE–177 [NCT02563002]) or TMB-high (KEYNOTE-158 [NCT02628067]) genomic alterations (currently no EMA approval in these indications)9.

The pace of discovery of new tumour-agnostic treatments is accelerating (Fig. 4) and we need to think now about how to identify patients with rare molecular alterations who may benefit and put diagnostic and data infrastructures in place to ensure that future developments in this field are sustainable. Roche recently committed to the development of pralsetinib, an investigational tumour-agnostic drug under evaluation for the treatment of patients with RET-altered NSCLC, thyroid cancer and other solid tumours. In entering into this collaboration with Blueprint Medicines, a biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Roche is affirming its commitment to tumour-agnostic drug development.

Unlocking the potential of real-world evidence

As clinical trial designs have been evolving, so too have the sources of real-world data and our ability to derive meaningful insights (Fig. 5). Using real-world data, we can better understand patients and their disease as well as the long-term outcomes and impact of treatment. We can also facilitate more effective, value-based reimbursement and rapid access to treatment, and fulfil post-approval evidence generation commitments.

Figure 5. Co-evolution of clinical trials and real-world data. RCT, randomised controlled trial; RWE, real-world evidence.

Real-world data is collected routinely during care delivery and reflects real-life clinical practice. However, due to the lack of standardisation, traditional sources (electronic health records, insurance claims databases, disease and product registries and observational/cohort studies) contain heterogeneous data that are difficult to access, analyse and interpret. We, and many other stakeholders, are working to strengthen data infrastructures and make data more accessible, standardised and inter-operable so that it can be used efficiently. Advances in analytics and technology are also creating new sources of real-world data (wearables, apps and genomics). At Roche, we are creating large-scale multimodal data sets using longitudinal patient-level data from all these sources. Advanced analytics, such as machine learning algorithms, can then be used to derive new insights into disease and treatment. Such algorithms are particularly useful in the field of medical imaging to automate quantification of tumour burden.

CGP has advanced our understanding of genomic alterations and their role in driving cancer, but the relationship between genomic alterations and clinical outcome is only beginning to emerge. A major step in unlocking the potential of real-world data was taken with the creation of the clinico-genomic database, a research platform linking genomic profiling data from Foundation Medicine with real-world clinical data from the electronic health record platform from Flatiron Health, a healthcare technology company based in New York, US. The database currently contains more than 58,000 clinico-genomic profiles and is continuing to grow and evolve as new data are added. Real-world evidence generated from this database will aid identification of genomic profiles that do / do not respond well to treatments, identify and validate new biomarkers, and inform the design of clinical trials through better characterisation and definition of patient populations10.

We are also pioneering a shareable, global real-world data set. This will include tumour genomic profiles as well as details on patient history, molecular testing, factors influencing treatment decisions and patient outcomes. The large-scale accessible data set will help to accelerate R&D by providing insights on the effectiveness of personalised cancer treatments, inform clinical decision-making and support access and reimbursement discussions to bring new treatments to patients more quickly. Aside from the direct value of the data itself, learnings from the logistics of this initiative will help to guide healthcare systems and policy makers on the specific barriers to cross-border data sharing and the value of core data variables in deriving clinically meaningful information. Of particular interest are the R&D efficiencies that can be gained through combining real-world data and technology. Roche, together with other industry partners, recently took part in an EMA-led ‘Workshop on the role of registries in the monitoring of cancer therapies based on genetic and molecular features’. Discussions focussed on the type and quality of real-world data that could be generated to meet regulatory requirements and potential sources of these data, including registries. Open and early dialogue between regulators and all parties involved was considered essential to assess the feasibility of obtaining adequate data from individual registry-based studies.

Roche has recently initiated a prospective clinico–genomic registry [NCT04180176] for patients with advanced NSCLC or extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer planning to start standard-of-care treatment at clinics within the Flatiron Health network. The multi-stakeholder platform will collect clinical data from electronic health records and link real-world tumour tissue genomic profiling, digital imaging and outcomes data to longitudinal blood genomic profiling. Results of the study will show the feasibility of this scalable, prospective approach and provide insights into the relationship between tumour biomarkers and real-world clinical outcomes.

Personalised cancer treatment

Many regulatory authorities are keen to work with the new trial designs, clinical endpoints and evidence sources utilised in developing treatments for rare molecularly defined populations, including tumour-agnostic drugs. For drugs that receive conditional approvals from regulatory authorities, companies make a post-approval commitment to provide additional data to support evidence submitted at filing, but health technology assessments of such drugs are heterogeneous and lead to differing reimbursement statuses, which challenges broad patient access11. To ensure improved patient access, we need to foster greater awareness of the unique nature of targeted and tumour-agnostic therapies among health technology assessment bodies, and partner with them to develop modified appraisal systems for evaluating novel data and endpoints and discuss value frameworks for diagnostic solutions.

Across Europe and North America, countries are starting to put policies in place to integrate real-world data into health technology assessments. In Italy the Technical and Scientific committee (CTS) – which is part of the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA), a government body – was set up to facilitate rapid access to life-changing drugs. The CTS uses a new algorithm to evaluate non-randomised controlled trial data and clinical endpoints, such as quality of life and tumour response. The ‘highly specialised technology’ pathway serves a similar purpose for The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, a UK government body.

Reimbursement for two Roche molecules, approved by the FDA and EMA for NSCLC treatment (atezolizumab for second-line treatment in all subpopulations; alectinib for second-line treatment of patients with ALK+ disease), was achieved using real-world data from the Flatiron database. Without the insights from real-world data to support survival benefits and generate a retrospective external control arm, respectively, it would have been much more challenging to reach accelerated reimbursement decisions and bring these treatments to patients so quickly. Future hybrid clinical trial designs could incorporate prospective external real-world data controls, to enable smaller and more efficient clinical studies, enable new models of risk-sharing agreements with payers and reduce patient exposure to placebo treatments.

Future directions

High throughput ‘omics’ technologies show promise in assessing response to investigational drugs and could transform the way we monitor disease, allowing physicians to make faster decisions and adapt treatment or dosage as needed. Real-time symptom reporting is associated with improved survival and quality of life compared with usual care in patients receiving treatment for advanced cancer12. Roche and Kaiku Health, a health data company headquartered in Helsinki, have developed an app for patients receiving cancer immunotherapy that allows them to report symptoms directly. Self-reporting of symptoms not only allows healthcare professionals to rapidly triage treatment-related symptoms and optimise treatment plans, but also empowers patients to take a more active role in managing their symptoms. A pilot study conducted at ten hospitals showed promising feedback from physicians, nurses and patients13.

Automated clinical imaging analytics can improve the efficiency of R&D by unlocking insights from data collected during clinical trials, and we are partnering with technology companies to accelerate development in this field. Clinical decision support solutions are of the utmost importance for physicians faced with increasing volumes of information on which to base care plans. Although multidisciplinary tumour boards are often used to facilitate decision-making and optimise cancer care, they can be inefficient and challenging to organise. The NAVIFY® tumour board aims to make this multidisciplinary approach more efficient by integrating patient data from multiple sources (tissue samples/slides, laboratory tests, imaging, biopsies and genomic tests) to generate a complete patient overview presented on a single patient dashboard. Early indications of the impact of NAVIFY show a 53% reduction in case preparation time for oncologists treating patients with breast cancer14.

Collaborative approaches

Our vision of personalised healthcare may be ambitious, but driven by insights from data, technology and advanced analytics, and putting the patient at the centre of care, we have already made huge leaps in deepening our understanding of cancer biology and more efficient ways to develop effective cancer therapies. At Roche, we recognise that if the full potential of personalised healthcare is going to be realised we need to think beyond diagnostics and drugs, and play a leading role in creating integrated solutions with clinical value that healthcare systems can implement. We are investing significant resources into improving global healthcare by focussing on patient-centric solutions, building quality standards for real-world data, and connecting with healthcare systems to ensure infrastructures are in place to facilitate fast access to personalised cancer care. There is no single approach to personalised healthcare; it must accommodate the diversity of healthcare systems across the globe. Roche is forming partnerships, and working with patients, payers, health technology assessment bodies, regulators, governments and healthcare providers, to build the clinical, technological and administrative infrastructures necessary to improve cancer care and patient outcomes on a global scale.","['Marlene Thomas', 'F.

Ben Healy’s progress had been apparent all Spring, but the true breakout display came at the Amstel Gold Race, where the Irishman took second place behind Tadej Pogačar after dropping his old teammate Tom Pidcock in the finale.

The three podium finishers were all part of a move that went clear with some 90km remaining, and Healy and Pidcock were the last men standing when Pogacar began running through his scales in earnest on the Eyserbosweg.

Pogacar overwhelmed Healy and Pidcock on the Keutenberg with 29km to go, but the pair combined to give chase over the other side. After Pidcock tried and failed to shake off Healy on the final haul up the Cauberg, the EF Education-EasyPost rider responded in kind by distancing him on the Geulhemmerberg.

“I knew I had good legs, and I knew I had to ride a smart race to finish second behind Pogacar today,” Healy said afterwards. “That’s what I did, and it paid off in the end.”

Indeed, Healy closed to within 20 seconds of Pogacar shortly after his late attack, though the Slovenian pulled away again soon afterwards. The slipstream afforded to Pogacar by the race director’s car at that moment drew the understandable frustration of EF manager Jonathan Vaughters, though that will likely be tempered by satisfaction at Healy’s display.

“The gap came down when I attacked a little bit, but he was clearly holding something in reserve. But it was nice all the same,” said Healy, who came home 38 seconds down on Pogacar.

“It was pretty surreal. When you’re racing with a couple of the best riders in the world and when you’re able to follow them, you think, ‘Whoa, the legs must be good today.' And then when I dropped Tom as well, it was a pretty surreal moment.”

The 22-year-old started his season with some strong displays at the Challenge Mallorca before picking up two wins on Italian roads, landing the GP Industria & Artigianato di Larciano and a stage of the Settimana Coppi e Bartali.

After placing fifth at the Région Pays de la Loire Tour, Healy went on take second behind Dorian Godon at Brabantse Pijl in midweek, before shining at WorldTour level on Sunday. With Neilson Powless still in the main peloton, Healy had a reason to contribute sparingly when the decisive move began to take shape with 90km to go.

“I think I was quietly confident,” Healy said of his mindset. “I rode a very aggressive race at Brabantse but with a few bigger names here, I knew I’d get the luxury of maybe missing a few turns – which is what I did, and it played to my advantage in the end.”

Healy turned professional with EF last year after two seasons with Trinity Racing. His under-23 career yielded stage wins at the Tour de l’Avenir, the Ronde de l’Isard and the Baby Giro, and he is now beginning to show an aptitude for the big occasion as a professional.

“Amstel is something that definitely suits me, and the wet, rainy days are something I also like,” said Healy, who will line up among the men to watch at La Flèche Wallonne and Liège-Bastogne-Liège.

His display on Sunday, however, was less of a surprise to man who came home behind him in third place.

“I know how strong Ben is, I raced with him at Trinity when I was younger and he helped me win the Baby Giro, so I know how good he is,” Pidcock said. “Maybe it’s not a surprise to me, but it’s nice to see him at the front as well.”",[],

https://www.thedailybeast.com/la-roche-posay-effaclar-acne-products-review,This Acne Treatment Single-Handedly Cleared My Milia Bumps,"Scouted selects products independently. If you purchase something from our posts, we may earn a small commission.

I have struggled with milia my whole life—I’m pretty sure it's from the dirty and sweaty headbands I would wear for softball games and never washed, but we won’t talk about that. In case you’re not familiar with milia, it’s a benign skin condition that results in small white bumps. It’s often caused by dead skin, sebum, and flakes becoming trapped in the pores, but can also stem from using comodogenic products that clog the pores.

On top of milia, I also struggled with picking at my acne instead of treating it properly and leaving it alone (even though I know better!) because I was never able to find a way to get rid of the stubborn acne deposits under my skin, especially on my forehead. On day, I was scurrying through Target as one does, when I came across a bundle of the La Roche-Posay Cleanser, Toner, and Effacla Set. I had seen the Effaclar treatments on TikTok before, but was skeptical to give it a try since it was $30 for the one 0.7 fl oz tube. But because the bundle was $30, I decided to pick it up and give it a try.

It turns out this acne and pore de-clogging formula was worth every penny and more. This spot treatment helped reduce acne blemishes, pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads, and because it’s formulated with 5.5% micronized benzoyl peroxide and micro-exfoliating lipo-hydroxy acid, it gently exfoliates.

I read online that you could use it as an all over treatment (I don’t reccomend this for those with sensitive skin though), which is exactly what I did, and within 10 days I saw those pesky white bumps start to fade. Flash forward to a month later, and they’re virtually gone. If you’ve been looking for a way to treat congested pores, stubborn blackheads, and milia without extractions or a visit to the derm, I can’t reccomend La Roche-Posay’s Effaclar skincare line enough.

https://www.msn.com/en-ie/sports/gaa/roisin-byrne-stars-as-kildare-claim-extra-time-thriller-over-clare/ar-AA19WSLN,Roisin Byrne stars as Kildare claim extra time thriller over Clare,"© Provided by Irish Examiner

Kildare 2-11 Clare 2-10

Kildare manager Diane O’Hora struggled to process this sensational Lidl NFL Division 3 Final where the Lilywhites edged Clare after extra-time in a thriller.

It was their second time reaching this decider in three years and Kildare finally prevailed for their maiden victory, to secure their place in Division 2 for next year.

Clare were relegated from the second tier in 2022 and despite a magnificent showing at Parnell Park, they failed to return at the first time of asking.

Roisin Byrne scored 0-10 and while O’Hora tried to comprehend the frantic match she had just witnessed, she knew her players had put in a huge effort.

“I’m absolutely delighted. It’s nearly hard to take in that game,” said O’Hora.

“We were changing players, putting them back on the field, waiting for the free-kicks. Which if it goes to extra-time and there’s still no result, it is free-kicks from the 21 yard line. That was going to be the next stage of the game. We were thinking that was happening.

“I was just talking to Sean Finnegan there, he was the manager last year and he said: ‘how did you win a game, lose a game, win it, lose it and then come back to win it again?’

“I said: ‘I don’t know, I don’t have an answer just yet for that!’ We have a lot to work on in terms of discipline but I’m absolutely over the moon and proud of the girls.”

Kildare were only 1-2 to 0-3 ahead at the end of a low-scoring first half with Neasa Dooley finding the net from a penalty. Grace Clifford’s goal pushed Kildare further in front but Clare battled back and a Fidelma Marrinan free sent the game to extra-time.

Clare were 2-10 to 2-8 ahead at half-time in extra-time before Byrne turned on the style again and Clare were left to rue a missed opportunity.

“The result is disappointing but I think we’ll take a lot from the performance. We’re all very proud of them, definitely,” said Clare manager Wayne Freeman.

“No doubt the result is hard to take. We were probably the better team, I’d say, overall. The goal chances in the first half, we should have wrapped them up. Probably should have been ten points up at half-time and instead we were behind.

“We were fighting and we showed a lot of character. Played a lot of good football but we didn't manage the game well towards the end and that’s why we got caught.

“These games are very tight and Roisin (Byrne) kicked a cracker of a free to put them a point up and then obviously we missed a chance at the end to bring it to kicks but we’ll take a lot out of it.”

Scorers for Kildare: R Byrne 0-10 (5f), N Dooley (pen), G Clifford 1-0 each, E Dowling 0-1.

Scorers for Clare: F Marrinan 1-6 (0-5f), L Griffey 1-0, A Reidy 0-2, C Moloney (f), C Blake 0-1 each.

KILDARE: M Hulgraine; L Burke, L Lenehan, G Kenneally; L Gilbert, R Sargent, S Munnelly; G Clifford, A Rattigan; C Sullivan, R Byrne, T Duggan; E Dowling, N Dooley, L Curran.

Two-Way Immersion (TWI)—recognized nationally as the most effective approach to bilingual eduction—blends native English speaking students with peers who are native in another language. With more than 20% of the U.S. population speaking a language other than English at home, multiple approaches to educating students with limited English proficiency exist. Typically, these students are provided supplemental assistance focused on English language development. TWI differs from such approaches in two key ways.

TWI supports bilingualism, biliteracy, and pluriculturalism. English learners become fluent in both English and their native language.

TWI also supports bilingualism and biliteracy for native English speakers. English language learners are not separated from their native English speaking classmates, instead, all students serve as language models for one another, and they become bilingual together.

TWI prepares all student participants to become bilingual and biliterate citizens in our increasingly global world, where communication skills can serve to promote solidarity and appreciation for diversity.",[],

https://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/cardinal-roche-to-german-bishops,Cardinal Roche to German bishops: ‘Nein’ to regular lay baptisms and preaching at Mass,"The prefect for the Vatican’s Dicastery for Divine Worship has objected to plans for regular lay baptisms and lay preaching at Masses endorsed by Germany’s controversial “synodal way.”

Cardinal Arthur Roche, pictured on Aug. 28, 2022. © Mazur/cbcew.org.uk.

Cardinal Arthur Roche made his objections known in a letter to German bishops’ conference chairman Bishop Georg Bätzing, the official news website of the Catholic Church in Germany reported March 30.

Katholisch.de said that it had seen the letter, which had not been published by the Vatican or the German bishops’ conference at press time.

The synodal way — a three-year initiative bringing together German bishops and select lay people to discuss changes to Church teaching and practice — formally ended March 11 after approving a document entitled “Proclamation of the Gospel by lay people in word and sacrament.”

The text called on the German bishops’ conference to develop regulations “for the qualification and commissioning of lay men and women to lead the celebration of baptism.”

It also asked German bishops to “draw up a particular norm and obtain permission for this from the Holy See, according to which the homily can also be taken over in Eucharistic celebrations on Sundays and feast days by theologically and spiritually qualified faithful commissioned by the bishop.”

Share The Pillar

According to katholisch.de, Cardinal Roche referred in his letter to canon law, which says that bishops, priests, or deacons are the “ordinary ministers” of baptism, and that exceptions can only be made when they are “absent or impeded,” or “in a case of necessity.”

The prefect of the Dicastery for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments reportedly said that the exceptions applied when an ordinary minister could not be found within a month.

He said that such conditions “do not seem to exist in any diocese in the area of ​​the German bishops’ conference, based on the data from the papal yearbook on the clergy available.”

He added that “in any case, there were still enough ordained ministers to cope with the annual number of baptisms in the German dioceses, which is in decline.”

Regarding lay preaching, the cardinal also referred to canon law, which says that “lay persons can be permitted to preach in a church or oratory, if necessity requires it in certain circumstances or it seems advantageous in particular cases,” but the homily “is reserved to a priest or deacon.”

“This is not an exclusion of the laity,” Cardinal Roche wrote, “nor is it, of course, a denial of the right and duty of every baptized person, male or female, to proclaim the Gospel, but rather a confirmation of the specificity of this form of proclamation, which is the homily.”

He suggested that “misunderstandings about the figure and identity of the priest” could “arise in the consciousness of the Christian community” if lay people preached at Mass.

He stressed that this did not mean that there were inequalities among baptized Catholics, but rather “that there are discernments made by the Spirit, which produces different charisms that are different and complementary.”

“Word and sacrament are inseparable realities, and inasmuch as they are not merely formal expressions of the exercise of sacra potestas [sacred power], they are neither separable nor can they be separable.”

The cardinal highlighted Pope Francis’ opening in 2021 of the ministries of lector and acolyte to women.

“This openness offers lay people the opportunity to engage in meaningful liturgical ministry in the exercise of the ministry of lector and acolyte,” he wrote, expressing interest in “how this possibility was received in the dioceses in Germany.”

Leave a comment

Both lay homilies and baptisms are already an established practice in some German dioceses. Katholisch.de noted that a 1999 document set out conditions for lay preaching at Masses in the Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart. Last October, the diocese’s current Bishop Gebhard Fürst issued a decree permitting lay theologians to preside at baptisms.

Bishop Franz-Josef Overbeck of Essen formally commissioned lay people to administer baptisms in March 2022.

Cardinal Roche’s letter is the latest in a long line of Vatican interventions concerning the synodal way.

It comes little more than two weeks after Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin indicated that the Vatican opposed a synodal way resolution supporting blessings for same-sex unions in churches.

He told reporters on the sidelines of an event in Rome March 13 that “the Holy See has already expressed itself very clearly with the document of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith.” He was referring to the 2021 Vatican declaration that “the Church does not have, and cannot have, the power to bless unions of persons of the same sex.”

Cardinal Roche reportedly ended his letter to Bishop Bätzing by underlining that the Vatican remained open to dialogue.

A spokesman for Germany’s bishops’ conference told katholisch.de: “We realize that the dicastery’s letter describes the current situation on the issues discussed. At the end, there is an invitation to further dialogue, which we are happy to accept. It’s good that we’re staying in touch with Rome in this way.”

A spokeswoman for the powerful lay Central Committee of German Catholics (ZdK) told the website that the Vatican letter was a welcome sign of Rome’s interest in the consequences of the synodal way in Germany.

“Talks in Rome are overdue and are in the heartfelt interest of Catholic civil society in this country,” said Britta Baas.

She added: “In just a few years, no one will be able to seriously oppose lay sermons and baptisms by lay people if the Church still wants to have meaning for the local people. We already have a glaring shortage of priests.”

Up to 80% of people with this type of HCC experience disease recurrence, at which point they are faced with poorer prognosis and shorter survival 2

These data will be presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2023 and included in the official press programme





Basel, 16 April 2023 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today new data from the Phase III IMbrave050 study that show Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) plus Avastin® (bevacizumab) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in recurrence-free survival (RFS) in people with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at high risk of disease recurrence following liver resection or ablation with curative intent.2

“Four out of five people with HCC who receive surgery with curative intent may still see their cancer return. Thus, an urgent need exists for adjuvant treatments to prevent early recurrence and improve survival rates,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “With Tecentriq plus Avastin already a standard of care in unresectable HCC, we are pleased with the potential of these results and look forward to seeing more mature data.”

The Tecentriq investigational combination reduced the risk of cancer returning by 28%, compared with active surveillance, at a median follow-up of 17.4 months (independent review facility [IRF]-RFS hazard ratio [HR]=0.72, 95% CI: 0.56-0.93; P=0.0120).1 The IRF-RFS findings were generally consistent across clinical subgroups. Overall Survival (OS), a key secondary endpoint, was immature (7% event-rate) at the time of data analysis. The safety data for Tecentriq plus Avastin were consistent with the well-established safety profile of each therapeutic treatment and with the underlying disease.1

The late-breaking data will be presented at the AACR Annual Meeting 2023 and have been included as part of the official press programme. Discussions with health authorities are ongoing and follow-up will continue for the final RFS data and more mature OS data at the next planned analysis.

The IMbrave050 study is part of Roche’s overall commitment to drive fundamental treatment change and improve outcomes for people living with liver cancer. Tecentriq plus Avastin was the first treatment in over a decade to significantly improve OS over the existing standard of care, based on data from the IMbrave150 study.3 The Tecentriq combination quickly became a standard of care in unresectable HCC and is clearly defined as a preferred front-line treatment in multiple international clinical guidelines.

About the IMbrave050 study

IMbrave050 is a Phase III global, multicentre, open-label, randomised study evaluating the efficacy and safety of adjuvant Tecentriq plus Avastin, compared with active surveillance, in people with HCC at high risk of recurrence (determined by the size and number of cancerous lesions and the histopathology results, if available) after surgical resection or ablation with curative intent.

The study randomised 668 people with a ratio of 1:1 to receive either Tecentriq (1,200 mg every three weeks) plus Avastin (15 mg/kg every three weeks) for a period of 12 months or 17 cycles, or no intervention with active surveillance. The primary endpoint is independent review facility-assessed RFS. Key secondary endpoints include OS, RFS as determined by the investigator and RFS in patients with PD-L1-positive disease.

About hepatocellular carcinoma

Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death and one of the few cancers where mortality is rising.4,5 More than 900,000 people are diagnosed with the disease globally each year, which translates to one person diagnosed every 90 seconds.4 Nine out of ten cases of HCC are caused by chronic liver disease, which includes chronic hepatitis B and C infection, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) and cirrhosis resulting from these conditions.5,6

If diagnosed in the early stage, surgery may be prescribed to remove the primary tumour, however an estimated 70-80% of people with early-stage HCC experience disease recurrence following surgery.2 Early recurrence is associated with poorer prognosis and shorter survival.2,7 Tumour size, number of tumours, and portal vein invasion are associated with an increased risk of recurrence.7

About Tecentriq

Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy approved for some of the most aggressive and difficult-to-treat forms of cancer. Tecentriq was the first cancer immunotherapy approved for the treatment of a certain type of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and HCC. Tecentriq is also approved in countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies, for various forms of metastatic NSCLC, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer, PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma.

Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. In addition to intravenous infusion, the formulation of Tecentriq is also being investigated as a subcutaneous injection to help address the growing burden of cancer treatment for patients and healthcare systems.

https://onepeterfive.com/cardinal-roche-vatican-ii-rupture/,Cardinal Roche on the Vatican II Rupture,"Above: Bishop Athanasius Schneider offers the Holy Mass at St. Peter’s church in Steubenville, Ohio, United States. Photo by Allison Girone.

As I recently wrote on Catholic Answers, the confusion surrounding the meaning of Traditionis custodes, and its flotilla of supplementary documents, is beginning to resemble that around Amoris Laetitia. I was talking specifically about the purpose of the document: what vision of the ecclesial landscape inspires it. Here I want to focus on the equally opaque reasoning behind it.

Last Sunday BBC Radio 4 aired a short report on the Traditional Mass. They talked to the Catholic blogger Maria Jones (do have a look at her channel ‘One of Nine’), a priest who says the TLM, and some Traditional Mass goers they found by chance outside a church. We also heard clips from Austen Ivereigh, papal biographer, and Cardinal Arthur Roche. (Listen here, 5min to 12min.)

On the subject of why TC had been issued, Ivereigh tells us that people who attend the Traditional Mass constitute a sinister ‘movement’ opposed to Vatican II. This claim is presumably inspired by Pope Francis’ 2021 Letter to Bishops. The difficulty with it is that even the most emotional and unsophisticated supporters of the Traditional Mass that the BBC journalists could find lend absolutely no support to this idea. If the ‘movement’ Ivereigh speaks of is only found in some obscure corner of the internet, then it is hard to know why Pope Francis has caused such heartache by restricting the Traditional Mass all over the world.

Cardinal Roche, on the other hand, spoke as follows:

You know the theology of the Church has changed. Whereas before the priest represented, at a distance, all the people. They were channelled, as it were, through this person who alone was celebrating the Mass. It is not only the priest who celebrates the liturgy, but also those who are baptised with him. And that is an enormous statement to make.

This is completely unrelated to the claims made in the Letter to Bishops, and it is hard to think of such a claim being made by a Curial Cardinal before. We have often been told that the idea that ‘the theology of the Church has changed’ is the preserve of extreme progressives and extreme Lefebvrists, and that what the Council actually did was what Pope John XXIII asked it to do (Gaudent Mater Ecclesia):

What … is necessary today is that the whole of Christian doctrine, with no part of it lost, be received in our times by all with a new fervor, in serenity and peace, in that traditional and precise conceptuality and expression which is especially displayed in the acts of the Councils of Trent and Vatican I. … For the deposit of faith, the truths contained in our venerable doctrine, are one thing; the fashion in which they are expressed, but with the same meaning and the same judgement, is another thing.

Is there any basis on the Conciliar texts which supports Cardinal Roche’s ‘new theology’? Well, the Council’s Decree on the Liturgy, Sacrosantum Concilium, tells us (n. 48):

The Church, therefore, earnestly desires that Christ’s faithful, when present at this mystery of faith, should not be there as strangers or silent spectators; on the contrary, through a good understanding of the rites and prayers they should take part in the sacred action conscious of what they are doing, with devotion and full collaboration. They should be instructed by God’s word and be nourished at the table of the Lord’s body; they should give thanks to God; by offering the Immaculate Victim, not only through the hands of the priest, but also with him, they should learn also to offer themselves; through Christ the Mediator, they should be drawn day by day into ever more perfect union with God and with each other, so that finally God may be all in all.

This is indeed the teaching of the Church. But is it new? As has been documented, the document’s footnotes were drastically thinned out at a late stage in its preparation, and this obscures the reality that this paragraph is based on two modern pre-Conciliar magisterial texts.

The first, which coined the unfortunate phrase ‘dumb spectators’ (‘muti spectatores’), is Pope Pius XI’s Apostolic Constitution Divini cultus sanctitatem (1928) n. 9. He was talking about Catholics who weren’t singing the chants in accordance with Pope Pius X’s recommendations in Tra la sollicitudini a quarter of a century earlier.

The other source is Pope Pius XII’s 1947 encyclical Mediator Dei:

By the waters of baptism, as by common right, Christians are made members of the Mystical Body of Christ the Priest, and by the “character” which is imprinted on their souls, they are appointed to give worship to God. Thus they participate, according to their condition, in the priesthood of Christ (88).

Again:

In this most important subject it is necessary, in order to avoid giving rise to a dangerous error, that we define the exact meaning of the word “offer.” The unbloody immolation at the words of consecration, when Christ is made present upon the altar in the state of a victim, is performed by the priest and by him alone, as the representative of Christ and not as the representative of the faithful. But it is because the priest places the divine victim upon the altar that he offers it to God the Father as an oblation for the glory of the Blessed Trinity and for the good of the whole Church. Now the faithful participate in the oblation, understood in this limited sense, after their own fashion and in a twofold manner, namely, because they not only offer the sacrifice by the hands of the priest, but also, to a certain extent, in union with him. It is by reason of this participation that the offering made by the people is also included in liturgical worship (92).

The idea that the people partake, in an important sense, of the offering of the Mass, without confusing the ordained priesthood and the priesthood of all believers, is found throughout the tradition, and is embedded in the texts of the Mass itself. Those who attend the Traditional Mass will be familiar with the word “Oremus”, “Let us pray”—an oft-repeated invitation to join in spirit with the prayer of the priest—and the words of the priest, “Orate fratres ut meum ac vestrum sacrificium acceptabile fiat apud Deum Patrem”: “Pray brethren that my sacrifice and yours be acceptable to God the Father.” The theology of the Traditional Mass, and those who have expounded it over the centuries, is incompatible with the view that the people are passive observers, having no part in the mystery.

The BBC editors linked Cardinal Roche’s comments with the traditional practice of “the priest with his back to the people for most of the Mass.” It is impossible to know if His Eminence made this link himself. But that issue was, notoriously, not debated at the Second Vatican Council. Permission for celebration “facing the people” was slipped out in an Instruction in 1964 (Inter Oecumenini), which in fact only spoke of the construction of new altars. If this heralded a fundamental change—or an ‘enormous statement,’ in Cardinal Roche’s words—that suggests that the soon-to-be abolished Congregation for Rites had more authority than is generally recognised.

I find myself, here, and not for the first time, defending the words of the Second Vatican Council against an interpretation which would impute to them theological novelties incompatible with the perennial teaching of the Church. It’s beyond the scope of this article to do the same thing for everything the Council said, but at least on this important issue, of the manner in which the faithful participate in the Mass, Austen Ivereigh should note that I am not the one criticising Vatican II. It is Cardinal Roche, by implication, who seems to be casting it as introducing an historical rupture into the teaching of the Church.

He can’t, really, have meant this, but I do wonder what he did mean. It is clear that he is casting about for a different kind of rationale for the planned suppression of the Traditional Mass from the one offered by Pope Francis in the Letter to Bishops: one not just based on the empirical claim that its supporters are bad people, which fares so badly when a journalist takes the trouble to ask some worshippers about it. He would like an argument based on the theology of the liturgy, something that would allow him to say that it is objectively bad to allow any celebrations of the Traditional Mass to continue longer than absolutely necessary.

I’d love to hear more about this, because any such argument is going to have this difficulty: that if the Traditional Mass is bad, then the Church’s entire liturgy was bad for fifteen centuries, and most probably the Eastern Rites are bad even today. It would be intriguing indeed to discover that the Dicastery for Divine Worship is saying that celebration ad orientem is theologically problematic, while the Dicastery for the Eastern Churches is at the very same time trying to impose celebration ad orientem on the Syro-Malabars.

If that turns out to be true, we have reached a new phase in the confusion sadly associated with the current papacy.",['Joseph Shaw'],2023-03-24 13:00:29+00:00

https://www.altoonamirror.com/sports/altoona-curve/2023/04/roche-automated-strike-zone-is-coming-to-mlb-parks-soon/,Roche: Automated strike zone is coming to MLB parks soon,"By Walt Frank

wfrank@altoonamirror.com

Technology has changed the way the game of baseball is played and more changes are coming in the future said Marc Roche, Pittsburgh Pirates Technology/Video Coordinator for the minor leagues.

“The automated strike zone is coming to Major League Baseball,” Roche said Thursday while talking to members of the Blair County Chamber of Commerce Breakfast Club at The Casino at Lakemont Park.

“For the most part, umpires do a good job,” Roche said, and he doesn’t believe the new technology will get rid of umpires completely.

But, the automated strike zone was tried in Single A last year and it went well, he said.

“It gave the players a chance to challenge. That is what we will have, a challenge automated strike zone,” he said.

Altoona Curve General Manager Nate Bowen said Roche has helped gather “tons of information” to help the organization.

“In the early days of baseball, we didn’t have much but the ball, bat and glove. Without technology we just played ball the way it had been played,” said Roche, who has been with the Pirates organization since 2018.

The first technology used was the radar gun.

“We became hungrier for more pieces of technology. As the world has grown, there have been new ways to track what we can do on the baseball field,” Roche said.

The TrackMan system is used by all professional leagues in the United States and Japan and by most of the teams in Korea, Taiwan and Latin America. TrackMan provides the largest and most influential digital baseball scouting platform in the world, according to its website.

“TrackMan is like a big radar plate that tracks velocity, horizontal and vertical movement and speed of the ball. How hard you hit the ball and the angle, that can tell us a lot of good and bad about the players. We can measure if a player is getting better than just looking at his batting average, he may be hitting the ball hard but having some bad luck,” Roche said.

Rapsodo camera and radar technology provides accurate, pro-level data.

“It uses very high speed cameras to figure out how the ball is coming out of the pitcher’s hand,” Roche said.

Hawk-Eye Innovations was introduced in 2015 and involves a series of cameras to take video feeds of all of the players.

“A lot of this has happened within the last 10 years, there has also been a lot of technology we have thrown out. We are still learning, there will always be something new to try,” Roche said. “We try to make it simple so players are not overwhelmed; the goal is to help make players better.”

This is the guy who’s been open in Facebook posts about his belief that schools shouldn’t treat children in alignment with their gender identity. In another post attacking Director Thomson, Roche posts a picture of Thomson’s kid daughter.

He’s the chair of the local Republican Party. Apolitical, indeed.

Look: Hypocrisy is the new norm. My point is more the façade of “Ah, shucks, for the kids!” that he so eloquently communicates is one that is echoed by our newest board members — the ones he helped elect — while they methodically dismantle our school district.

We shouldn’t be surprised, then, when Director Morse repeats the transphobic trope at a Greater Albany Public Schools listening session that schools are installing litterboxes for students who identify as cats. Or when Director Wilson can’t define the word equity in an interview.

Or when teachers can’t bargain for a raise — a priority Roche and I apparently share — because the district overspent hiring Director Nyquist’s golfing buddy to be superintendent.

For the kids, indeed.

The new board members are political pawns, voted in for political reasons, to do the political bidding of the political entities they serve. If that’s what you look for in a school board, you’ve likely stopped reading already. For everyone else: Look at the candidates Roche opposes, then vote for them.

https://www.roche.com/stories/science-ophtalmology,Looking beyond the horizon to change the trajectory for vision loss,"With millions of people worldwide living with these retinal conditions, ophthalmology scientists at Roche are determined to change the status quo for better treatment. They are tackling the conditions from multiple angles, with an ultimate goal to hopefully prevent, and even reverse, vision loss. To do this, they must look beyond what we already know.

To have perfect vision, the vessels in our retina need to be healthy. However, the vessels of people living with retinal conditions are unstable, leaky, inflamed and grow abnormally, leading to vision loss or even blindness. The impact on the person and their families is huge. It devastates quality of life, makes them unable to work and experience life in a very different way.

Our pipeline is set up so we can come up with next generation treatments that will hopefully transform patients’ lives.

Pioneering from experience

The discovery of anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) treatment more than 15 years ago, was transformative for the ophthalmology patients. To improve options for patients yet further, Roche has taken an innovative approach applying insights from research in oncology to ophthalmology. A team of scientists is also taking a pioneering approach to focus its efforts on exploring new potential scientific avenues.

Novel targets that enhance efficacy

“We know that improving efficacy is one of the most important elements for improving treatment. Anti-VEGF therapy is efficacious, but we also need to tackle additional factors, such as fibrosis, ischemia and inflammation”, says Sascha.

The challenge for Sascha and his team is how to deliver multiple mechanisms to patient’s eyes to enable this multi-target approach. One of the tools to achieve this are bispecific antibodies, and the seminal invention of CrossMab technology, pioneered by Roche.

This unique technology combines two antigen-recognising elements and therefore enables this dual targeting approach.

The next generation of bispecifics is already in clinical development: DutaFabs, an excellent platform developed by Roche scientists, pave the way for the potential discovery of multiple modes of action (MoAs). This could be game-changing for patients.

Long-acting delivery to reduce the burden for patients

Current treatments that are injected into the vitreous require some patients to attend their doctor once a month for this procedure. This can be difficult for patients, not only in terms of making time and getting to their appointment, but also as the procedure can be quite a daunting one for many. Recognising this, Roche scientists are committed to finding and developing new systems for long-acting delivery that reduce the burden on patients. In this area, substantial progress continues to be made.

Cutting edge technology to pave the way for truly personalised healthcare

A next generation capsid to deliver genes

To date, intravitreal injections have been a mainstay of treatment because of the ability to reach the whole retina. Recently, gene therapy has opened up new potential in ophthalmology with the possibility of bringing genes into the retina to actively enable a change in the course of a disease. “New capsids are needed and through our collaborations and partnerships we are seeking to work together to develop the next generation, with better transduction and, low induction of immune response,” Sascha highlights, noting, “Gene therapy could hopefully provide the ultimate durability for patients, even with complex diseases, to give a treatment option lasting years and moving towards cure.”

Advanced imaging and analysis

Alongside the new potential treatment options, an exploration of technologies that will advance personalised healthcare is central to Roche’s work. The level of detail available through imaging technologies used in ophthalmology clinics is astounding, yet somewhat untapped. Roche scientists are working to harness ways to analyse these advanced images to enable understanding of disease and treatment response. Adding to this, by pioneering the molecular analysis of fluid from the eye, the scientists are seeking to identify patterns in disease for a deeply tailored and timely care that reaches a completely new level.

Taking a stepwise approach to evolution

An openness to finding new ways forward, to partner and collaborate with the best scientific minds is enabling a continuous flow of ideas and new approaches.

Sascha describes Roche’s stepwise approach to science in ophthalmology as, a seemingly small percentage change (in sight) can not only make significant improvements in quality of life, but it can build the momentum for huge leaps forward in reversing damage. Some leaps are already being seen and it is just a matter of time before we see more.","['Sascha Fauser', 'Global Head Of Ophthalmology Roche', 'Pharma Research', 'Early Development', 'Pred']",

LSWA CLASS 4A ALL-STATE BASKETBALL

BY JAKE MARTIN

Written for The LSWA

A three-peat in girls basketball led to Lafayette Christian Academy dominating girls honors, while two boys champions, George Washington Carver and Bossier, claimed top boys honors on the Louisiana Sports Writers Association’s Class 4A all-state teams.

Lafayette Christian’s Jada Richard and Errol Rogers collected girls Outstanding Player and Coach of the Year honors, respectively. Bossier star Tahj Roots earned the earned the Outstanding Player nod and Carver’s Nathaniel Roche notched coach of the year accolades.

Richard, a recent LSU commitment, averaged 28.2 points per game, five assists, four steals and five rebounds as a junior.

After scoring 831 points this season, the 2024 prospect now has 2,021 total points in three years of varsity action.

Rogers has led the Knights to three consecutive state championships across three divisions, including a 28-2 record and a Division II select title in 2022-23.

En route to capturing a nonselect Division II title, Roots averaged 19.7 points per game as a sharpshooter for the Bearkats. He helped power Bossier to victories over No. 1 Wossman and No. 3 Carroll at the LHSAA tournament.

On the select side, Roche led his No. 6 seed Rams to a Division II select title with wins against the No. 1 seed Madison Prep, No. 2 seed Peabody and No. 3 seed Archbishop Hannan. This came after graduating multiple players for his team that won a Class 4A title in 2022 as the No. 1 seed.

Like LCA’s Richard, for the second year in a row Vandebilt Catholic’s Makayla Charles, Ellender’s Jamia Singleton, St. Thomas More’s AC Froehlich and Brusly’s Tia Anderson netted LSWA girls honors.

Lafayette Christian’s Kameron Williams and Hannan’s Drew Timmons garnered LSWA boys recognition for the second straight year.

Real-world studies of Vabysmo demonstrate ability to extend treatment intervals in the first four months while maintaining visual acuity

Clinical data on an investigational anti-interleukin-6 treatment in uveitic macular edema will be presented for the first time





Basel, 13 April 2023 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that new data for its approved and investigational medicines will be highlighted in 30 abstracts at the 2023 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Annual Meeting, which will be held from 23-27 April 2023 in New Orleans, United States. The abstracts showcase the strength and breadth of Roche’s Ophthalmology portfolio, including post-hoc data from phase III Vabysmo® (faricimab) studies that support its benefit in drying retinal fluid in neovascular or ‘wet’ age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME).1-3 Real-world data on Vabysmo treatment patterns and outcomes will be presented, as well as approaches to personalised healthcare that include the use of artificial intelligence (AI) modelling to predict retinal disease progression.4-7 Additionally, phase I data for an investigational anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) treatment in uveitic macular edema (UME), to be presented for the first time, suggest the monoclonal antibody may improve visual acuity in patients with UME.8

“The breadth of data we are presenting at ARVO demonstrates our sustained commitment to preserving vision for people with potentially blinding retinal conditions,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are particularly encouraged by data indicating that Vabysmo may stabilise blood vessels and reduce fluid in the retina. Fluid control is essential for optimal central vision used for everyday activities such as reading and driving.”

The following data will be presented at ARVO 2023:

Vabysmo improves drying for people with nAMD and DME1-3

A post-hoc analysis from the head-to-head dosing period of the phase III TENAYA and LUCERNE studies suggests Vabysmo results in greater drying of retinal fluid compared to aflibercept in people with nAMD. The data include change in central subfield thickness (CST), absence of subretinal and intraretinal fluid (SRF and IRF) and time to absence of SRF and IRF.

A post-hoc analysis from the head-to-head dosing period of the phase III YOSEMITE and RHINE studies also supports the positive impact of Vabysmo on macular blood vessel leakage compared to aflibercept in people with DME. Outcomes include macular leakage area and the proportion of patients with minimal to no macular leakage - two important markers of vascular stability. Another analysis from YOSEMITE and RHINE suggests Vabysmo reduces retinal fluid when compared to aflibercept in people with DME. The data include time to absence of DME (CST <325 µm) and time to absence of IRF.

Vabysmo extends dosing intervals early in the real world4,5

Two Vabysmo real-world studies in nAMD and DME show patients extended their dosing intervals early in their treatment while maintaining or improving their vision. The majority of patients were able to extend their treatment intervals during the four initial doses. Treatment intervals were categorised as ‘extended’ if any interval was more than six weeks apart.

Investigational IL-6 monoclonal antibody may benefit people with UME8

Phase I data on an IL-6 inhibitor that is in development for UME and other retinal conditions suggest that this investigational monoclonal antibody improves visual acuity and CST in patients with UME.

The IL-6 pathway plays an important role in the development and progression of UME by promoting blood vessel leakage and inflammation.9 UME is a complication of uveitis, a form of eye inflammation.10 This results in accumulation of fluid in the macula and can lead to significant visual impairment and vision loss.10 The estimated prevalence of uveitis is between 6 to 12 people per 10,000 globally, and approximately one-third of these people are impacted by UME.11

Roche recently launched two phase III trials in UME based on encouraging phase I safety and efficacy data. The first patients have been treated in the Meerkat ( NCT05642312 ) and Sandcat ( NCT05642325 ) studies, which are evaluating the safety and efficacy of the monoclonal antibody in people with UME.12,13 Roche is also studying the IL-6 inhibitor in DME.14

AI and machine learning6,7,15-17

Roche will also present research related to the diagnosis and treatment of retinal conditions. These presentations include new research on the use of AI and machine learning to predict disease progression in geographic atrophy, a progressive and irreversible form of AMD; enable timely and accurate assessment of disease activity in nAMD or DME; predict treatment response in DME; and investigate new imaging biomarkers in diabetic retinopathy.

About neovascular age-related macular degeneration

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that affects the part of the eye that provides sharp, central vision needed for activities like reading.18 Neovascular or ‘wet’ AMD (nAMD) is an advanced form of the disease that can cause rapid and severe vision loss if left untreated.19,20 It develops when new and abnormal blood vessels grow uncontrolled under the macula, causing swelling, bleeding and/or fibrosis.19 Worldwide, around 20 million people are living with nAMD – the leading cause of vision loss in people over the age of 60 – and the condition will affect even more people around the world as the global population ages.18,21,22

About diabetic macular edema

Affecting around 21 million people globally, diabetic macular edema (DME) is a vision-threatening retinal condition associated with blindness and decreased quality of life when left untreated.23 DME occurs when damaged blood vessels leak into and cause swelling in the macula – the central area of the retina responsible for the sharp vision needed for reading and driving.24,25 The number of people with DME is expected to grow as the prevalence of diabetes increases.26

About the Vabysmo® (faricimab) clinical development programme

Roche has a robust phase III clinical development programme for Vabysmo. The programme includes AVONELLE-X, an extension study of TENAYA and LUCERNE evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of Vabysmo in neovascular or ‘wet’ age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), and Rhone-X, an extension study of YOSEMITE and RHINE evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of Vabysmo in diabetic macular edema (DME).27,28 In addition, Roche is investigating the efficacy and safety of Vabysmo in people with macular edema following retinal vein occlusion in two phase III studies, BALATON and COMINO.29,30 Roche has also initiated several phase IV studies, including the Elevatum study of Vabysmo in underrepresented patient populations with DME, the SALWEEN study of Vabysmo in a subpopulation of nAMD highly prevalent in Asia, as well as the VOYAGER study, a global real-world data collection platform.31-33 Roche also supports several other independent studies to further understand retinal conditions with a high unmet need.14

About Vabysmo® (faricimab)

Vabysmo is the first bispecific antibody approved for the eye.34,35 It targets and inhibits two signalling pathways linked to a number of vision-threatening retinal conditions by neutralising angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A).36,37 Ang-2 and VEGF-A contribute to vision loss by destabilising blood vessels, causing new leaky blood vessels to form and increasing inflammation.36,37 By blocking pathways involving Ang-2 and VEGF-A, Vabysmo is designed to stabilise blood vessels. Vabysmo is approved in 60 countries around the world, including the United States (U.S.), Japan, the United Kingdom and in the European Union for people living with neovascular or ‘wet’ age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema.14,34,35,38,39 Review by other regulatory authorities is ongoing.

navify Algorithm Suite is a secure digital ecosystem that links physicians easily to a range of medical algorithms from Roche and its innovation partners without the hurdle of integrating multiple algorithm providers.

First available medical algorithms focus on identifying patients at risk for some liver and colon cancers. Medical algorithms for cardiac, lung and other disease states are in the pipeline.

ROTKREUZ, Switzerland, April 11, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) introduces its navify® Algorithm Suite, a single platform hosting a library of digital medical algorithms that generate patient-centric insights and can aid earlier diagnosis of cancer and other conditions per intended use, at the HIMSS Global Conference in Chicago, USA, from April 17- 21, 2023.

Roche

Physicians use medical algorithms, evidence-based decision-making tools, in the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients to optimise care, increase early diagnosis and adhere to guidelines. Use of real-time clinical decision support is associated with adherence to evidence-based guidelines and as an aid in screening of colorectal cancer.2,3

""As healthcare data is set to grow,4 digital medical algorithms can generate actionable insights which physicians can use to start delivering on the promise of personalised healthcare,"" said Moritz Hartmann, Global Head of Roche Information Solutions at Roche Diagnostics. ""With navify Algorithm Suite, clinicians can easily order the medical algorithms they need from Roche and other providers to get enhanced insights that improve patient care.""

navify Algorithm Suite offers labs and hospitals one platform to connect easily to digital medical algorithms from a diverse range of innovators. This makes it easier for physicians to use and adopt the medical algorithms they need. Simultaneously, navify Algorithm Suite also offers universities and other providers of digital algorithms a direct channel to distribute their proven innovations to practising physicians in markets worldwide.

The platform is designed to be embedded in existing healthcare workflows and the lab or hospital information system (LIS/HIS) and/or the EHR/EMR (electronic health/medical record). Designed for optimal information security management, navify Algorithm Suite complies with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) regulations in Europe as well as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability) in the USA.

The first algorithms in the navify Algorithm Suite focus on oncology:

GAAD 5 is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of early stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic liver disease. GAAD (an in-vitro diagnostic multivariate index assay) analyses gender, age in combination with results of two Roche assays Elecsys AFP and Elecsys PIVKA. This CE-marked algorithm 6 may help physicians diagnose early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide 7 and HCC is the most common form of liver cancer accounting for ~90% of cases. 8 It is not available in the US.

https://www.gallup.com/workplace/472763/roche-health-innovations-patient-safety.aspx,Roche: Health Innovations With Patient Safety,"Story Highlights By 2030, Roche committed to doubling healthcare advancements at half the cost

Roche’s Patient Safety is leading industry innovation to advance healthcare

A strengths-based approach to patient safety gets measurable returns

Culture is the key to unlocking an organization’s greatest potential. For Gallup’s clients, culture has been worth as much as an 85% net profit increase over five years, among other key outcomes. A strong company culture is strengths-based, recognizing the value of each employee’s contribution, empowering people to increase their influence and impact, and giving each individual what they need to do their best at work every day.

A strengths-based culture creates an unbeatable competitive advantage and supports greater collaboration, innovation and performance. Leaders must consistently reinforce, measure and monitor their culture and its relationship to the organization’s key performance metrics. In this article, Gallup spotlights Roche’s ambitious culture transformation to drive industry-leading healthcare innovations in patient safety.

Introduction: Powerful Ambitions

By 2030, Roche has committed to double the number of medical advancements and reduce the cost of healthcare to society by 50%. As one of the world’s largest and long-standing diagnostics and biopharma companies, Roche’s ambition is to lead the industry through innovations that improve patient health and help people live longer, better lives.

While medical advancements and healthcare costs come from myriad sources, Roche identified a uniquely untapped innovation opportunity to deliver significant benefits: patient safety.

Biopharma companies can invest millions of dollars and hours of their employees’ working lives in medicines that can end up being discontinued because of adverse effects on patient safety. The medicine’s health risks and side effects can compromise patient safety so much that they outweigh its benefit. Not only is the financial price of failed medicine burdensome to the healthcare system, but this cost also includes the thousands, if not millions, of people who continue to suffer from an ailment without an effective medicine or therapy to treat it.

###Embeddable###

Optimizing the patient’s health and safety throughout a medicine’s entire life cycle -- from early-stage development through post-marketing until the end of its availability on the market -- is a unique and timely opportunity to achieving Roche’s 2030 commitment to healthcare worldwide.

Roche has consistently implemented a systematic process to ensure that the benefits of its medicines to patients outweigh the risk of unwanted side effects and that the company identifies, mitigates, and communicates these risks immediately. Yet achieving these ambitious and innovative healthcare goals requires a new way of thinking, working and collaborating, requiring the very best of patient safety professionals’ strengths.

Current Situation: A Focus on Patient Safety

When Felix Arellano, Roche’s SVP and Global Head of Product Development Safety Risk Management, and Christina Bisschops-Kaltenbach, Roche’s VP and Global Head of International Pharmacovigilance Safety Risk Management, considered their ambition to double healthcare advancement at half the cost, they determined that at its foundation, it would require a new level of collaboration requiring the very best of their people every day. Considering this demand, Roche Safety leadership asked two key questions:

How do we leverage the strengths of our professionals to build the capability required to create a patient-centric safety organization able to collect and interpret patient data closer to the point of care and perform effective decision-making about care and patient safety? How do we move beyond the culture of safety as a compliance-driven function to one that delivers significant value to patients and society through a more holistic approach to patient safety risk management?

The challenge is twofold: First, recent medical advances have come from more complex treatment modalities that introduce new safety risks, and regulatory bodies are only beginning to understand how to monitor and create accountability for managing them. With this complexity comes “big data” -- large datasets that present both a new challenge and an opportunity for insights to improve patient safety at a lower cost.

“Big data will continue to become a significant driver of analytics and insights, especially as we move towards integrated healthcare solutions,” says Bisschops-Kaltenbach.

“This is now a global world where data doesn’t sleep, and patients can access global information,” Arellano reiterates. “This requires a different set of capabilities to be able to inform patients and prescribers about the safety profile of drugs.”

Second, sparked by the urgency and uncertainty of the health risks of COVID-19 and its vaccinations in recent years, another fundamental change in today’s healthcare environment is the degree to which patients actively participate in medical treatment decisions. Of course, not all the widely accessible information patients consume is trustworthy. Patients and their families frequently make their own judgments about its reliability without the benefit of the medical knowledge to do so.

“Safety is foundational for our industry,” comments Bisschops-Kaltenbach. “We’ve moved beyond safety as a compliance-driven function to one that can deliver value to society through patient-centric risk management.” This entails going beyond meeting regulatory requirements and involvement at the point of care to helping patients manage their health.

Opportunity: Use Strengths

For Arellano and Bisschops-Kaltenbach, the healthcare industry has a unique and timely opportunity to reimagine patient safety.

Both further observe that this situation requires using their people’s collective strengths to engage in “systems thinking,” which considers not only the impact on individual patients but also on society at large. It also requires deriving intelligence from various data sources and communicating insights and advice concisely and meaningfully to new and varied stakeholders, including healthcare providers, commercial partners and, of course, patients and their families.

High-performing companies have cultures where leaders, managers and employees are encouraged and provided support to develop everyone’s unique potential. Gallup’s workplace research shows that employees who focus on developing their individual talents perform better than those who don’t: Team employee engagement scores increase by up to 23%, and performance improves by up to 18%.

Arellano and Bisschops-Kaltenbach recognize that these new job demands will require people to know how to use their strengths. According to Gallup, when organizations take a strengths-based approach to create high-performing cultures like Roche’s patient Safety organization, the returns delivered are 10% greater customer engagement, 18% higher sales performance, and 23% increased profitability.

Solution: An Integrated Network Getting the Best of All

In January 2021, led by Arellano and Bisschops-Kaltenbach, Roche’s Product Development Safety Risk Management group launched Imagine Safety, an integrated network of expertise widely accessible to patients and other key stakeholders.

Bisschops-Kaltenbach’s International Pharmacovigilance Group defined four key Imagine Safety objectives that would reposition patient safety as a key to doubling medical advancements at half the cost:

Build scalability to support Roche’s growing portfolio and enable the organization to evolve quickly to do things differently. Avoid missed opportunities to proactively address customers’ unmet safety needs at scale. Address the lack of consistency in affiliate safety operating models to reduce risk and exposure and ensure compliance with local regulatory authorities. Deliver on an evolving and highly complex portfolio.

This integrated network required a transition toward a radically different global operating model to achieve these goals -- a profound shift from a country-focused affiliate structure. To meet the big data and patient empowerment opportunities, Roche would require regional clusters to function as a collective, centrally sourcing data, insights and patient value.

Bisschops-Kaltenbach discusses the importance of collaboration: “If you want to go fast, go alone. But if you want to go far, then go together.” Fostering robust cross-country affiliate leadership collaboration requires a level of fluency in each employee’s strengths to build relationships, influence, critically think and implement innovations.

To ensure the success and sustainability of Roche’s collaborative and locally empowered operating structure, Imagine Safety made structural changes and invested in its people’s strengths and leadership development.

Arellano and Bisschops-Kaltenbach knew the importance of shifting their focus away from transactional activities to working with their ecosystem partners to empower patients at the point of care to ensure that patients receive optimal value. To facilitate this, Roche Patient Safety further consolidated transactional activities in the company’s global centers of excellence (Pharmacovigilance Hubs), which support every one of Roche’s affiliates today.

In addition, Roche Patient Safety introduced the SafetyNet. This formalized network bridges Safety in the Affiliates with Global functions, intending to understand and anticipate affiliate patient safety needs, use expertise across the organization and address these needs consistently at scale.

Fostering robust cross-country affiliate leadership collaboration requires a level of fluency in each employee’s strengths to build relationships, influence, critically think and implement innovations.

Patient Safety leaders now needed to be willing and able to promote new ways of collaborating within their teams and across the global organization.

Arellano and Bisschops-Kaltenbach also redoubled Roche’s efforts to invest in associates’ strengths to develop diverse, agile teams and help associates succeed. The company sought to cultivate its talent by redeploying individuals to different functions and creating new opportunities for growth, with the aim of building a patient-safety ecosystem in which talented individuals can apply their unique strengths to do what they do best every day and develop for future career growth.

In alignment with strengths science, Roche made a strategic decision to recognize that each person in Imagine Safety had unique value to offer and retain and invest in developing all existing talent. This retention strategy further avoided the direct and indirect costs of and impact on turnover, engagement and trust. Instead, Roche’s Safety leadership sourced research-based and proven methods to accelerate the strengths and abilities of its existing talent.

A foundational component of Roche’s investment in talent is the Competency Accelerator Experience (CAE) development program, which aims to identify talent in the organization and help associates to develop and productively apply their individual strengths. The CAE is called an “accelerator” program because it aims to upskill existing leaders with the belief that they have the innate strengths to perform. It was simply a matter of accelerating the development of these strengths to deliver the competencies they needed in their new role.

The CAE is called an “accelerator” program because it aims to upskill existing leaders with the belief that they have the innate strengths to perform.

Darren Stewart, Faculty Lead for the CAE, says, “the objective of the CAE is to enable breakthroughs in personal and professional effectiveness and further everyone’s impact and value add.” Like modern executive education programs, this experience is demanding by design. Led by internal and external faculty members, participants apply a principle-centered approach to mindset enablement for individual, team, managerial and leadership levels of effectiveness.

The CAE was designed to help participants effectively use their strengths to navigate and operate in a global environment across different ecosystems and be an influencer in Roche Safety and beyond, enabling participants to expand personal, contribution and influence. During in-person weeks, cohort participants receive individual leadership and effectiveness coaching, including CliftonStrengths leadership insights from Gallup. They also work on current and prominent patient safety business challenges and apply the CAE principles to develop innovative and measurably profitable solutions.

The CAE’s application-based total immersion experience takes place over five months, and in the first 18 months of the program, Roche will see approximately 125 individuals complete the experience. Participants repeatedly and consistently reflect, “This program has changed my life.”

Outcomes and Looking Forward

Imagine Safety has already changed Roche’s approach to patient safety and resulted in positive business outcomes. It has established strengths-based collaboration and co-creation between country-level affiliates, allowing affiliate leaders to discuss and resolve questions, anticipate opportunities, and share and scale best practices.

The initial feedback on the CAE has been overwhelmingly positive and is now being delivered across Roche’s global and affiliate or country-level organizations. The strategic decision to retain and invest in the company’s existing talent has already been validated. One participant remarked that the program offers “the perfect opportunity for the caterpillar to become a butterfly in terms of identity, personal and professional growth, and mindset.”

The CAE creates a cultural marker for Safety leaders and associates to know what Imagine Safety’s values are, what it stands for and what its priorities are in using the strengths of its people to deliver unmet patient needs. It is one vital component of Imagine Safety’s initiative to enable Roche to build a patient-centric patient safety organization with a culture of continuous learning.

What’s coming next? As Roche continues to deploy the CAE globally, the company is eager to measure the business outcomes to verify its strengths-based approach to culture transformation’s impact on employee engagement, customer engagement, sales, profit and society. The company also aims to assess the changes resulting from lessons learned and will focus on sustaining and accelerating the growth in value delivered by Safety to Roche, the industry and, of course, to patients.

Assessing progress on the journey so far, Bisschops-Kaltenbach is realistic and ambitious: “We operate in a very complex environment, and we don’t have all the answers. But together, we can find the answers through co-creation. We need to strengthen our ‘muscle’ of feeling comfortable with change and uncertainty.”

Despite or because of the challenges ahead, for Roche, the opportunity to innovate through strengths and reimagine and transform patient safety is now.

Mary was the eldest of three children born to Maurice Roche, the 4th Baron Fermoy, and his wife Ruth, who both had close ties to the Royal Family. Ruth, the founder of the King’s Lynn Music Festival, was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, while Lord Fermoy was part of King George VI’s shooting party on the day before the king’s death, according to The Times. The couple rented a property on the Sandringham estate, in Norfolk.

Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer shared three photographs taken throughout Mary’s life on his Instagram account, where he regularly shares fascinating finds from his family archive. He wrote: ‘It was my Aunt Mary’s funeral yesterday.

God, grant me the serenity

to accept the people I cannot change,

which is pretty much everyone,

since I’m clearly not you, God.

At least not the last time I checked.

And while you’re at it, God,

please give me the courage

to change what I need to change about myself,

which is frankly a lot, since, once again,

I’m not you, which means I’m not perfect.

It’s better for me to focus on changing myself

than to worry about changing other people,

who, as you’ll no doubt remember me saying,

I can’t change anyway.

Finally, give me the wisdom to just shut up

whenever I think that I’m clearly smarter

than everyone else in the room,

that no one knows what they’re talking about except me,

or that I alone have all the answers.

Basically, God,

grant me the wisdom

to remember that I’m

not you.

Amen.

Summary Companies 2023 outlook weaker than expected - analysts

Shares down 1.4% in early trading

Co says falling demand for COVID treatments, testing will hit sales

New CEO under pressure to replenish new drug pipeline















BASEL, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Roche (ROG.S) warned on Thursday profits will decline in 2023 as falling demand for its COVID-19 therapy and diagnostics kits will knock sales by over $5 billion, the latest sign that the pharmaceutical industry's years-long pandemic boost is ebbing.

Sales and core earnings per share were expected to decrease at a ""low single-digit"" percentage this year, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and diagnostics company said in a statement.

COVID-related sales, mainly from lab testing and antibody treatment Ronapreve, are seen falling by 5 billion Swiss francs ($5.5 billion) for the full year, it said.

Revenue growth from new drugs, including its haemophilia treatment and multiple sclerosis drug, would not make up for the steep COVID drop.

But ""the underlying business is growing very strongly in the high single digits,"" said Chief Executive Severin Schwan.

The pivot away from the coronavirus pandemic, which has boosted profits of many healthcare companies over the past three years, also weighed on rival diagnostics group Siemens Healthineers (SHLG.DE), which reported a 28% drop in quarterly operating profit.

Roche's shares fell as much as 1.4% to their lowest since March 2020 as investors worried about the weaker-than-expected outlook. They were down 0.9% at .

Barclays analsyts said 2023 guidance was slightly below their forecasts, but they were encouraged by the performance of its key pharma business, including newly-launched Vabysmo, which treats a common cause of blindness in the elderly.

Last year, Roche group revenue edged 1% higher to 63.3 billion Swiss francs, the company reported, slightly beating market expectations of 63.2 billion francs, while core operating profit gained 1% to 22.2 billion Swiss francs, just shy of the average analyst estimate of 22.4 billion francs.

Analysts have said that market confidence in Roche's drug development abilities, previously among the highest in the industry, has taken a blow from trial setbacks last year in Alzheimer's disease and a cancer immunotherapy hopeful.

The stock has fallen about 11% over the past three years, lagging its main global rivals like Pfizer (PFE.N) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L).

Roche has lagged rivals

REINVIGORATE PIPELINE

The onus to reinvigorate the pipeline will be on chief executive officer-designate Thomas Schinecker, who was previously Roche's head of diagnostics and due to be promoted to group CEO in March. Schwan will become chairman.

In the wake of Schinecker's appointment, the head of Roche's pharmaceuticals division, Bill Anderson, decided in December to leave after 16 years with the Swiss drugmaker.

Family-controlled Roche said on Thursday that Teresa Graham, currently Head of Global Product Strategy for Roche Pharmaceuticals, would succeed Anderson.

In a media call, Schwan said the company was analysing the failed trials thoroughly, but structural changes in research and development (R&D) were not called for, despite the planned changeover in management.

Roche is not alone. Analysts were disappointed on Wednesday that GSK (GSK.L) did not give more details on how one of the world's top drugmakers plans to find its next set of blockbuster drugs.

Roche's bestseller multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus gained a currency-adjusted 17% in sales to just over 6 billion francs during the year, while its haemophilia treatment Hemlibra jumped 27% to 3.8 billion francs, both slightly above market expectations.

Its near-term commercial performance will depend on newly launched drugs such as Evrysdi, an oral drug against muscle-wasting disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and Vabysmo.

Schwan pointed in particular to Vabysmo, with 591 million francs in its market debut year, one of Roche's best.

What Happened: SAB-176 is produced using SAB's proprietary DiversitAb platform, which enables rapid, scalable production of highly potent, fully-human polyclonal IgG antibodies without human donors.

Data from previously completed trials indicate that SAB-176 offers broad antibody protection against multiple strains of this rapidly mutating virus.

Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: SAB Biotherapeutics Says Influenza, COVID-19 Candidates Showing Broad Efficacy Against Variants.

In the Phase 2a study, SAB-176 showed broad cross-protection that included strains that were not specifically targeted in manufacturing the therapeutic.

SAB also received FDA guidance and regulatory alignment on advancing SAB-176 into the next development phase by initiating a Phase 2b dose-range finding efficacy and safety trial in high-risk patients for developing severe disease.

Why It Matters: The CDC estimates an average of 9 to 41 million cases of influenza each year in the U.S., with 140,000-710,000 hospitalizations and 12,000-52,000 deaths per year.

While Roche Holdings AG's RHHBY Tamiflu (oseltamivir) is an effective therapy for treating influenza if used within two days of symptom onset, some patients still develop severe disease and resistant strains of influenza to anti-viral drugs has increased in recent years.

SAB Biotherapeutics says that SAB-176 offers the potential for additional treatment for influenza, particularly in higher-risk patients.

In January, SAB Biotherapeutics received an additional $8.2 million from the U.S. Department of Defense related to the closeout of the discontinued COVID-19 prototype R&D contract.

The ovarian cancer drugs market consists of sales of Paclitaxel, Cisplatin, Adriamycin PFS (Doxorubicin Hydrochloride), Carboplatin, Cyclophosphamide, and Platinol (Cisplatin). Values in this market are 'factory gate' values, that is the value of goods sold by the manufacturers or creators of the goods, whether to other entities (including downstream manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers) or directly to end customers. The value of goods in this market includes related services sold by the creators of the goods.



The ovarian cancer drugs refer to cancer drugs to treat ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is caused due to abnormal growth of cells in the ovary. This industry includes establishments that produce drugs used in chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery for treating ovarian cancer. The ovarian cancer drugs include Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome, Evacet (Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome), Cytoxan (Cyclophosphamide), Paraplat (Carboplatin), Taxol (Paclitaxel), Neosar (Cyclophosphamide) and others.



North America is the largest region in the ovarian cancer drugs market in 2022. Middle East is expected to be the fastest growing region in the forecast period. The regions covered in the ovarian cancer drugs market report are Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, Middle East and Africa.



The main types of tumors in ovarian cancer drugs are epithelial ovarian cancer, ovarian low malignant potential tumor, germ cell tumor, and sex cord-stromal tumor. The most frequent kind of ovarian cancer is epithelial ovarian cancer. The majority of ovarian tumors (90 percent) are epithelial.

Story continues

Ovarian cancer that began in the epithelial layer protecting the ovary is known as epithelial ovarian cancer. The different types of drugs include alkylating agents, mitotic inhibitors, antirheumatics, antipsoriatics, VEGF/VEGF inhibitors, parp inhibitors, antineoplastics, others, and distribution channels such as hospital pharmacies, drug stores, others.



The rising incidence of ovarian cancer is driving the ovarian cancer drugs market. Furthermore, ovarian cancer is recorded to be the eighth most commonly occurring cancer in women and the 18th most commonly occurring cancer across the globe. According to a study by The World Ovarian Cancer Coalition an estimated 55% rise is expected in the number of patients suffering from ovarian cancer by 2035.

According to the Cancer Statistics in 2020, published by the American Cancer Society, about 1,806,590 new cancer cases and 606,520 deaths were expected in the USA. Thus, the increasing incidence of ovarian cancer cases across the globe drives the ovarian cancer drugs market growth.



The increasing use of biologics and targeted therapies is restraining the Ovarian Cancer drug market growth. Targeted therapies act as substitutes for drugs as they identify and attack cancer cells rather than destroying normal cells. For example, Bevacizumab is a targeted therapy biologics drug used to treat Ovarian Cancer.

A targeted therapy drug, Zejula was approved by FDA for ovarian cancer, and many targeted therapy drugs such as PARP inhibitors (targeted therapy drug) are undergoing clinical trials and are in the drug pipeline. FDA has also approved Genentech's biologics license for ovarian cancer drugs highlighting the fact many new companies are entering the biologics ovarian drug cancer market. Hence, the growing popularity of alternatives such as biologics and targeted therapies may hinder the growth of the ovarian cancer drugs market.



Drug manufacturing companies in the industry are increasingly innovating and developing combination drugs to treat ovarian cancer drugs. Combination drugs consist of two or more active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) that are combined into a single dosage form to treat complex medical conditions.

The pharmaceutical companies in the ovarian cancer drugs market are investing in the research and development of innovative products such as combination drugs to reduce manufacturing costs, increase compliance and efficiency, improve medication concordance, increase profitability and reduce side effects. For instance, Roche's blockbuster tranquilize Avastin (bevacizumab), is a combination drug approved by FDA, with ingredients such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, which is utilized to treat advanced stage (III or IV) ovarian cancer.



The Ovarian cancer drugs market is governed by the regulatory framework of agencies such as the Food and Administration Agency (FDA) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).

EAPP is Roche’s proprietary innovative blood test that seeks to facilitate the earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).

In the past year, the shares of Roche have dropped 29.6% against the industry’s 1% increase.

AD is a highly concerning neurodegenerative disease with a limited scope of early and accurate diagnosis. Globally, about 75% of people living with AD symptoms are without a conclusive diagnosis. Moreover, people who have received a diagnosis, have had to wait 2.8 years on average after the onset of symptoms. Under such circumstances, Roche and Lilly believe that the strain put on healthcare systems by AD can be partially relieved by making a patient’s journey to a diagnosis faster and more accessible, which will therefore enable early access to potential future therapies.

Roche’s EAPP measures phosphorylated Tau (pTau) 181 protein assay and apolipoprotein (APOE) E4 assay in human blood plasma.Elevations in pTau181 occur in the early stages of Alzheimer’s, while the presence of APOE4 constitutes the most common genetic risk factor for AD. A negative reading following the test with the EAPP signifies that the patient is unlikely to be amyloid-positive and should be investigated for other causes of cognitive decline.

We would like to remind the investors that in July 2022, the FDA granted the breakthrough device designation to Roche’s EAPP. Last December, Roche also received FDA 510(k) clearance for its Elecsys beta-Amyloid (1-42) CSF II (Abeta42) and Elecsys Phospho-Tau (181P) CSF (pTau181) assays, which identify Alzheimer's pathology in its early symptomatic stage.

Basel, 22 March, 2023 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that it has entered into a collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company to support the development of Roche’s Elecsys® Amyloid Plasma Panel (EAPP). The EAPP is an innovative blood test that aims to facilitate the earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.

Today, barriers to early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer’s exist across the globe with up to 75% of people living with the symptoms of Alzheimer’s, but without a diagnosis. Those who have received a diagnosis waited, on average, 2.8 years after symptom onset1. To address the growing strain that Alzheimer’s is putting on healthcare systems, it will be essential to make a person's journey to diagnosis faster and more accessible. This will ultimately enable access to appropriate new therapies as they become available.

This collaboration is aligned to both Roche and Lilly’s shared objective to support patients by improving the journey to a timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment. If approved, the EAPP test would be an additional tool to identify low likelihood of amyloid pathology in symptomatic patients and determine whether they should proceed to further evaluation and testing that may confirm a diagnosis.

“We are excited to be collaborating with Lilly on such an important area of unmet medical need,” said Matt Sause, CEO of Roche Diagnostics. “Today, over 55 million people are living with dementia and this is projected to increase to nearly 140 million by 20502. Collaboration is essential to ensure these people receive a timely and accurate diagnosis. The Elecsys® Amyloid Plasma Panel has the potential to streamline a person's journey to diagnosis and, therefore, access to future treatment options.”

""We are pleased to be joining Roche to support the development of yet another potential diagnostic tool,” said Mark Mintun, Lilly group vice president – Neuroscience R&D and president, Avid Radiopharmaceuticals. ""We look forward to the robust data and continued collaboration across the field that will be critical to accelerate the ecosystem to aid in a timely and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer’s.""

In July, Roche announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted the EAPP Breakthrough Device Designation.

In December 2022, Roche also received FDA 510(k) clearance for its Elecsys® beta-Amyloid (1-42) CSF II (Abeta42) and Elecsys® Phospho-Tau (181P) CSF (pTau181) assays, which identify Alzheimer's pathology in its early symptomatic stage.

About the Elecsys® Amyloid Plasma Panel

The Elecsys Amyloid Plasma Panel measures phosphorylated Tau (pTau) 181 protein assay and apolipoprotein (APOE) E4 assay in human blood plasma. Elevations in pTau181 occur in early stages of Alzheimer’s, while the presence of APOE4 constitutes the most common genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. The result is intended for consideration in conjunction with other clinical information to advise for further confirmatory testing with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. Patients testing negative with the Elecsys Amyloid Plasma Panel are unlikely to be amyloid positive and should be investigated for other causes of cognitive decline.

About Roche in Alzheimer’s disease

With more than two decades of scientific research in Alzheimer’s, Roche is working towards a day when we can detect the disease early and stop its progression to preserve what makes people who they are. Today, the company’s Alzheimer’s portfolio spans investigational medicines for different targets, types and stages of the disease. It also includes approved and investigational tools, including digital and blood-based tests and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays, aiming to more effectively detect, diagnose, and monitor the disease. Yet the global challenges of Alzheimer’s go well beyond the capabilities of science, and making a meaningful impact requires collaboration both within the Alzheimer’s community and outside of healthcare. We will continue to work together with numerous partners with the hope we can transform millions of lives.

Eligible patients will have received two or more lines of systemic therapy, and are either unable to receive CAR-T cell therapy or have previously received CAR-T cell therapy.

CAR-T therapies have changed the landscape of treating rare forms of blood cancer such as DLBCL. They involve extracting a cancer patient’s T cells, genetically engineering them to hunt down cancer cells, and then reinfusing them. However, many patients don’t respond to these cell therapies. Additionally, the painstaking manufacturing process can take weeks to complete, which can be too long for patients with aggressive cancer. Therefore, more off-the-shelf options are desperately needed in late-stage DLBCL.

""DLBCL is an aggressive lymphoma that is the most commonly diagnosed subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma,"" stated Antonella Rizza, CEO, Lymphoma Canada in Roche’s public release​. She added that the approval of the off-the-shelf treatment Columvi provides ""an important new treatment option for relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients after multiple lines of therapy and ineligible for or having previously received CAR-T therapy.""

How Columvi works

Columvi binds to cancerous immune B cells via the surface protein CD20. To tackle the cancer, the bispecific antibody also simultaneously binds to nearby immune T cells via the surface protein CD3. The T cells are then triggered to destroy the diseased B cells. Unlike other CD20-CD3 bispecific antibodies such as Roche’s mosunetuzumab (Lunsumio), Columvi is designed to work even when the patient has already been treated with competing anti-CD20 cancer treatments such as rituximab and obinutuzumab, making it easier to combine the therapies.

Additionally, Columvi is also the first of its kind to be dosed for a fixed duration in DLBCL. Many other cancer therapies are provided over a long time, which can be expensive and burdensome for patients.

The approval by Health Canada was based on results from a single-arm phase 1/2 study called NP30179, where 35.2% of DLBCL patients receiving Columvi had all signs of cancer disappear. Meanwhile, half of the treated patients saw their cancer decrease. The approval is also conditional upon further clinical trials that confirm the benefits of Columvi.

Chasing FDA approval

Roche now plans to obtain approval of Columvi from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with a decision expected by July 2023.

T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies have been around for around a decade. One of the pioneers was Amgen’s blinatumomab (Blincyto), which got U.S. FDA market approval in 2014 for the treatment of forms of B cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. More recent approvals include Janssen’s teclistamab-cqyv for the treatment of multiple myeloma in 2022.

In late 2022, Lunsumio became the first approved CD20-CD3 bispecific antibody in the US, and was indicated for the treatment of follicular lymphoma. In addition to Columvi, other CD20-CD3 contenders​ include Regeneron’s odronextamab and AbbVie’s epcoritamab.",['Jonathan Smith'],2023-03-30 00:00:00

Rather than just treating blood disorders, retinal diseases, neuromuscular and other diseases, we would eliminate them.

This is the present – and promise – of gene therapy. But gene-based therapy opens even more possibilities, and almost unlimited potential, beyond rare genetic disorders.

“It’s a new frontier,” says James Sabry, Global Head of Roche Pharma Partnering. “In many ways, the limitations are only what scientists can think of, and that’s really where the value of collaboration across Roche and with our current and future partners comes in.”

This mindset led to the acquisition of Spark Therapeutics, the Philadelphia-based gene therapy center of excellence within Roche.

“Imagine a world where no life is limited by genetic disease and the ambition of gene therapy to treat or possibly prevent disease is realized for the millions of people living with an inherited condition,” says Jeff Marrazzo, CEO and co-founder of Spark Therapeutics. “By addressing some diseases at a genetic level, entire lives, families and our global healthcare system could be transformed by unlocking the full potential of gene therapy.”

The next generation of pioneering medicines, with gene therapy front and centre, is blazing a path towards truly personalised global healthcare. It’s a proactive approach, strengthened by partnering and collaboration, that seeks better healthcare at a lower cost to society.

MWCC Associate Professor of English and Speech Provides

a Lesson in Chasing Your Passions

By Elysian Alder | Assistant Editor

Photo by Kara Roche

Associate Professor of English and Speech Kara Roche has been working at the Mount since 2007, and although English and teaching are two of her greatest passions, it’s the people – the community – that fill her with so much love for the college. Reflecting back on the journey she’s had to get to this point, Roche said, “Now I get to teach my two loves here: English classes filled with poetry and Shakespeare and speech classes. How lucky am I? My road taken turned out pretty well.”

After high school, Roche initially pursued her undergraduate degree in speech communications from Northeastern University. The onset of her path to higher education is one that may sound familiar to some. “I honestly had no idea what I wanted to do when it was time to go off to college,” she said. “I just knew I wanted to shed my high school skin and read and learn and meet engaging people to challenge me, close enough to home to visit.”

Roche confessed that it was love at first sight when it came to Northeastern, despite not having her precise trajectory mapped out right away. “The good news is that I LOVED college and really found myself there,” she enthused. “I loved philosophy, and it was actually a particular philosophy class (not English) that introduced me to E.E. Cummings and “Since Feeling Is First…” and pea-soup-crossed-legged nights where I fell in love with debating and reading and writing poetry myself with professors and classmates alike.” In addition to her extracurricular activities, hobbies, passions, and studies, Roche also had her own late-late-night radio show, making full use of her speech communications undergraduate degree and its concentration in radio and TV before deciding that another degree was calling her name. She went on to pursue English with a Secondary Education Certificate at Fitchburg State University, recalling the words of a high school English teacher and citing them as part of the reasoning behind her choice: “She said: ‘When you grow up and get your English degree, you can teach the way you want.’” And that is exactly what happened. Roche taught for 13 years at two high schools— Oakmont Regional High School and Nashoba Regional High School— wherein she created and helped implement a speech and debate curriculum. However, after having her two children, Roche began her career at the Mount in a part-time position working in the Visions program, as an adjunct professor and an advisor until September of 2012, when her position became a full-time gig, leading to where she is today.

As for what has made her time at the Mount most fulfilling and enjoyable, Roche says it’s simple: the people. “Not only my colleagues, but my students. The way everyone really cares,” she said. “How it’s not just a job. It’s a community.”

And although she’s exceedingly well-versed in the art of speechcraft, enjoys Button Poets , and has a particular love of spectating spoken verse poetry slams, Roche takes any chance she can get to continue to gush about her students. When asked about public speakers that she finds inspiring, she said, “My students are my favorite speakers and forever surprise me.” While familiar names such as Maya Angelou, Amanda Gorman, and Rudy Francisco also make the list, nothing tops her enthusiasm for her students. “I get to know my students so well in speech classes. They become vulnerable and honest and sincere. They grow like crazy. They are overwhelmingly kind. But beyond all that, they have REAL things to say. They have voices they might have been afraid to use. I get to listen. And I’ve had students make me cry, laugh out loud, challenge my point of view, and CHANGE me.”

These days, Roche has added yoga to her list of passions, which include supporting her children’s hobbies (her son’s sports and her daughter’s singing), traveling with her husband and family, and living it up to the fullest in the summertime. She still enjoys reading and writing, of course, and considers herself a lifelong learner— to the point that she participates in trivia nights. “Bet you didn’t know that it used to be forbidden for couples to kiss at train stations?” she imparted. “Yup. You’re welcome.”

A recent undertaking has her learning more about Massachusetts poets for a new virtual course. On the subject, she said, “I traveled the whole state and vlogged about several different poets, read their poetry, met locals who knew their poetry, and visited their gravesites and childhood homes, from P-Town to Great Barrington. I can’t believe how many treasures were hiding in a state I’ve been in my whole life, never mind the treasure of poets.” Kara Roche has inarguably had quite the journey to get where she is today. When asked if she’d give her past self any advice, none of it is academic— which comes as no surprise after hearing her enthusiasm for learning. Instead, she said, “Don’t be afraid to do those things you were too afraid to do. Try out for Lady Macbeth. Do every audition. Read your poetry aloud. Kiss that boy under the stars. Stay up late with your friends and catch snowflakes on your tongue. Jump into the Boston Common Frog Pond with your sneakers still on in summer. Raise your hand more in class. Don’t rush it. Live every moment, even the ones that ended in heartbreak. It goes too fast. And regret lasts too long.”","['April', 'Editorialteam On April']",2023-04-12 21:21:15+00:00

Ben Healy, 22, emulated the great Stephen Roche from 1982 and became just the third Irish rider in history to claim a podium finish by finishing second in the Amstel Gold Race on Sunday.

The result follows several electrifying performances this season, and Sunday's performance served as further evidence that the EF Education-EasyPost rider has attained the pinnacle of the sport.

After eliminating a number of sports greats, including Olympic Champion and British phenomenon Tom Pidcock in the final 10 kilometers.

Healy was only 40 seconds behind world number one and two-time Tour de France champion Tadej Pogacar. (UAE Team Emirates)

“I knew I had good legs, and I knew I had to ride a smart race as well to finish second today,” Healy said after the race.

“That’s what I did, and it paid off for me in the end.

“I was quietly confident. I rode a very aggressive race at Brabantse and I knew with a few bigger names here I would get the luxury of maybe missing few turns, which is what I did. It played to my advantage in the end.”

https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/03/20/is-roche-a-buy-now/,Is Roche a Buy Now?,"Swiss healthcare company Roche Holding (RHHBY -0.70%) doesn't trade on the NYSE or NASDAQ, so the company is sometimes overlooked considering its size, scope and consistent revenue growth.

Roche, with its roughly 140,000 employees, has increased revenue by 36% over the past 10 years and annual earnings per share (EPS) by 27% in that period.

However, over the past year, its shares have fallen 27%.

There are two likely reasons for the decline of Roche's shares. One, despite an up year for revenue in 2022, it is likely that its diagnostics sales will drop in 2023 because of fewer COVID-19 tests. The company, in its annual report, said the impact of reduced COVID-19 sales would bring down 2023 group sales to the low single digits.

The second reason is the company's trial failures last year. The best-known was the shuttering of trials for Alzheimer's therapy Gantenerumab. That decision came after the company announced in its mid-year earnings call that it was ending trials for prostate cancer therapy RG7440, metabolic disease drug G6338, breast cancer drug Giredestrant, and asthma drug RG6173.

Despite the negative news, there are plenty of reasons to like the 125-year-old company's stock, which trades at around 17 times earnings, below the pharmaceutical industry average and below similar competitors such as Johnson & Johnson and AbbVie.

Here are a few reasons to like Roche stock:

Consistently strong performance

The company, which operates in two segments, Pharmaceutical and Diagnostic, had strong earnings in 2022, with CHF 62.3 billion in revenue, up 1%, and yearly EPS of CHF 20.30, up 2%.

While Pharmaceutical sales were up 1% to CHF 45.5 billion, Diagnostic sales were CHF 17.7 billion, flat year over year. The company said it expects declining revenue this year from COVID-19-related tests, but that should be made up by increasing revenue from two new products. Vabysmo, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last January to treat two serious eye diseases, brought in $639.4 million in revenue, and Lunsumio, approved on Dec. 28 by the FDA to treat relapsed or refractory lymphoma, has the potential for $2 billion in peak annual sales.

Big portfolio, huge pipeline, recent approval success

The company's top-selling drug is multiple sclerosis therapy Ocrevus, which had CHF 6 billion in revenue in 2022, up 17%.

The company has a particular focus on oncology therapies, which makes sense. According to a report by Precedence Research, the oncology market is expected to grow from $286 billion in 2021 to over $581 billion by 2030, a compound annual growth rate of 8.2%.

Roche has multiple oncology blockbusters, led by breast cancer therapy Perjeta (CHF 4.087 billion in 2022 sales) and Tecentriq, approved for urothelial carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer (CHF 3.717 billion). Roche's other top-selling oncology therapies include Herceptin, approved to treat stomach cancer and breast cancer (CHF 2.142 billion), and Avastin, approved to treat ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, kidney cancer, and glioblastoma (CHF 2.122 billion).

The most promising drug in the pipeline may be Glofitamab, which has shown promise to treat patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Glofitamab is a bispecific antibody that recruits T cells to fight tumor cells.

Another drug showing potential is Fenebrutinib, which is in a Phase 3 trial to treat relapsed and primary progressive multiple sclerosis. The drug is a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor.

Since the start of the year, the company's newer drug candidates have made big news. On March 10, Polivy, used in combination with Rituxan plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (R-CHP) on previously untreated patients with DLBCL, gained an 11-2 approval vote from the FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee. It's the first treatment in over two decades to show clinically meaningful improvement over the standard of care for first-line DLBCL. The FDA is expected to make a decision on the drug's approval by April 2. The drug has the potential for $2.4 billion in peak sales, analysts have said.

In February, Vabysmo met its primary endpoint in two trials to treat macular edema from branch and central retinal vein occlusion. If approved, it would be the third indication for the therapy, in addition to ""wet"" age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema.

The company also received a label expansion from the FDA for Ventana PD-L1 as an assay to identify non-small cell lung cancer patients eligible for treatment with Libtayo, a PD-1 inhibitor developed by Regeneron.

Roche has a huge pipeline of 160 programs, including 47 in Phase 3 trials. Some of those late-stage therapies will likely pay off, helping the company to replace sales of its top drugs that are facing biosimilar competition, such as Rituxan, Herceptin, and Avastin.

An above-average dividend

Roche just raised its annual dividend by 2% to $1.29 per share, which equates to a yield of around 3.5%, double that of the typical S&P 500 dividend. Its dividend payout ratio of roughly 49% means the company can likely continue to increase its dividend.

Roche spends big to stay big

The reason Roche's pipeline is so large is that it is willing to spend more money on research and development than other pharmaceutical companies. In 2021, the magazine Drug Discovery and Development studied the top R&D pharmaceutical spenders, and Roche spent 27% of its revenue on R&D, a much larger share than any other large pharmaceutical.

Coming up with new therapies isn't cheap, and there are bound to be a few failures along the way, but Roche spends to keep finding novel therapies to replace the ones that will eventually lose exclusivity. It's already looking long down the road, and this stock is a good pick for long-term investors, particularly at its current price.",['Jim Halley'],2023-03-20 00:00:00
https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/roche-buys-back-shares-family-group-reduces-voting-stake-drugmaker-2023-02-10/,Roche buys back shares as family group reduces voting stake in drugmaker,"













ZURICH, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Roche (ROG.S) has bought 540,000 of its own shares, the company said on Friday, as a member of its controlling family group scaled back their investment in voting shares at the pharmaceuticals maker.

The Roche Long Term Foundation, which buys shares for the equity component of staff's compensation plans, bought 20% of the 2.7 million bearer shares put up for sale by a member of the Hoffmann-Oeri family.

The total shares on offer were equivalent to 2.5% of the voting equity of the cancer drug maker.

A member of the family shareholding group - heirs of Roche founder Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche - sold part of their stake in the accelerated book build run by UBS.

""Following this transaction, the shareholder group with pooled voting rights owns circa 65% (previously 67.5%) of the issued share capital of Roche,"" the company said on Friday.

""The bearer shares bought by Roche will be held as treasury shares. These shares will not be canceled.""

Roche did not comment on which family member sold the stake, or whether further sales were planned. No details were given of the other buyers of remaining shares offered in the sales.

The shares were bought for 307 francs per share, a discount of 7.6% to the closing share price of bearer shares on Thursday, giving Roche's acquisition a value of 165.78 million Swiss francs ($180 million).

Bearer shares at Roche , which make up 13.2% of the company's share capital, come with voting rights and are traded separately to the more common ordinary shares which carry only a financial interest.

CHICAGO, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche (ROG.S) is closing down most clinical trials of its experimental Alzheimer's drug gantenerumab after it failed to slow advance of the mind-robbing disease in a pair of large, late-stage studies, the company said on Wednesday.

Roche presented full results of twin trials at an Alzheimer's meeting in San Francisco after announcing in November that the drug had failed in the two trials. read more

Unlike Eisai Co Ltd (4523.T) and Biogen Inc's (BIIB.O) lecanemab, which appears to be on track for U.S. regulatory approval after presenting successful trial results on Tuesday, Roche's drug did not show a statistically significant benefit in patients with mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's disease.

Both drugs are designed to remove forms of the protein beta amyloid from the brain, sticky plaques believed to play a major role in the disease.

While Eisai's infusion succeeded in slowing the advance of Alzheimer's by 27% after 18 months, Roche's drug reduced decline by just 8% in the Graduate I study and 6% in the Graduate II study compared with a placebo after two years.

A key difference may have been in the drug's ability to clear amyloid from the brain.

In a presentation on Wednesday, researchers said gantenerumab, which is given by injection, only achieved amyloid clearance in 28% of patients in the Graduate I trial and 25% in Graduate II after two years, half of what the company expected to see.

Lecanemab, by contrast, cleared amyloid in 68% of those in the study after 18 months.

Dr. Howard Fillit, chief science officer at the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation, said there are a number of reasons why Roche's drug may have failed, including differences in chemistry, dosing and the way it was administered via injection versus infusion.

But the fact that the drug failed to remove amyloid deposits in the brain as expected clearly played a role, he added.

The field of Alzheimer's research is littered with failure and disappointment, including for several drugs in the same class, and previous efforts to prove gantenerumab's worth.

In 2014, the drug failed to show a benefit when given at a lower dose among patients with mild Alzheimer's, and it failed again in 2020 in a Washington University School of Medicine trial of patients with an inherited form of Alzheimer's.

""Obviously, within the class, some drugs are working and some aren't,"" Fillet said.

A Roche spokesman said in an emailed statement that the company will stop all gantenerumab studies in early Alzheimer's disease, including extension studies of the Graduate trials and the Skyline Phase III study in patients with evidence of amyloid in the brain but no signs of cognitive decline.

""In the Graduate studies, the level of amyloid removal was lower than expected. We expect the same, lower effect in the Skyline population, and consider this insufficient to continue,"" the spokesman said.

Roche is still testing a different formulation of gantenerumab called trontinemab, designed to ferry the drug across the blood brain barrier - protective blood vessels that prevent chemicals in the bloodstream from entering the brain - in hopes of getting more of the treatment into the brain.

""We remain committed to Alzheimer’s disease and will direct our focus to new and potentially improved approaches for new treatments,"" Rachelle Doody, Roche's global head of neurodegeneration drug development, said in a statement.

To cap off the first quarter, the FDA will decide on two investigational treatments: one for opioid overdose, the other for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The regulator will also convene a meeting to discuss risk management for acne pills.

Here are the details.

Emergent Seeks OTC Access for Opioid Overdose Nasal Spray

On March 29, the FDA will decide on Emergent BioSolutions’ supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Narcan (naloxone HCI) Nasal Spray. The company is hoping to have Narcan approved as an over the counter (OTC) emergency treatment for confirmed or suspected opioid overdose.

Currently, patients need a doctor’s prescription to access Narcan. The drug is an opioid antagonist that works by competing with the same receptor. When administered as an emergency medication, Narcan can reverse symptoms of opioid overdose, including sedation and hypotension.

The FDA accepted Emergent’s sNDA for Narcan in December 2022 and granted it Priority Review Status. The company backed its OTC bid with human studies and more than five-years’ worth of post-marketing data showing that Narcan is both safe and effective.

In February 2023, the FDA’s Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee and the Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee convened to discuss Narcan’s sNDA, weighing the benefits versus potential risks of removing the drug’s prescription requirement. The panel voted unanimously, 19-0, in favor of the OTC application.

Roche’s Polivy in Frontline in DLBCL

On April 2, the FDA will release its decision on Genentech (Roche’s) sBLA to use Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin-piiq) in combination with the R-CHP chemotherapy regimen in previously untreated DLBCL.

Polivy first won accelerated approval in June 2019 in this indication and to keep it on the market, Genentech ran the Phase III POLARIX trial, data from which also supported the sBLA.

In POLARIX, Polivy with the R-CHP regimen improved progression-free survival by 27%, indicating that the study met its primary endpoint.

However, the FDA was dissatisfied with Polivy’s magnitude of effect. In briefing documents ahead of an advisory committee meeting in March, Agency staffers wrote that it is questionable whether this rate of difference is clinically meaningful.

The regulator also flagged Polivy’s lack of significant benefit in terms of overall survival and complete response.

Despite these reservations, the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee, a panel of independent experts, voted 11-2 in favor of Polivy.

FDA Convenes Expert Panel for Isotretinoin REMS

On March 28 and 29, the FDA will hold a joint meeting between its Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee and the Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee.

The two committees will discuss proposed changes to the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program for isotretinoin oral capsules to minimize the burden on patients, pharmacies and prescribers.

Isotretinoin, sold under the brand name Accutane, among others, is an oral medication for severe acne. In 2005, the FDA established the iPLEDGE Program, which was designed to help prevent fetal exposure to isotretinoin, which has been shown to pose birth defects. The iPLEDGE REMS program covers all FDA-approved isotretinoin products and is a centralized system to manage related risks.

In December 2021, the FDA implemented modifications to iPLEDGE REMS which involved reducing patient risk categories from three to two. Under the new REMS classification, prescribers can only classify their patients as those who can get pregnant and those who can’t.

The changes also affected pharmacies, requiring them to obtain a risk management authorization before dispensing isotretinoin.",[],

There’s no cure for rosacea and, similar to acne and eczema, it can be hard to keep at bay. According to dermatologists, the best way to prevent flare ups is to avoid triggers – which unfortunately can include many popular skin care ingredients. We spoke to dermatologists about skin care products that won’t aggravate rosacea, as well as treatments and ingredients that can actually help tame flare-ups.

The best products for rosacea in April 2023

Our experts said that a skin routine with gentle, non-abrasive products is best for people with rosacea. Below, we compiled expert-recommended moisturizers, facial cleansers, serums, sunscreens and more to help tame redness and irritation from rosacea. All of the products listed contain gentle, hydrating and brightening ingredients that can help soothe irritated skin — including niacinamide, hyaluronic acid and aloe — and are fragrance-free to avoid further irritation.

Best cleansers for rosacea

Pros: Free of harsh cleansing ingredients; Our testers say it's great for daily use

Cons: When our testers tried it, it didn't remove all makeup

“For people who are really sensitive and report that a lot of products burn or sting their skin, I’ll recommend the Vanicream line of products, which are great for people who have eczema and sensitive skin in general — a lot of patients with rosacea find it to be very tolerable,” said Dr. Emmy Graber, a board-certified dermatologist and president of The Dermatology Institute of Boston. The Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser boasts the National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance — the program evaluates products based on the NEA’s criteria of ingredients and contents to ensure they’re beneficial for people with sensitive skin.

Our experts also recommend the brand’s moisturizing cream for very sensitive and dry skin, which is also one of our favorite products for dry skin.

Pros: Our testers found it to be good for oily skin; fragrance-free

Cons: Our editors found it may contribute to extra dryness if you're prone to drier skin

Foaming cleansers can sometimes be too harsh on the skin — they contain foaming agents that remove most of the oil on the face, which can lead to even more dryness and flaking. Though our experts recommended avoiding most foaming cleansers on the market if you have sensitive skin, there are a few that can be safe for the rosacea community, like this one from Aveeno. “It recognizes that, by adding calming and hydrating ingredients to balance the foam of the cleanser, those that need their soap to foam to feel clean can enjoy the overall experience while limiting the risk of excess dryness,” Ilyas noted.

Pros: Our testers agreed it's very gentle on the skin and doesn't dry out the skin thanks to gel-like consistency; affordable

Cons: When I tried it, it didn't remove all eye makeup

Cetaphil’s Gentle Skin Cleanser is recommended by dermatologists thanks to its gentle, non-foaming formula that helps hydrate and soothe rosacea-prone skin. Select managing editor Leah Ginsberg said she’s used the Cetaphil cleanser since she was 16 years old and loves that it's both affordable and gentle on her skin. “It's also great for travel because you don't have to rinse it off with water — you can massage it in and then (gently) wipe it off,” she said.

Pros: We found the no-rinse formula to be great for travel; fragrance-free; Our testers liked it for dry skin types

Cons: More expensive than other options

Both Graber and Soza recommended Avene’s redness-relief line as a great option for people with rosacea who hope to calm irritation. This cleaning lotion from the brand is a no-rinse face wash that can gently remove makeup, dirt and oil — Avene recommends applying this cleansing lotion daily using a cotton pad or your fingers and wiping off any excess using a cotton pad.

Pros: Affordable; The brand says it can be used for face and body; fragrance-free

Cons: We found it to not work well for travel due to the storage of the bar

Bodemer noted that the Dove Beauty Bar can be “a really good, easy cleanser that people can find inexpensively.” The hypoallergenic formula is safe to use as both a facial cleanser and body soap, and it contains mild and moisturizing ingredients like glycerin that can help maintain the skin’s natural moisture barrier, according to the brand.

Best moisturizers for rosacea

Pros: Experts have told us it's great for acne-prone skin; The brand says the hyaluronic acid provides moisture; oil-free

Cons: We found that it doesn't moisturize enough for winter or extreme dry skin

One of our favorite moisturizers for acne-prone skin, this nighttime moisturizing lotion from CeraVe contains ceramides that “can help restore the skin barrier to soothe rosacea-prone skin,” Ilyas said. You can also purchase the brand’s AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion for the daytime, which has a gentle formula and offers SPF 30 protection.

Pros: We found it to be not greasy, absorbs quickly and goes on smoothly

Cons: More expensive than comparable options

Clinique’s Redness Solutions skin care line offers cleansers, moisturizers, sunscreens and more that can be beneficial for those with redness and rosacea. “[The products] come out looking like a green color but don’t look green on your face — they work to mask or camouflage the red color,” Graber explained. She said the brand’s Daily Relief Cream is a great option for those with a lot of redness: The cream not reduces the appearance of redness, but also works to gently calm irritated skin, according to the brand.

Pros: Lightweight; We found it to be good for nighttime use, goes on smoothly and feels luxurious

Cons: N/A

Like Avene, La Roche-Posay is a French brand that makes gentle products for sensitive skin — our experts recommended this brand for both rosacea and acne-prone skin. I use La Roche-Posay’s Toleriane Double Repair moisturizer every night since it’s both gentle on my rosacea and hydrating enough to keep my flaky, dry skin at bay. The moisturizer contains ceramides and niacinamide, which Ilyas said can help soothe and calm rosacea flare-ups. I pair this moisturizer with the brand’s Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser, which is a gel face wash that maintains my skin’s moisture and doesn’t irritate it (unlike most other cleansers).

Pros: Lightweight; The brand says it's good for face and body

Cons: We found it to be not great for extreme dryness

Much like Cetaphil's gentle skin cleanser, the brand's moisturizing lotion can be a great option for those with very sensitive skin. An expert favorite, the moisturizer has a non-greasy, paraben-free formula with no added fragrance to avoid irritation for rosacea skin, the brand says. It can also provide up to 24 hours of hydration, according to the brand. If you're looking for a daytime moisturizer option from the brand, its Redness Relieving Daily Facial Moisturizer comes with SPF 20 for some sun protection and a tinted formula to reduce the appearance of redness.

Best serums and treatments for rosacea

Pros: Inexpensive compared to other similar options; Our experts say the actives help to heal acne scars; Our testers think its great under makeup

Cons: Experts say it may react with other actives like salicylic acid

Both Graber and Ilyas recommended The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Serum to help improve redness and generally even out skin tone, including any dark spots caused by bumps and blemishes. The serum contains 10% azelaic acid and is cruelty-free, vegan and gentle enough to use up to twice a day, according to The Ordinary.

Pros: We thought that it was great under makeup; The brand says it has green-colored particles to immediately reduce the appearance of redness

Cons: May not work on all skin types

The Inkey List’s Azelaic Acid Serum, which is recommended by Ilyas, is similar to The Ordinary’s serum — both formulas contain 10% azelaic acid and can be applied twice a day, according to both brands. If redness is a major concern, The Inkey List’s serum contains micro-fine green-colored particles that can help mask redness, as well as 0.3% allantoin, which is a chemical compound that can help soothe the skin, the brand says.

Pros: The brand and experts say it is good for smoothing wrinkles and fighting acne

Cons: Takes several weeks to work

Though retinoids can often be too harsh on sensitive skin, they can still work for rosacea-prone skin if they’re introduced slowly, starting with just once a week before building up tolerance. “I find the best approach is to first create a simplified routine that directly addresses the rosacea, followed by consideration of adding retinols and retinoids once inflammation in the skin is under better control,” Ilyas said. She noted that adapalene gel — an OTC retinoid treatment that can be used to treat mild to moderate acne and blackheads — is considered a milder retinoid compared to other options like tretinoin and tazarotene. Because of this, both she and Soza recommended Differin Gel — which contains 0.1% adapalene— as a suitable anti-aging and acne-fighting option for people with rosacea.

Best sunscreens for rosacea

Pros: We found during our testing that it won't clog pores; great for acne-prone skin; moisturizing; great under makeup

Cons: Needs to be reapplied throughout the day

The EltaMD UV Clear Sunscreen is a favorite among our experts since it’s free of heavy moisturizers that could clog pores. It also contains niacinamide, which acts as a natural anti-inflammatory ingredient for rosacea. The mineral-based sunscreen offers SPF 46 protection and includes zinc oxide, which experts previously told us provides protection against the sun's UVA and UVB rays while soothing the skin. This EltaMD sunscreen is the only one I’ve tried that doesn’t flare up my rosacea. Similarly, Ginsberg said she uses it on her fair, sensitive skin every day following her dermatologist’s recommendation because it doesn’t cause flare-ups for her, either. “I [also] love the texture and it never burns my eyes if I sweat,” she said.

Pros: Tinted for a sheer finish; The brand says it smoothes fines lines and wrinkles; lightweight

Cons: More expensive than other sunscreen options

One of our favorite mineral sunscreens, the Isdin Eryfotona Ageless tinted sunscreen can provide some coverage to cover up redness and protect the skin against rosacea’s biggest trigger, according to Soza. It also contains peptides and antioxidants to also help minimize signs of aging like fine lines and wrinkles, the brand says.

Pros: Affordable; water resistant; The brand says it won't clog pores

Cons: Leaves a white cast on darker skin tones, according to testers

Ilyas said she typically recommends Vanicream sunscreen to her patients because it provides broad-spectrum protection with SPF 50. The mineral sunscreen is water-resistant for up to 80 minutes and can be great for sensitive skin since it only contains one active ingredient (zinc oxide) and no dyes, fragrances or parabens, according to the brand.

What causes rosacea?

Rosacea is best known as an inflammatory skin condition — the skin reacts to a trigger, which results in broken blood vessels and an increased sensitivity of the skin overall, according to Dr. Erum Ilyas, a board-certified dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology. Unlike most people who have a baseline level of redness to their complexion, people with rosacea can experience recurrent flushing and bumps that look like acne breakouts, which can be accompanied by warmth, burning, itching and other skin sensitivities, Ilyas said.

Though rosacea breakouts may look like adult acne, they don’t behave as such: “You go to pop the ‘pimple,’ but they don’t really come to a head [and] they just get angrier at you — this is followed by the skin starting to swell or thicken, taking on an ‘orange-peel’ appearance with widened patulous pores,” Ilyas explained.

The location of the bumps on your face can also help you figure out whether they’re the result of rosacea. “Hormonal acne or other forms of adult acne tend to involve more of the lower face, whereas with rosacea we see the involvement of the nose, the central part of the cheeks and the center of the forehead,” said Dr. Apple Bodemer, a board-certified dermatologist and associate professor of dermatology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.

Triggers for rosacea flare-ups vary from person to person, but the most common ones are sun exposure and heat — other triggers include alcohol, spicy foods, hot beverages and chocolate. “I like to joke with my patients that all the fun things in life can trigger rosacea,” said Dr. Gabriela Soza, a board-certified dermatologist at Wexler Dermatology. Bodemer added that emotional triggers can also be a cause of rosacea for many people.

Bodemer advised keeping a symptom diary to track when you flare up and jotting down what you did before that flare-up, including what you ate. “I see people who are very sensitive to simple carbohydrates, so when they're eating more junk food and more processed sugars they will tend to flare more,” Bodemer said.

How to manage rosacea

Since there isn’t a known cure for rosacea, Soza recommended figuring out your specific triggers and finding ways to avoid them. You should also focus on wearing a mineral-based sunscreen with broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher to avoid further redness and irritation on sensitive skin. “I cannot emphasize the importance of sun protection and sunscreen enough,” Soza said. Mineral sunscreens (also called physical blockers) contain zinc oxide or titanium dioxide rather than a chemical base — they don’t absorb into the skin and can be less irritating for those with sensitive, rosacea-prone skin, Soza explained.

Because people with rosacea tend to have dry and flaky skin that’s both sensitive and reactive, they’re more likely to have certain reactions to cosmetics and personal care products, Bodemer said. While crafting a gentle skin care routine, it’s important to first see a board-certified dermatologist who can evaluate your rosacea and come up with a treatment plan, which may include one or more prescription medications like doxycycline (an oral antibiotic) and metronidazole (a topical treatment).

Medication isn’t always necessary, though. There are many over-the-counter ingredients that can be beneficial for patients with rosacea, many of which can serve as anti-inflammatories before a prescription is needed, according to Ilyas.

Niacinamide and hyaluronic acid are great ingredients to look for when developing a rosacea-friendly skin care routine. “Niacinamide is calming [and] will decrease the redness associated with rosacea, and hyaluronic acid is moisturizing, which is also super important if you have rosacea,” Soza said. Aloe and ceramides can help soothe and calm red and irritated skin. Ilyas noted that these ingredients can work to restore the skin’s moisture barrier and prevent it from drying out. Azelaic acid and topical sulfur are gentle ingredients that work well on sensitive skin — they help unclog pores to prevent and diminish bumps caused by rosacea, and they work to even out your skin tone by reducing redness and inflammation of the skin. “Azelaic acid is even FDA-approved for rosacea to help treat the inflammatory papules and pustules (red bumps and whitehead-like breakouts),” Soza said.

What type of products should you avoid with rosacea?

Ilyas advised taking a “less is more” approach when crafting a skin care routine for rosacea. “Taking a closer look at your skincare products, eliminating redundancy and choosing multitasking products can reduce the volume of products used that can potentially aggravate the skin over time,” she said. This means skipping out on common skin care additions like toners (including witch hazel and alcohol-based toners that can aggravate rosacea), acne treatments, anti-aging products and exfoliants.

Be mindful of certain acne treatments

People may look toward acne treatments to help with rosacea bumps, but that can make rosacea worse, according to Ilyas. “Although people can get breakouts with rosacea, they are not the same — anyone with rosacea that has tried to ‘pop’ their pimples will tell you it doesn’t work,” Ilyas said. Our experts recommended avoiding acne-fighting products with harsh ingredients like benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, which can be irritating on sensitive, rosacea-prone skin — both Ilyas and Soza recommended using azelaic acid to control acne instead. Ilyas also suggested avoiding fragrances and comedogenic products that clog pores, which is in line with our experts’ guidance for sensitive skin.

Limit your usage of anti-aging products

Graber said that anti-aging products can dry out the skin and sometimes cause flare-ups of rosacea, so it’s best to avoid them if you have moderate to severe rosacea. “Some of the retinol or retinoid products can make people with rosacea more red — same with some of the glycolic acids that are typically in a lot of popular anti-aging products,” she said. However, Soza noted that people with mild rosacea don’t necessarily have to stay away from anti-aging products altogether. “You should ease into it and take it slow — start applying once a week, increasing frequency as you build tolerance,” she said.

Soza also recommended applying a small pea-sized amount to the full face, and using the “moisturizer sandwich technique,” which means you moisturize, apply the retinoid or retinol and then moisturize again. “This will help your skin stay hydrated while still maintaining efficacy,” she noted.

Avoid harsh exfoliants

We often hear about exfoliation as a key step in any weekly skin care routine, and people with rosacea may be tempted to exfoliate to help reduce the flaky dead skin caused by the condition. However, both Bodemer and Graber said they tell their patients with rosacea to avoid exfoliating altogether. “The more you inflame the skin [with exfoliants], the more flaking you're going to have,” Bodemer said, explaining that the flaking on the skin is a manifestation of the inflammation caused by rosacea. Graber added that “any products that have beads, require scrubbing or even have chemical exfoliants in them [are] just too much for somebody with rosacea.” If you’re really insistent on exfoliating, Graber recommended simply using water and a soft washcloth.

Ilyas also recommended limiting or avoiding the use of alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), which serve as chemical exfoliants. “Although people with rosacea may use these for anti-aging benefits, care should be taken to avoid excess irritation — rosacea alone can make the skin sensitive and adding in chemical exfoliation can aggravate this irritation,” she said.

Healy matched the best Irish result in the Dutch one-day Classic 41 years after Stephen Roche finished second behind five-time home winner Jan Raas. The 22-year-old Healy finished behind two-time Tour de France winner Tadej Pogacar (UAE Emirates) after spending much of the 253km-long race in the front group.

Healy, who also finished second in Belgian Classic Brabantse Pijl on Wednesday, was part of a 16-strong group that went clear at the front with about 100km of racing remaining.

“At that point we still had Neilson (Powless) behind,” Healy told Independent.ie. “He was our main leader for the team, so I kind of got a free ride. I was still rolling through but not really pulling hard turns which definitely helped me in the finale.

“Then, as we got closer to the finish, it was a super attritional race. A lot of guys were hurting in that break. You really had to race carefully today, because an important move could happen at any time. Those kind of circumstances suit me well but I think other riders had more trouble with that.""

Of that front group, only Healy and British rider Tom Pidcock (Ineos Grenadiers) were able to follow an attack by Pogacar on the climb of the Eyserbosweg with 36km to go.

Pogacar, who has taken three stage victories and the overall at both Paris-Nice and the Vuelta a Andalucia this year as well as the cobbled Belgian Monument the Tour of Flanders, shrugged off an earlier bike change to drive open a gap to the chasers before simply riding his fellow escapees off his wheel on the climb of the Kautenberg with 28km to go.

Although Healy lost contact first, the EF Education-Easypost pro managed to claw his way back up to Pidcock and the duo put in a concerted chase before Healy attacked his former Trinity Racing team-mate with 14km to go.

“We kept working pretty well together, but the first time up the Cauberg I could just feel that his legs were hurting so I gave it a dig on the next climb,” said Healy, whose strong time-trialling skills saw him close to within 20 seconds of Pogacar at one point before growing out to 38 seconds by the line, where a very impressive Healy finished a minute and a half clear of Pidcock to claim the second step on the podium.

“I had a bit of a ride to the finish but it was good,” said the 22-year-old. “I think that dig closed the gap a bit but as soon as Pogacar heard the gap was coming down he clearly had more in reserve and pulled away again. The legs were good today so it was nice to prove to myself that I can do it in good company. Second to the best in the world, I can’t be unhappy with that.”

With two victories already under his belt and two white jerseys for best young rider at the Tour de Pays Loire and the Coppi e Bartali stage races respectively, it’s been a breakout season for Healy, who tackles Fleche-Wallonne on Wednesday and Liege-Bastogne-Liege on Sunday.

“I really took a step up this year, which is great. The legs were very good again today and I hope to continue this run of form.”

Healy’s podium placing capped a great weekend for young Irish riders as Darren Rafferty took fifth place in the U-23 Liege-Bastogne-Liege classic on Saturday, just days after finishing in the same position at the prestigious Giro del Belvedere U-23 race. Meanwhile, Offaly rider Megan Armitage finished fourth at the Grand Prix Feminin de Chambery.",[],

There is hope for every team, even if the expectations for this year's Red Sox are pretty low.

That is, unless you're WBZ-TV's Dan Roche. The eternal optimist when it comes to Boston's baseball team, Rochie has faith that the Red Sox will be better than people expect this season. He's not promising a deep playoff run -- or the team just making the playoffs -- but he does foresee a fun summer ahead at Fenway Park.

That will all start Thursday afternoon, when the Red Sox open their 2023 campaign against the Baltimore Orioles at Fenway Park. And to get everyone ready for the season, and feeling good about these Sox, Rochie prepared a poem that he read during an appearance on 98.5 The Sports Hub's Toucher & Rich on Thursday morning:

Opening Day is finally here

Man it's been a while

The Sox and baseball are back

That will make you smile

It was a tough offseason for Henry and Sam

To whom Sox fans scream ""You don't give a damn!""

And you have to feel for Chaim Bloom

He hears nothing but ""Doom, doom, and gloom""

Have you seen Masataka Yoshida?

He's got pretty good range

And how about his WBC

When he turned on that change?

Watch Devers, Turner, and Duvall

About 100 times this year

They'll touch them all

Pitching?

Well, Kluber and Sale won't fail

If they could just stay healthy

That would help

With Houck, and Whit, and Bello

The staff could be healthy

Don't worry about Wallach the Eagle

As he continues to pout

Just like Felger & Mazz

I'll tune them out

So as we begin

All I have to say

Is ""Enjoy yourself""

It's Opening Day

There is no way WBZ-TV can let a treasure like Dan Roche get away. But perhaps he's got a side gig as the Red Sox poet laureate in his near future.","['Wbz-News Staff', 'The Wbz News Team Is A Group Of Experienced Journalists Who Bring You The Content On Wbz.Com.']",

YouTube

Precocity has become the norm in the TikTok-teened, Disney-fied pop world. But to my ears, none of the self-possessed wiz kids making bank today approach the wisdom and unfettered wit Maggie Roche possessed when she was 17. Roche, who died at 65 in 2017, was the anchor voice and primary songwriter in the scandalously undersung sister trio The Roches, whose catalog remains one of music's most inventive and enriching. Earlier on, she and sister Terre had a high-school duo who toured the U.S. and made an album, Seductive Reasoning, with the help of Paul Simon. Now Terre tells that story in a keepsake-like book and accompanying anthology of recordings compiled from early live bootlegs, studio outtakes and tracks from a tour the two sisters did in 2000.

As she absorbed the influences of master music crafters like Simon and Ry Cooder, Maggie began honing her unique gift for infusing wordplay-heavy magical-realist narratives with shocks of insight, particularly about how family and gender roles shape the lives of even the freest thinkers. She found in her sister Terre (who only occasionally wrote at this point) a mirror and a ballast: Terre's high, elastic voice could do things Maggie's contralto could not, and their intimacy made her interpretations of Maggie's versified thoughts highly intuitive. In a way, bending notes and tracing rhythms, Terre is always an author, too.

The Roches' blend of distinctly slanted harmonies, vaudevillian humor and poignancy is all there in ""Moonruns,"" a Seductive Reasoning outtake that's hardly long enough to be a saga, yet cultivates all those seeds. Terre sings lead; Maggie's words tell the tale. Maggie remembers how, as a girl — already aware of ""a world of difference"" splitting her off from the boys she admired — she longed to hit a homer with Gary, a dreamy fourth grader on a local baseball team. The song paints the scene in saturated color, of Maggie peering through the dugout fence and watching the balls fly, seeing them as ""moonruns,"" an allusion to the astronauts who also were all the rage then, and all men. ""I was a third-grade fan,"" she puns, ""but that was in the days before I was cool."" So began a lifetime of pondering how and why some women can become cool and others never will; of thinking about freedom and equality, life's promise and love's cost.",['Ann Powers'],2022-11-03 00:00:00
https://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/roche_and_eli_lilly_to_collaborate_on_alzheimers_disease_blood_test_1490047,Roche and Eli Lilly to collaborate on Alzheimer’s disease blood test,"Roche has announced a partnership with Eli Lilly aimed at developing a blood test for Alzheimer’s disease which, if approved, could help streamline the journey to diagnosis for more patients.

Affecting more than 6.5 million Americans alone, Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out simple tasks.

A timely diagnosis allows patients and their physicians to make important decisions about treatment, support and care. However, barriers to early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer’s exist worldwide, with up to 75% of people living with the symptoms of the disease, but without a diagnosis.

Roche’s Elecsys Amyloid Plasma Panel (EAPP) test, which has already been given breakthrough device designation in the US, would be an additional tool to determine whether symptomatic individuals should proceed to further evaluation and testing that may confirm a diagnosis.

The test works by detecting traces of the toxic protein beta amyloid, which builds up in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.

Matt Sause, chief executive officer of Roche Diagnostics, said: “We are excited to be collaborating with Lilly on such an important area of unmet medical need.

“Today, over 55 million people are living with dementia and this is projected to increase to nearly 140 million by 2050. Collaboration is essential to ensure these people receive a timely and accurate diagnosis.”

Mark Mintun, Lilly group vice president – neuroscience R&D and president, Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, added: ""We look forward to the robust data and continued collaboration across the field that will be critical to accelerate the ecosystem to aid in a timely and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer’s.""

The partnership comes just two months after Eisai and Biogen’s Alzheimer’s drug Leqembi (lecanemab-irmb) received accelerated approval in the US for patients at early stages of the disease, underpinning the need for timely diagnosis.

The decision from the US Food and Drug Administration was based on phase 2 data showing that Leqembi reduced the accumulation of amyloid beta plaque in the brain.

The drug has since been granted priority review for traditional approval in the US, with the application supported by phase 3 results demonstrating a reduction in clinical decline by 27% on the global cognitive and functional scale compared with placebo at 18 months.","['Emily Kimber', 'Article By']",

Accurate, fast and easy to use, the Pilot COVID-19 At-Home Test is the first over-the-counter test launched by Roche Diagnostics in the U.S.

Following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance for at-home testing and appropriate next steps can help reduce the spread of COVID-19.

INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced a new name and brand for the COVID-19 At-Home Test – Pilot® COVID-19 At-Home Test, which debuts this week nationwide.

The Pilot COVID-19 At-Home Test distributed by Roche Diagnostics is available at CVS, Amazon and in the Optum Store. Tweet this The COVID-19 At-Home Test distributed by Roche, which tens of millions of Americans received via the U.S. government, Amazon and the Optum Store, is available under a new name and brand - Pilot® COVID-19 At-Home Test. The Pilot-branded test is now available over-the-counter at CVS Pharmacy, in addition to Amazon and the Optum Store.

The Pilot COVID-19 At-Home Test, the first over-the-counter test distributed in the U.S. by Roche Diagnostics, received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 24, 2021¹, and is manufactured by SD Biosensor Inc. The test has been distributed to tens of millions of Americans via the U.S. government's efforts to expand access to testing earlier this year. It uses a simple anterior nasal swab sample that can be conveniently self-collected and self-tested by individuals ages 14 years and older, and by an adult for children ages 2 to 13 years old.² The Pilot COVID-19 At-Home Test is able to produce accurate, reliable and quick results in as few as 20 minutes for SARS-CoV-2.

""Great progress has been made to make COVID-19 testing easy and universal,"" said Matt Sause, president and CEO of Roche Diagnostics North America. ""We are excited that the Pilot test offers convenience and broad accessibility for frequent testing needs, whether for a known exposure or safety for group settings.""

With a relative sensitivity of 93.2% and a relative specificity of 100%3, the Pilot COVID-19 At-Home Test can help you determine your next step, such as self-isolation for COVID-19, seeking further testing, and pursuing advice from a healthcare professional about treatment options, or ending isolation with two confirmed negative results.

Taking an at-home COVID-19 test is recommended by the CDC when you: have any COVID-19 symptoms; were exposed to someone with COVID-19; or are going to an indoor event or gathering. If you test negative, consider repeating the test 48 hours later. Receiving multiple negative test results increases the confidence that you are not infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. If you have symptoms, although serial testing may be useful, seeing a healthcare provider should be considered because multiple viruses including the flu are currently circulating.

The Pilot COVID-19 At-Home Test is available at CVS Pharmacy and cvs.com , Amazon and in the Optum Store .

In March 2020, Roche became the first company to launch a commercial COVID-19 PCR test running on high-throughput laboratory instruments. The company has developed more than 20 COVID-19 tests and solutions globally, and sold more than 1.8 billion COVID-19 tests worldwide since the beginning of the pandemic. Roche offers high-quality solutions for every setting, from large reference laboratories to at-home testing.

About Pilot COVID-19 At-Home Test

The Pilot COVID-19 At-Home Test is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 present in anterior nasal swab samples. In a prospective clinical study, the Pilot COVID-19 At-Home Test showed a relative sensitivity of 93.2% (95% CI: 81.8 to 97.7 %) and a relative specificity of 100% (95% CI: 96.7 to 100%). Overall the studies included 168 symptomatic individuals (158 evaluable samples).² This test is intended for*: 1) non-prescription home use (OTC) within the first 6 days of symptom onset, and 2) non-prescription home use, with or without symptoms or other epidemiological reasons to suspect COVID-19, when tested twice over three days with at least 24 hours (and no more than 48 hours) between tests.

*Individuals ages 14 years or older can sample and test themselves. Children ages 2 to 13 must be sampled and tested by an adult.

Variants, including omicron BA.1, BA.2 , BA.4 & BA.5, have been analyzed by SD Biosensor, and there is no expected impact on the performance of the test.4

Top Stock Reports for Berkshire Hathaway, Roche and Thermo Fisher

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Roche Holding AG and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Shares of Berkshire Hathaway have modestly outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past six months (+9.9% vs. +9.0%). The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies measured by premium volume. Berkshire's inorganic growth story remains impressive with strategic acquisitions. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and indicates the financial flexibility.



Continued insurance business growth fuels increase in float, drive earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses are delivering improved results with increased revenues over the past few years. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.



However, exposure to catastrophe loss induces earnings volatility and also affects the property and casualty underwriting results of Berkshire. Huge capital expenditure remains a headwind for the company.

Shares of Roche have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-29.4% vs. +2.4%). The company’s performance has been average of late as the demand for COVID-19 products declined significantly, even though the diagnostics base business and newer drugs, namely Hemlibra (hemophilia), Ocrevus (multiple sclerosis), Evrysdi (spinal muscular atrophy) and Tecentriq (cancer), maintained momentum.



Sales of Actemra/RoActemra and Ronapreve (COVID-19) are declining with the pandemic weakening in several countries since last year. However, 2023 is also expected to be a challenging year for the company due to the expected sharp decline in sales of COVID-19 products of roughly CHF 5 billion.

Story continues

Nevertheless, the uptake of the new eye drug, Vabysmo, was outstanding. The Diagnostics business also remained stable in terms of the growth of its routine business.



(You can read the full research report on Roche here >>>)



Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific have gained +7.8% over the past six months against the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry’s gain of +12.7%. The company’s robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising.



During the fourth quarter, the company opened a new bioanalytical lab in Richmond, VA, to support its clinical research business. The integration of PPD is largely complete and drove strong returns for the shareholders with outstanding execution and business performance throughout the year.



However, revenues within Europe declined in the low teens. The same in Asia Pacific fell in the mid-single digits, while China registered a decline in the mid-single digits. Revenues in the rest of the world declined in high-single digits.

ZURICH, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Roche (ROG.S) has launched a new PCR test to detect a fast-spreading sub-variant of the Omicron variant of Coronavirus, the Swiss drugmaker said on Thursday.

The new test specifically targets the XBB.1.5 Omicron variant and will help researchers closely track the virus’s lineage and provide insights into the epidemiology and impact it has on public health, the company added.

The XBB.1.5 variant is prevalent in the United States and is quickly spreading to other countries, Roche said.

""Being able to differentiate emerging variants and understand their similarities and mutations provides a basis for experts to make predictions about their spread and respond with appropriate treatment strategies,"" Roche said.

Roche is dropping its investigational AKT inhibitor ipatasertib, which was being assessed in a Phase III trial for castration-resistant prostate cancer, the company revealed Thursday in its 2022 full-year financial report.

Aside from ipatasertib, Roche is also punting its early-stage candidate efmarodocokin alfa, which was in a Phase I trial for acute graft-versus-host disease, zinpentraxin alfa, a candidate for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and its Alzheimer’s hopeful, gantenerumab.

The company had previously announced it was discontinuing gantenerumab after the drug failed two Phase III studies.

Ipatasertib is an orally administered small molecule inhibitor of three isoforms of the AKT protein, which in turn cripples a crucial signaling cascade in cancer cell growth and proliferation.

Roche has had a difficult time trying to get ipatasertib through the clinic. In June 2020, its subsidiary, Genentech, reported the candidate hit only one of two co-primary endpoints in the Phase III IPATential150 trial in metastatic CRPC.

Ipatasertib suffered another late-stage defeat in February 2021, when the company announced it was terminating the Phase III IPATunity130 study in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. The candidate fell short of both efficacy endpoints in that study.

Roche brought zinpentraxin alfa into its fold in 2019 when it offered $1.4 billion to acquire fibrosis player Promedior. The candidate is a recombinant form of human pentraxin-2 and is being investigated as a novel anti-fibrotic immunomodulator. The candidate still has an ongoing Phase II trial in myelofibrosis.

Meanwhile, efmarodocokin alfa is a recombinant human fusion protein that targets IL-22 to treat inflammatory diseases. Roche had previously discontinued a Phase II study where the candidate was being investigated as a potential treatment for COVID-19-related pneumonia.

A Busy Year Ahead

Despite terminating two programs, Roche is looking forward to several late-stage and regulatory milestones this year.

Its Vabysmo (faricimab-svoa), for example, is awaiting U.S. approval for retinal vein occlusion, as is the subcutaneous route of Tecentriq (atezolizumab) administration.

Roche’s investigational bispecific monoclonal antibody glofitamab is also slated for U.S. approval as third-line treatment in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, while Polivy (polatuzumabvedotin-piiq), in combination with chemotherapy, is awaiting regulatory verdict as first-line therapy in this indication.

As for pivotal readouts, Roche is awaiting data from four Phase III studies for Tecentriq, either as a monotherapy or in combination with standard chemotherapy or biologic treatments. Venclexta (venetoclax tablets), its lymphoma drug, is also set to wrap up two Phase III studies, one in multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome.

Other drugs with upcoming Phase III readouts include Susvimo(ranibizumab injection) for diabetic retinopathy, Xolair (omalizumab) for food allergy and Alecensa (alectinib) for non-small cell lung cancer.

Roche is also entering six new molecular entities into Phase I studies, including for retinal disease, cystic fibrosis and solid tumors.",[],

The company’s performance has been average of late as the demand for COVID-19 products declined significantly, even though the diagnostics base business and newer drugs, namely Hemlibra (hemophilia), Ocrevus (multiple sclerosis), Evrysdi (spinal muscular atrophy) and Tecentriq (cancer), maintained momentum.



Sales of Actemra/RoActemra and Ronapreve (COVID-19) are declining with the pandemic weakening in several countries since last year. However, 2023 is also expected to be a challenging year for the company due to the expected sharp decline in sales of COVID-19 products of roughly CHF 5 billion.

Story continues

Nevertheless, the uptake of the new eye drug, Vabysmo, was outstanding. The Diagnostics business also remained stable in terms of the growth of its routine business.

Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific have gained +7.8% over the past six months against the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry’s gain of +12.7%. The company’s robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising.



During the fourth quarter, the company opened a new bioanalytical lab in Richmond, VA, to support its clinical research business. The integration of PPD is largely complete and drove strong returns for the shareholders with outstanding execution and business performance throughout the year.



However, revenues within Europe declined in the low teens. The same in Asia Pacific fell in the mid-single digits, while China registered a decline in the mid-single digits. Revenues in the rest of the world declined in high-single digits.

Roche warned of a decline in 2023 earnings, as revenue growth from new drugs including haemophilia treatment Hemlibra and multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus would not make up for a steep demand drop for Covid treatments and diagnostic testing. Sales and core earnings per share were expected to decrease at a ""low single-digit"" percentage this year, the Swiss drugmaker said in a statement on Thursday. related investing news Piper Sandler says this biotech stock can outperform thanks to Alzheimer's treatment Last year, group revenue edged 1% higher to 63.3 billion Swiss francs ($69.78 billion), the company reported, beating market expectations of 63.2 billion francs, while core operating profit gained 1% to 22.2 billion Swiss francs, just shy of the average analyst estimate of 22.4 billion francs. Roche CEO Severin Schwan told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore that the company had expected last year's decline and anticipated a further sharp drop-off in Covid-related sales, as the pandemic becomes endemic. The decline will equate to 5 billion Swiss francs, in his estimate.

Schwan, who is preparing to leave the chief executive job next month to become Roche chair, added that the company was seeing ""good momentum"" with newer medicines. Addressing a drop in sales in some of its big legacy franchises, with increased competition in biosimilars, he said: ""Growth is now really driven, on the one hand still by cancer medicines, but also importantly by new medicines in other therapeutic areas."" He referenced drugs in ophthalmology and for hemophilia and multiple sclerosis. ""When it comes to overall healthcare systems, I truly believe that those innovations will not only help to avoid a lot of suffering of patients but actually those innovations will help us manage the cost of the overall system, because we avoid a lot of follow-on costs.""

Under the terms of the agreement, the termination will be effective 12 months from the notification date of February 22, 2023. During the transition period, Blueprint Medicines and Roche are mutually committed to ensuring a smooth transition process with no anticipated interruptions or changes to patient access. In addition, the company will explore options to advance and simplify the continued global commercialization and development of GAVRETO.

""At Blueprint Medicines, we are dedicated to driving innovation and changing outcomes for patients with lung cancer. GAVRETO is an important treatment option for patients with RET fusion-positive lung cancer and other RET-altered cancers, and we are committed to ensuring that patients being treated with GAVRETO in the commercial and clinical trial settings continue to have access,"" said Kate Haviland, Chief Executive Officer of Blueprint Medicines. ""Over the next year, we will work alongside Roche to transition the GAVRETO program. In parallel, Blueprint will determine the optimal path forward to bring GAVRETO to patients in a way that maximizes its impact and value. As we do this, we will remain focused on our 2023 goals, with our highest priorities being the anticipated U.S. launch of AYVAKIT® (avapritinib) in indolent systemic mastocytosis and the ongoing advancement of our pipeline of investigational medicines.""

Since the initiation of the collaboration with Roche in July 2020, Blueprint Medicines has benefited from approximately $1 billion between upfront and milestone payments and from cost-sharing the commercialization and development of GAVRETO. The company anticipates no impact to its 2023 revenue guidance, which includes $40 million to $50 million in collaboration revenues from existing collaborations, or its anticipated operating expenses in 2023. In addition, the company continues to expect that its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, together with anticipated future product revenues, will provide sufficient capital to enable the company to achieve a self-sustainable financial profile.

About GAVRETO (pralsetinib)

GAVRETO (pralsetinib) is a once-daily oral targeted therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of three indications: adult patients with metastatic RET fusion-positive NSCLC as detected by an FDA approved test, adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with advanced or metastatic RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) who require systemic therapy, and adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory (if radioactive iodine is appropriate).

https://fsspx.news/en/news-events/news/rome-cardinal-roche-sends-letter-warning-german-bishops-81549,Rome: Cardinal Roche Sends a Letter of Warning to the German Bishops,"The Prefect of the Dicastery for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, Cardinal Arthur Roche addressed a seven-page letter to Bishop Georg Bätzing, President of the German Episcopal Conference (DBK), on Wednesday, March 29, 2023, to warn German bishops.

The katholisch.de site obtained a copy of this letter. The purpose of the letter is to warn the DBK against practices incompatible with the doctrine of the Church or current canon law, practices approved by the last Assembly of the Synodal Path at the beginning of March.

Laity Preaching During the Mass

The Prefect of the Dicastery for Divine Worship refers to the liturgical law in force, which only authorizes clerics to preach at Mass. “It is not a question of an exclusion of the laity nor of a negation of the right and the duty of all baptized people to announce the Gospel, but rather of a confirmation of the specificity of this form of preaching which is homily,” he said.

It is not a question of creating inequalities between the baptized, but of recognizing “that there are distinctions made by the Spirit, which engender different, distinct and complementary charisms,” continues the letter. By virtue of the sacrament of orders, the ordained minister is responsible for the proclamation of the Word as well as for the consecration.

“The Word and the sacrament are inseparable realities and, insofar as they are not only the formal expression of the exercise of the 'sacra potestas' [sacred power], they are not separable and cannot be delegated,” he concludes.

Cardinal Roche suggests that the skills acquired by the laity be used for catechism and other forms of preaching outside the liturgical celebration.

The Administration of Baptism by the Laity

A text voted at the last Assembly of the Synodal Path, on Friday March 11, requires from the German bishops an authorization in principle concerning “the introduction of the extraordinary administration of baptism according to can. 230 §3 CIC 1983.” In other words, to allow in an ordinary way what is the object of extraordinary cases.

Cardinal Roche refers to the law in force which provides for baptism by lay people only in the event of the absence or impediment of a cleric. This condition is met when a minister cannot be contacted within one month. Such circumstances “do not seem to exist in any diocese within the domain of the German Episcopal Conference,” he adds.

The “Ecumenical Rite” of Baptism Is Invalidated

In his letter, Archbishop Roche indicates that the ecumenical rite of baptism for children of families of different confessions, published in 2021 by certain German dioceses and certain regional Protestant churches, has not been approved and therefore cannot be used.

Finally, Cardinal Roche recalls the rules on the translation of liturgical texts, which must be “faithful and appropriate” and transmitted to the Holy See for “recognition” or approval.

Reactions in Germany

On behalf of the episcopal conference, a spokesperson said Thursday that dialogue with Rome would continue to be sought, as the letter itself suggested.

The press secretary of the Central Committee of German Catholics (ZdK) said the committee welcomed the letter from Rome. But she explains that the practice of the German Church is already more advanced than the current teaching of the Church on baptism and preaching: “In a few years, no one will be able to seriously oppose it.”

The homily by lay people has at least been tolerated for years in some dioceses. In the diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart, this has existed since 1999 under the impulse of the then bishop, Walter Kasper. At the end of 2022, the current bishop of Rottenburg, Gebhard Fürst, put into effect a decree allowing lay theologians to administer baptism.

In the spring, the diocese of Essen had already commissioned the first pastoral and community agents to administer baptism. In the Swiss diocese of Basel, lay people have been baptizing for years, and since 2019 also in parishes that are not run by lay people. The list is not exhaustive.

Conclusion

Cardinal Roche’s intervention is certainly welcome, clear, and well-argued. But the question that must be asked is the following: how far will he go to bring the German bishops back into line? The first reactions leave no doubt about the will of the bishops and the faithful of Germany to implement the decisions of their Synodal Path.

It will be much more difficult to make them fall into line than to strike with redoubled blows on the priests and the faithful who use the traditional rite. Until now, none of the Roman interventions, since the beginning of the Synodal Path, has had any effect, whether it comes from the Pope or from the Curia, with the exception of a modification of the Statutes.

The results of this action will be a touchstone of the real strength of the Curia, and of the Prefect of the Dicastery for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments in particular, in the face of the German Episcopate.",[],2023-04-06 20:41:05+02:00

amounts to CHF 13.5 billion (-6%; -9% in CHF) Board proposes dividend increase to CHF 9.50. If approved by shareholders, this would be the 36th consecutive dividend increase.





Outlook for 2023

Due to the sharp decline in sales of COVID-19 products of roughly CHF 5 billion, Roche expects a decrease in Group sales in the low single digit range (at constant exchange rates). Excluding this COVID-19 sales decline, Roche anticipates solid underlying sales growth in both divisions.

Core earnings per share are targeted to develop broadly in line with sales decline (at constant exchange rates). Roche expects to further increase its dividend in Swiss francs.

Roche CEO Severin Schwan: “We achieved good results in 2022, even though the demand for COVID-19 products declined, as expected. The diagnostics base business and our newer medicines continued their strong growth. While we had pipeline setbacks in 2022, I am particularly pleased that we brought two new medicines to patients: Vabysmo for certain severe eye diseases and Lunsumio for a currently incurable form of blood cancer. For the current year we expect solid underlying growth in both divisions, which will largely compensate for the further significant drop in sales of roughly CHF 5 billion in COVID-19 products.”

Group results

In 2022, Roche achieved sales growth of 2% (+1% in CHF) to CHF 63.3 billion.

Core operating profit increased by 3% (+1% in CHF), reflecting the good underlying business performance.

IFRS net income was CHF 13.5 billion, a decrease of 6% compared to the previous year. This was due to higher impairment of intangible assets and higher interest costs and income taxes.

Core earnings per share increased by 5% (+2% in CHF). This includes the positive impact of the repurchase of Roche shares held by Novartis.

Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division increased by 2% to CHF 45.6 billion. Newer medicines to treat severe diseases continued their strong growth. Vabysmo, an eye medicine launched at the beginning of 2022, is already one of the top five growth drivers. This medicine, together with Ocrevus (multiple sclerosis), Hemlibra (haemophilia), Evrysdi (spinal muscular atrophy) and Tecentriq (cancer), generated additional sales totalling CHF 3.2 billion.

Sales of COVID-19 medicines were generally lower (with a decline of roughly CHF 0.5 billion): the drop in sales of Actemra/RoActemra (severe COVID-19 pneumonia) was only partially made up by the sales growth of Ronapreve (high-risk patients) in Japan.

As expected, the impact of biosimilars on the sales of the cancer medicines MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin continued to slow down (combined CHF 1.9 billion of sales reduction).

Sales in the United States decreased slightly (-1%). The sales growth of the newer medicines Ocrevus, Vabysmo, Hemlibra and Tecentriq partially compensated for the sales decline of Actemra/RoActemra (COVID-19) and medicines whose patents have expired.

In Europe, sales were also slightly down (-2%), mainly due to lower sales of the COVID-19 medicine Ronapreve. Excluding this base effect, sales in Europe increased by 6%, as the newer medicines more than offset the impact of biosimilars.

Sales in Japan increased by a substantial 26%. The key factors were supplies of Ronapreve to the government, followed by sales growth of Evrysdi, Polivy, Hemlibra and Enspryng. This more than offset the impact of biosimilars and government price cuts.

Sales in the International region grew by 1%. In China, sales decreased by 7% due to biosimilars, lower sales of Rocephin and local COVID-19 measures. Excluding China, sales in the region increased by 6%, mainly as a result of a higher demand for Perjeta, Hemlibra, Ocrevus and Kadcyla.

The Diagnostics Division increased its sales by 3% to CHF 17.7 billion. The division’s base business – up 7% – achieved good results over the year and across all regions. Growth was mainly driven by immunodiagnostic products.

Roche’s broad portfolio of COVID-19 tests generated sales totalling CHF 4.1 billion in 2022 (2021: CHF 4.7 billion).

Sales in the Asia-Pacific and North America regions increased by 23% and 13%, respectively. The 16% drop in sales in the EMEA region is primarily due to the reduced demand for COVID-19 testing.





Pharmaceuticals Division: pipeline

In 2022, Roche brought two important new medicines to patients: Vabysmo (serious eye diseases) and Lunsumio (blood cancer). Currently, Roche has a total number of 87 new compounds and 65 additional indications in clinical development or registration.

Oncology remained the primary area for research and development, with the cancer immunotherapy portfolio a key driver. Ophthalmology, neuroscience and immunology represent other significant areas of late-stage investments.





Key regulatory approvals, filings and read-outs in the fourth quarter of 2022

(incl. January 2023)

Oncology and haematology

Roche reached a number of regulatory milestones and presented new data from its leading haematology portfolio, which spans numerous blood diseases, including haemophilia A, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) and various types of blood cancers.

Data from the HAVEN 7 study reinforced the efficacy and safety of Hemlibra in infants with severe haemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors. These initial results support the benefit of starting treatment with Hemlibra at birth, as early preventive treatment in infants.

in infants with severe haemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors. These initial results support the benefit of starting treatment with Hemlibra at birth, as early preventive treatment in infants. Based on the results of the HAVEN 6 study, the CHMP recommended the expansion of the EU label for Hemlibra to include people with moderate haemophilia A. If approved, Hemlibra will offer an effective and convenient prophylactic treatment option for these people.

to include people with moderate haemophilia A. If approved, Hemlibra will offer an effective and convenient prophylactic treatment option for these people. New and updated data supported the use of Polivy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), an aggressive form of blood cancer, including its potential as a treatment option for previously untreated patients. In January 2023, China simultaneously approved two indications: Polivy for the treatment of previously untreated DLBCL, and for relapsed or refractory DLBCL.

in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), an aggressive form of blood cancer, including its potential as a treatment option for previously untreated patients. In January 2023, China simultaneously approved two indications: Polivy for the treatment of previously untreated DLBCL, and for relapsed or refractory DLBCL. Positive new data from a phase III study in China demonstrated that crovalimab is effective and well-tolerated in people with PNH. PNH is an ultra-rare and life-threatening blood condition, where red blood cells are targeted and destroyed by the complement system, a part of the immune system. Based on these data, China granted priority review for approval of crovalimab.

PNH is an ultra-rare and life-threatening blood condition, where red blood cells are targeted and destroyed by the complement system, a part of the immune system. Based on these data, China granted priority review for approval of crovalimab. The FDA approved Lunsumio to treat people with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL), a blood cancer that grows slowly, but is currently incurable. As a first-in-class T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody that can be initiated in an outpatient setting, Lunsumio with its high response rates and fixed duration could change the way advanced FL is treated.

, a potential first-in-class bispecific antibody that may improve the lives of people with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Lunsumio and glofitamab are both part of Roche’s leading programme for bispecific CD20xCD3 antibodies. Recently presented data further support the potential of these two compounds as effective, off-the-shelf, fixed-duration treatment options for people with blood cancer.





In December, the FDA approved Tecentriq as the first-ever therapy for certain advanced sarcoma (alveolar soft part sarcoma; ASPS). ASPS is a rare, insidious soft tissue sarcoma most common in younger people that is often advanced at diagnosis, can spread slowly but inexorably over decades, and often returns following surgery. For those diagnosed with advanced ASPS, only an estimated 20% will live for five years.

The FDA also accepted the Biologics License Application for the subcutaneous formulation of Tecentriq. If approved, this new formulation would be administered under the skin within minutes, compared with up to an hour for an infusion.

Today, more than 70% of people with early-stage liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC) may have their cancer return after surgery, which is associated with a poorer prognosis and shorter survival. In January, Roche reported positive results from the IMbrave050 study. It is the first phase III study to show that a cancer immunotherapy combination, Tecentriq plus Avastin, reduced the risk of a relapse in people with this type of liver cancer.

Ophthalmology

Vabysmo is the first bispecific antibody for the eye. It simultaneously targets and inhibits two signalling pathways that drive neovascular or ‘wet’ age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and diabetic macular oedema (DME) – two of the leading causes of vision loss. Launched at the beginning of 2022, the eye medicine showed a strong uptake.

In October, new encouraging data from two global phase III studies demonstrated that Vabysmo could also provide a new treatment option for people living with retinal vein occlusion (RVO). RVO is a serious retinal vascular condition that can lead to irreversible vision impairment or vision loss. The results add to the extensive evidence supporting Vabysmo’s efficacy in treating multiple types of retinal conditions.

Neuroscience

Neurological conditions are very complex to understand and treat, but over the past few years Roche has made significant progress for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). The company is investigating more than a dozen pioneering medicines for neurological disorders.

In October, Roche presented new data for Ocrevus in MS. The data showed that early treatment with Ocrevus leads to reduced disease progression and healthcare costs, and new nine-year safety data reinforced the favourable benefit-risk profile of Ocrevus. In addition, results from more than 2,000 pregnant women with MS treated with Ocrevus do not suggest an increased risk of adverse pregnancy and infant outcomes.

In November, Roche announced results from the GRADUATE I and II studies evaluating gantenerumab in people with early Alzheimer’s disease. The studies did not meet their primary endpoint of slowing clinical decline. Roche remains committed to Alzheimer’s disease, one of the most complex neurological disorders and a major public health challenge. The company is continuing to develop and deliver tests to enable early and accurate diagnosis and has a pipeline of investigational medicines for different targets, types and stages of the disease.

COVID-19

In December, the FDA approved Actemra/RoActemra for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalised adults. Actemra/RoActemra is the first FDA-approved monoclonal antibody for treating patients with severe COVID-19, providing an important option for hospitalised patients and their healthcare providers who continue to be on the frontlines treating COVID-19. Since the beginning of the pandemic, more than one million people hospitalised with COVID-19 have been treated with Actemra/RoActemra worldwide.

Diagnostics Division: key milestones in the fourth quarter of 2022

Patients admitted for acute heart failure are at high risk of readmission and death. In November, Roche shared the positive outcomes of the STRONG-HF study – which included the utilisation of our Elecsys NT-proBNP biomarker – in patients hospitalised with acute heart failure. It was the first time a cardiac-related diagnostic study was stopped early because of superior efficacy in the active arm of the study. Implementing the study’s strategy in routine clinical practice has the potential to create a paradigm shift in the management of heart failure patients. It emphasised how diagnostics solutions, embedded in a therapeutic strategy, are an integral part of improving patient care.

Globally, up to 75% of people living with Alzheimer’s disease have not been diagnosed, and those who have, often report a long and complicated process to receive a diagnosis. In December, the Elecsys AD CSF assays received FDA clearance. They will be available on the cobas fully automated analysers, offering patients broad access to high-quality testing in a timely manner.

In 2022, as with the COVID-19 pandemic, Roche demonstrated its ability to respond quickly to new public health threats. In spring, Roche was one of the first companies to develop a suite of tests to detect the mpox virus. In November, the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the cobas MPXV test for use on Roche’s fully automated, high-throughput platforms. This real-time PCR test can help individuals to get the right results quickly.

Roche’s broad COVID-19 portfolio has also been further strengthened. The cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative test is one of the first FDA-approved COVID-19 PCR tests that is to be performed on fully automated, high-throughput platforms.

Testing early for COVID-19 can help determine the proper course of treatment. In this context, Roche announced its collaboration with Pfizer to drive awareness of the importance of timely COVID-19 testing and available treatment options.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05629-6,A dense ring of the trans-Neptunian object Quaoar outside its Roche limit,"Prediction and observations

The four stellar occultations presented here were predicted using the standard procedures of the European Research Council (ERC) Lucky Star project (https://lesia.obspm.fr/lucky-star) and are publicly available. The stars positions were obtained using Gaia Early Data Release 3 form31. Quaoar’s ephemerides were derived from the numerical integration of the motion of an asteroid32 integrator, taking advantage of Quaoar’s accurate positions derived from previous occultations. For Weywot’s ephemeris, we use the GENOID algorithm (genetic orbit identification7,33) to fit an orbital model on the ten known observations of Weywot between 2006 to 2011 from the Keck observatory6 and from a stellar occultation by Weywot, observed on 4 August 2019. It is a genetics-based algorithm that relies on a meta-heuristic method to find the most appropriate (that is, minimum χ2) set of dynamic parameters. On these data, the best results are from a Keplerian model of Weywot’s motion around Quaoar.

Extended Data Table 1 provides astrometric and photometric information on the occultations and Supplementary Table 1 lists the circumstances of the observations. Ground-based stations and one space-borne instrument (the European Space Agency (ESA)/characterizing exoplanets satellite (CHEOPS) space telescope30) were mobilized.

Data analysis

The images of the occulted stars (plus the occulting object) were analysed applying standard aperture photometry procedures34, using nearby reference stars to correct for sky transparency fluctuations. Secondary events (that is, not caused by Quaoar itself) were observed on 2 September 2018, 5 June 2019, 11 June 2020 and 27 August 2021, showing the presence of a semitransparent ring around Quaoar.

Abrupt opaque edges models, including the effects of diffraction, finite band width, exposure time and the Gaia DR2 stellar diameter, were fitted to the star dis- and re-appearances behind Quaoar’s main body using the procedures in the stellar occultation reduction and analysis (SORA) package35. For the ring events, a further parameter is the apparent ring opacity \({p}^{{\prime} }\) that measures the fractional drop of stellar flux. This parameter is related to the apparent optical depth \({\tau }^{{\prime} }\) by

$${\tau }^{{\prime} }=-ln(1-{p}^{{\prime} }),$$ (2)

where ‘apparent’ refers to the quantity measured in the sky plane (ref. 11 and references therein). Knowing the ring pole orientation, these values can be converted to their values normal to the ring plane, p and τ. For cases in which the Airy scale (details in ref. 36) is larger than the width of the ring as seen in the sky plane and assuming a monolayer ring, p is given by

$$p=| \,\sin (B)| \left(\,1-\sqrt{1-{p}^{{\prime} }}\right),$$ (3)

and assuming a polylayer ring, τ is given by37

$$\tau =| \,\sin (B)| \,\frac{{\tau }^{{\prime} }}{2},$$ (4)

where B is the ring opening angle, B = 0° (respectively, B = 90°) corresponding to an edge-on (respectively, pole-on) viewing, whereas Quaoar’s ring now has B ≅ −20° (Extended Data Table 2). The integrals of p and τ over the radial width W r of the rings define the equivalent width E p = pW r and the equivalent depth A τ = τW r of the profile. The values of E p and A τ are proportional to the amount of material present in the profiles in the monolayer and polylayer cases, respectively10.

If the ring profile is not resolved (that is, drop in flux occurs across fewer than three data points), \({p}^{{\prime} }\) is not known, however, the integral E p is still measurable10. This applies in the case of the CHEOPS detections that have only one or two data points within the flux drops (Supplementary Fig. 1).

A noteworthy observational result is the large variation of W r and τ observed among detections. For instance, the 27 August 2021 occultation shows a narrow and dense ring with W r ≅ 8 km and τ ≅ 0.5. This feature was detected from three different sites, covering about 5.1° along the ring, corresponding to a local and dense ring-arc feature of at least 365 km in length. Conversely, the 5 June 2019 event shows a wider and more transparent feature (W r ≅ 300 km and τ ≅ 0.014). Meanwhile, the equivalent widths and equivalent depths vary in narrower ranges of about 0.3–1.7 and 0.3–3.8 km, respectively (Table 1 and Extended Data Table 2).

Finally, the timings for the secondary events obtained at the various stations provide their sky-plane positions, to which an elliptical model is fitted using the χ2-statistical test, with

$${\chi }^{2}=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{N}\frac{{({r}_{i}-{r}_{i}^{{\prime} })}^{2}}{{\sigma }_{i}^{2}+{\sigma }_{{\rm{model}}}^{2}},$$ (5)

where r i is the observed distance of the ith data point to the ring centre, \({r}_{i}^{{\prime} }\) is the corresponding distance of the model (the ellipse) and σ i is the uncertainty on the distance associated with the timing uncertainty of the ith data point. Finally, the σ model parameter accounts for extra uncertainties associated with our model11,35, stemming in particular from the unknown shape of Quaoar itself, resulting in model bias on its centre position. Considering we have a single chord event that we fit an area equivalent circle of radius 555 km, but Quaoar’s shape may be a Maclaurin spheroid4 with an equatorial radius of 569 km and an oblateness of 0.087, this would cause a bias in the central position typically of roughly 27 km, the value we choose for the σ model .

Here, we assume that Quaoar’s ring is circular, so that its apparent flattening \({f}^{{\prime} }\) projected in the sky plane is related to its opening angle B through

$${f}^{{\prime} }=1-\sin (B).$$ (6)

Assuming that Quaoar’s ring pole orientation has been fixed over the 2018–2021 time interval, we used equation (5) to test a range of pole orientations and ring radii. This provides the two mirror solutions given in Table 1. Both solutions yield a satisfactory fit to the data, with best-fit χ2 value per degree of freedom of \({\chi }_{{\rm{pdf}}}^{2}=0.28\) and \({\chi }_{{\rm{pdf}}}^{2}=1.02\), respectively. Solution 2 corresponds to a ring pole orientation that is consistent with Weywot’s orbital pole orientation to within 6 ± 8°, whereas solution 1 results in a difference of 43 ± 8°. Because we expect the ring and satellite to be coplanar, solution 2 is our preferred one.

In summary, Quaoar’s ring has a normal optical depth τ ranging from 0.004 to 0.77 depending on the longitude (Extended Data Tables 2 and 3). Using an impact frequency of roughly 20τ impacts per particle and per orbit38, this implies that Quaoar’s ring particles suffer between one and ten collisions per revolution, which qualifies this ring as a dense one, that is, a dynamics dominated by collisions. As the viewing geometry of the ring has changed very little between 2018 and 2021, and because of the paucity of observations, it is not possible yet to discriminate between a monolayer or a polylayer ring.

As a first approximation, we can parallel Quaoar ring with Saturn’s rings, in that case, τ ≅ 0.25 corresponds to typical surface densities of Σ ≅ 500 kg m−3 (ref. 39). Adopting a radial width of W r = 8 km for the densest part of the ring, and considering that the equivalent width of the ring remains roughly constant in longitude (Extended Data Table 2)—so that its mass per unit length is also roughly constant—we obtain a ring mass estimation of M r = 2πaΣ ≅ 1014 kg, where a ≅ 4,100 km is the ring radius. If accreted into a single satellite with bulk density of 400 kg m−3, typical of the small inner saturnian satellites21, this would yield a body with a radius of the order of 5 km.

Multi-band profiles of the ring from the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC)

The 5 June 2019 event was monitored at the 10.4-m GTC with the HiPERCAM instrument, using a four-band system with g s (0.40–0.55 μm), r s (0.550-0.69 μm), i s (0.69–0.82 μm) and z s (0.82–1.00 μm) filters40. HiPERCAM also recorded the event in the u s -band (0.3–0.4 μm), but the occulted star could not be detected at these wavelengths. Extended Data Fig. 1 shows the light curves obtained in each band, normalized between the unocculted and the zero stellar fluxes, respectively.

As expected, the noise decreases as the wavelength increases because the occulted star is brighter in the red. We fitted the ring parameters for each filter individually (Table 1 and Extended Data Table 2). Even though we are fitting a ring detection with uniform opacity, we note that substructures may exist in some GTC profiles and thus may affect the obtained parameters, although any difference should be within the uncertainty of the parameters. No significant differences between the bands are observed in the parameters at the 3σ confidence level. Also, χ2-tests were performed to compare pairs of observations around the ring detections. The largest difference showed a P value of 0.021, meaning that there is a small 2.1% chance that the light curve obtained with the r s (or z s ) filter is different from the g s filter. All the remaining possibilities had a P value smaller than 0.2%.

The absence of wavelength dependence indicates that Quaoar’s ring contains a substantial population of particles larger than around 10 μm (refs. 12,13,14), which is in line with the dense and narrow rings of Saturn, Uranus and Chariklo.

Search for material in other light curves

No light curves besides those described above show significant drops at the times expected from the ring geometry. This essentially stems from the lack of photometric sensitivity and/or temporal resolution of these data. We derived the detection limits provided by these data sets by calculating the standard deviation of the equivalent width

$${E}_{p}(i)=\frac{| \sin (B)| }{2}[1-\varphi (i)]\Delta r(i),$$ (7)

where ϕ(i) is the observed flux and Δr(i) is the radial interval covered by each exposure in the ring plane36.

The limits of detection were evaluated using the data at their original spatial resolutions, and also after a resampling over 300 km windows, which corresponds to the widest ring profile in this project. When applied, resampling allows for increased sensitivity to small variations caused by large, diffuse structures. This procedure consists of applying a Savitsk–Golay digital filter on curves of equivalent width as a function of radial distance in the plane of the ring.

For example, W. Hanna’s data set (27 August 2021) from Yazz had a closest distance approach to Quaoar’s centre of 1,690 km counted in the ring plane and covered a region about 20,000 km before the event, up to 16,000 km after it. Secondary events were not detected up to a 3σ level of E p = 166 m per data point, with an opaque ring (p = 1) with radial width of roughly 165 m, a semitransparent ring with W r = 2.7 km and p = 0.06 or any other intermediate solutions. However, a wider and more transparent (p ⩽ 0.01) feature similar to what was observed with the GTC would be lost in the noise. All the obtained upper limits values can be found in Extended Data Table 3.

Besides the four events used here, we also revisited ten other Quaoar occultations observed since 2011 (ref. 41) to search for secondary events. None of them provided data with sufficient quality to detect the ring.

N-body simulations of accretion

We use numerical simulations with the local method in which a comoving ring patch of size 160 × 160 particle radii with periodic boundary conditions is followed to assess the accretion of particles for the proposed Quaoar ring. The particle impacts are calculated with a soft-particle method42. The number of particles is n = 2,000 in simulations with τ = 0.25 and n = 8,000 when τ = 1; here, τ stands for the dynamical optical depth defined as the total cross section of particles divided by the area of the simulated region. Such values of n are sufficient as we are only interested in the onset of accretion, not the subsequent growth or mutual evolution of the aggregates, The advantage of a small n is that we can use a direct particle–particle method for calculation of self-gravity, to ensure that short-range binary interactions are accurately modelled. Typically, simulations lasted for 50–500 orbital periods (corresponding to time scales of a few years).

Several simulations were performed, varying the bulk density of particles ρ, and for a range of elasticity models (below). We used Quaoar’s mass M Q and ring radius a given in Table 1. Identical particles with a radius R = 1 m were assumed in most of our runs. The dimensionless r H parameter characterizes the strength of self-gravity against the tidal force of the planet. It is defined as the ratio of the mutual Hill-radius (R Hill ) of a pair of particles to the sum of their physical radii,

$${r}_{{\rm{H}}}(\mu )=\frac{{R}_{{\rm{Hill}}}}{{R}_{1}+{R}_{2}}$$ (8)

where \(\mu ={M}_{1}/{M}_{2}={({R}_{1}/{R}_{2})}^{3}\) is the mass ratio of the particles and

$${R}_{{\rm{Hill}}}={\left(\frac{{M}_{1}+{M}_{2}}{3{M}_{{\rm{Q}}}}\right)}^{1/3}a.$$

If we consider a test particle at rest on the surface of a synchronously rotating spherical large particle (that is, μ = 0), the case r H (0) = 1 corresponds to the limiting case of a zero net attraction (tidal + self-gravity + centrifugal). Thus, in general, accretion (respectively, disruption) of the pair is expected for r H larger (respectively, smaller) than unity. In the case of equal-mass particles (μ = 1), we have

$${r}_{{\rm{H}}}=2.62{\left(\frac{{M}_{{\rm{Q}}}}{1.2\times 1{0}^{21}{\rm{kg}}}\right)}^{-1/3}{\left(\frac{\rho }{900{\rm{kg}}{{\rm{m}}}^{-3}}\right)}^{1/3}\left(\frac{a}{4,100\,{\rm{km}}}\right),$$

where r H (1) is denoted by r H for simplicity. In the initial state of the simulation the radial velocity dispersion c exceeds by a large factor its steady-state value and also the two-body escape velocity,

$${v}_{{\rm{esc}}}=\sqrt{2GM/R}\approx 0.07{\left(\frac{\rho }{900{\rm{kg}}{{\rm{m}}}^{-3}}\right)}^{1/2}\left(\frac{R}{1\,{\rm{m}}}\right)\,{\rm{cm}}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}.$$ (9)

During the simulation, c gradually decreases from its initial value due to collisional dissipation, until a steady-state value c st is reached, when the dissipation and viscous gain balance each other, or until c drops to about 2v esc , in which case the particles start to accrete and rapidly coalesce into a single aggregate (Extended Data Fig. 3). This transition from non-accreting to accreting behaviour is very sharp when ρ is increased. In case of accretion, we record the value of c at the onset of aggregate growth, in practice at the instant when the impact frequency had sharply increased twofold compared to its average value. Usually, the aggregate becomes visually evident within one orbital period from this instant of time.

Elasticity models

Extended Data Fig. 4 shows the ϵ(v n ) models used in our simulations. It also shows the theoretical relation between optical depth τ and the critical ϵ cr required for a balance between dissipation and viscous gain of energy43. The c st depends on the ϵ(v n ) model through the ϵ cr (τ) relation and is independent of R as long as systems with c st ≫ Rn are considered.

The specific values used in simulations, τ = 0.25 and τ = 1.0, are highlighted and the corresponding values of ϵ cr (τ) are marked on the left-hand plot. The small downward arrows for model 4 illustrate the expected drop in the average steady-state v n (proportional to c st ) when optical depth increases: basically, this drop follows from less effective viscous gain at large τ due the reduction of mean free path between impacts. Similarly, for a fixed τ, the models 3, 2 and 1 indicate successively smaller average v n s and c st (refs. 44,45).

Accretion in simulations

The classical Roche limit applies for tidal disruption of a fluid satellite when brought gradually closer to the central body. It can be written in the form of Roche critical density for a given distance (equation (1)), where γ = 0.849, as in the original analysis by Roche46. However, besides a and ρ, the accretion of ring particles also depends on c, and thereby on the elasticity of particles.

Previous local N-body simulations26 explored the onset of particle accretion in Saturn’s rings, using both constant ϵ and the ϵ(v n ) relationship of model 1 (ref. 25). The dependence on distance and bulk density was parameterized with the r H parameter (equation (8)). These simulations showed that r H > 1.1 − 1.2 leads to accretion: the upper value is for identical frictionless particles such as in the current experiments, whereas the lower value includes simulations with friction and/or particle size distribution. Note that the above condition for accretion is more stringent than the tidal destruction limit γ = 1.6 usually adopted (ref. 20), which corresponds to r H > 0.87. However, it is close to the classical value γ = 0.849, which corresponds to r H > 1.07.

All simulations of ref. 26 were limited to elasticity models (constant ϵ ≤ 0.5 or the relationship ϵ(v n ) of model 1), which correspond to fairly inelastic particles. In this case, the balance between dissipation and viscous gain leads to small velocity dispersion for all ring optical depths. In particular, the velocity dispersion maintained by impacts alone is between roughly 2Rn and 3Rn (where n is the mean motion) and is of the same order as the two-body escape velocity.

However, these highly dissipative models were compared in ref. 45 to affect models with more elastic particles, and corresponding to our model 4 (based on Fig. 22 in ref. 8). In this case, no accretion was possible even with r H = 1.23, which was the largest value explored. This stems from the high velocity dispersion that now exceeds the two-body escape velocity by a large margin.

The simulations presented here extend these studies to larger r H . The behaviour in N-body simulations is also consistent with three-body integrations24 that indicate that the probability of sticking in binary impacts increases rapidly when r H ≳ 1.2. The three-body integrations (fig. 14.18 in ref. 44) also indicate that for large r H , the accretion probability goes rapidly down when impact velocities exceed two-body escape velocity, in agreement with our current N-body experiments.

The dynamical environment of Quaoar’s ring

Table 1 lists the orbital radii of the 1/3 SOR with Quaoar and the 6/1 MMR with Weywot, assuming Keplerian motion around a spherical Quaoar of mass M Q . The error bars on the resonance locations are dominated by the uncertainty on M Q . Accounting for a possible large oblateness of Quaoar would shift these locations by only a few kilometres, leaving our conclusions unchanged. Moreover, Quaoar’s rotational light curves yield two possible rotation periods29. The short rotation period (8.8394 ± 0.0002 h) would correspond to a single-peaked light curve, which would be caused by an oblate body with albedo features on its surface. However, we know that Quaoar cannot be an oblate spheroid but a triaxial ellipsoid due to the varying projected shape of the main body that we have determined in several stellar occultations by Quaoar (whose analysis is beyond the scope of this paper). Because triaxial ellipsoids give rise to double-peaked light curves, the preferred rotation period is 17.6788 ± 0.0004 h. Besides, this double-peaked solution provided a better fit to the photometric data29.

The first-order (in the particle orbital eccentricity) SOR resonances—also called Lindblad resonances—exert torques that clear over short time scales (a few Myr) the region straddling the corotation region near 2,020 km, where the orbital period of the particles matches the rotation period of the body9. This clearing proceeds up to the outermost 1/2 Lindblad resonance near 3,200 km. Moving outwards the next resonance is the second-order 1/3 SOR, that occurs at a semimajor axis of a 1/3 = 4,197 ± 58 km. This matches within the error bars with the two possible solutions for the ring orbital radius a R1 = 4,097.3 ± 9.5 km and a R2 = 4,148.4 ± 7.4 km, at the 1.7 and 0.9σ levels, respectively. Similarly, the 6/1 Weywot MMR is at a 6/1 = 4,021 ± 57 km, again matching the two solutions a R1 and a R2 , at the 1.2 and 2.1σ levels, respectively.

We note that the two ring systems discovered around Chariklo and Haumea orbit also near the 1/3 SOR with their central bodies. For Chariklo, a 1/3 = 408 ± 20 km (ref. 47), whereas its two rings orbit at 386 and 400 km from the body11. Similarly, for Haumea we have a 1/3 = 2,285 ± 8 km, whereas the ring orbits at \(2,28{7}_{-45}^{+75}\) km (ref. 3).

Using equation (1) and ρ = 400 kg m−3, typical of the small inner saturnian satellites21, we obtain a Quaoar’s Roche limit near 1,780 km. Finally, the Quaoar corotation (or synchronous) orbit is at 2,018 ± 28 km. Extended Data Fig. 2 summarizes the various radii of interest mentioned here.

We now consider resonances between a massless ring particle and either a Quaoar’s mass anomaly or Weywot. For simplicity, Quaoar’s mass anomaly is described as a hemispheric mountain at the surface of the body (main text), however, it may also be an internal feature within an otherwise oblate, smooth body. We denote a, e, λ, ϖ, n and \(\kappa =n-{\mathop{\varpi }\limits^{^\circ }}^{{\prime} }\) the semimajor axis, orbital eccentricity, mean longitude, longitude of pericentre, mean motion and epicyclic frequency of the particle, respectively. Depending on the case, \({\lambda }^{{\prime} }\) is the orientation of Quaoar’s mass anomaly or Weywot’s mean longitude, whereas \({n}^{{\prime} }\) is either Quaoar’s spin rate or Weywot’s mean motion. In the case of Weywot, the orbital eccentricity and the longitude of pericentre of the satellite, \({e}^{{\prime} }\) and \({\varpi }^{{\prime} }\), must also be accounted for (contrarily to the mass anomaly, as the latter moves along a circle). Then \({\kappa }^{{\prime} }={n}^{{\prime} }-{\mathop{\varpi }\limits^{^\circ }}^{{\prime} }\) is Weywot’s epicyclic frequency. The quantities a 0 and n 0 are the radius and the mean motion at exact resonance. Finally, Quaoar’s and Weywot’s mass anomaly are denoted by μ Q and μ W , respectively, both normalized to Quaoar’s mass.

We consider the resonance condition \({n}_{0}/{n}^{{\prime} }=m/(m-j)\), where m is a positive or negative integer and j is positive. This resonance splits into j + 1 resonances, each described by a Hamiltonian of the form

$${\mathcal{H}}(X,Y;\Delta J)=-\frac{3}{2}{n}_{0}{\left[\Delta J-\left(\frac{m-k}{2k}\right)\left({X}^{2}+{Y}^{2}\right)\right]}^{2}+{{\epsilon }}_{k}{n}_{0}{e}^{k}{e}^{{\prime} j-k}\cos ({\psi }_{k}),$$ (10)

where \({\psi }_{k}=m{\lambda }^{{\prime} }-(m-j)\lambda -k\varpi -(j-k){\varpi }^{{\prime} }\), and where k = 0,...j is the order of the resonance in the particle’s eccentricity. The case k = 0 corresponds to a corotation-type resonance with critical angle \({\varphi }_{0}={\psi }_{0}=m{\lambda }^{{\prime} }-(m-j)\lambda -j{\varpi }^{{\prime} }\), whereas the cases k ≠ 0 correspond to eccentricity-type resonances with critical angles ϕ k = ψ k /k.

Each value of k is in fact associated with a MMR \({n}_{0}/{n}^{{\prime} }=(m-j+k)/(m-j)\) of the order k between the particle and a potential moving at the pattern speed

$${\varOmega }_{k}={n}^{{\prime} }+\frac{j-k}{m-j+k}{\kappa }^{{\prime} }.$$

For k ≠ 0, we define the eccentricity vector as \((X,Y)=[e\cos ({\varphi }_{k})\), \(e\cos ({\varphi }_{k})]\) where e2 = X2 + Y2. The Hamiltonian \({\mathcal{H}}\) is parameterized by the Jacobi constant

$$\Delta J=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\Delta a}{{a}_{0}}+\frac{m-k}{k}{e}^{2}\right),$$

where Δa = a − a 0 is the distance to the resonance. Particles with the same value of ΔJ but different initial conditions for (X, Y) follow level curves of \({\mathcal{H}}\) under the Hamiltonian flow \(\mathop{X}\limits^{^\circ }=-\partial {\mathcal{H}}/\partial Y\) and \(\mathop{Y}\limits^{^\circ }=+\partial {\mathcal{H}}/\partial X\), eventually forming the phase portrait of the resonance.

The resonant forcing is encapsulated in the perturbing term containing ϵ k in the right-hand side of equation (10), not to be confused with the coefficient of restitution ϵ used in the main text and in the section N-body simulations of accretion. It is proportional to μ Q or μ W , and its numerical values is derived from expansion of the disturbing potential of the mass anomaly48 or the satellite49.

The 1/3 SOR

The 1/3 SOR resonance corresponds to m = −1 and j = 2 in equation (10), so that n/Ω = 1/3, where the pattern speed Ω is Quaoar’s spin rate. Because the mass anomaly moves on a circle, only the resonance k = j (equal to 2 here) is allowed, so that

$${\mathcal{H}}(X,Y;\Delta J)=-\frac{3}{2}{n}_{0}{\left[\Delta J+\frac{3}{4}\left({X}^{2}+{Y}^{2}\right)\right]}^{2}+{{\epsilon }}_{1/3}{n}_{0}\left({X}^{2}-{Y}^{2}\right),$$

where the subscript 1/3 refers to the 1/3 SOR, and where we have omitted, for brevity, the index k = 2 that should appear for the coefficient ϵ. Similarly, the resonant angle is denoted \({\varphi }_{1/3}=(-{\lambda }^{{\prime} }+3\lambda -2\varpi )/2\), and ΔJ = (Δa/a 1/3 − (3/2)e2)/2. From the expression of \({\mathcal{H}}(X,Y;\Delta J)\), it results that for an interval of ΔJ of width 8∣ϵ 1/3 ∣/9 centred on the resonance, the origin (X, Y) = (0, 0) of the phase portrait is a fixed hyperbolic (and thus unstable) point. Collisions tend to damp the eccentricities, that is, force the particles to move towards the origin of the phase portrait (that is, on circular orbits). Conversely, in the interval mentioned above, the resonance tends to force them to follow eight-shaped trajectories, and thus, to acquire non-zero eccentricities. From the expression of ΔJ, this happens for a interval of semimajor axes of width W = (16∣ϵ 1/3 ∣/9)a 1/3 centred on the resonance value a 1/3 .

The forced eccentricity then reaches a peak value (Extended Data Fig. 6) of

$${e}_{{\rm{peak}},1/3}=\frac{8}{3}\sqrt{\frac{| \,{{\epsilon }}_{1/3}\,| }{3}}=0.118\sqrt{{\mu }_{{\rm{Q}}}}=0.0834{\left(\frac{h}{{R}_{{\rm{Q}}}}\right)}^{3/2}$$ (11)

at a = a 1/3 (1 − (8/9)ϵ 1/3 ), where we have used the expression of ϵ 1/3 in Extended Data Table 4. In the second equation, we have assumed that the mass anomaly takes the form of a hemispheric mountain of height h at Quaoar’s surface (main text).

The peak eccentricity e peak,1/3 tends to maintain a velocity dispersion Δv among the particles or putative parent bodies of Quaoar’s ring (main text). If the motions of these bodies are not coherent, we have

$$\Delta v=2{e}_{{\rm{peak}},1/3}{v}_{{\rm{orb}}},$$ (12)

where \({v}_{{\rm{orb}}}=\sqrt{G{M}_{{\rm{Q}}}/{a}_{1/3}}\) is the orbital velocity at the resonance. The escape velocity at the surface of a particle with radius R p and density ρ is \({v}_{{\rm{esc}}}=\sqrt{8\pi G\rho {R}_{{\rm{p}}}/3}\). Consequently, the velocity dispersion Δv is comparable to v esc for

$${\mu }_{{\rm{Q}}}\approx 2\times 1{0}^{-4}{R}_{{\rm{p}},{\rm{km}}}^{2},$$ (13)

where we have used equation (11), ρ = 400 kg m−3 and the numerical values of Table 1.

In the presence of collisions, the second-order nature of the 1/3 SOR leads to mathematical difficulties. In particular, the periodic resonant streamlines intersect at one point, even for vanishing eccentricities48. This yields to a multi-valued velocity field and infinite densities, and therefore singularities in the hydrodynamical equations.

Considering the simple case of a mass anomaly in the form of a hemispheric mountain of height h on Quaoar’s surface, the mass anomaly normalized to Quaoar’s mass is \({\mu }_{{\rm{Q}}}={(h/{R}_{{\rm{Q}}})}^{3}/2\), where R Q is Quaoar’s radius. The 1/3 SOR resonance forces an eccentricity e peak,1/3 (equation (11)), which can in turn maintain locally a velocity dispersion among the putative parent bodies in Quaoar’s ring (equation (12)). This velocity dispersion is comparable to the escape velocity at the surface of the parent bodies for a certain value of μ Q (equation (13)), or equivalently, for a certain mountain height of

$${h}_{{\rm{km}}}\approx 40{R}_{{\rm{p}},{\rm{km}}}^{2/3}.$$ (14)

Assuming parent bodies with size R p ≅ 0.1 km, typical of Saturn’s F ring parent bodies, we obtain h ≅ 10 km. Thus, plausible topographic features on Quaoar are indeed able to maintain a velocity dispersion among the parent bodies that prevent them from accreting near the 1/3 SOR. This is the case a fortiori for ring particle aggregates that have much smaller sizes. This assumes, however, that the resonant responses of the bodies are not coherent. In the opposite case, the velocity dispersion in equation (12) could be largely overestimated.

Meanwhile, more realistic numerical simulations using N-body collisional codes do show that confinement of a collisional disc (without self-gravity) is observed near the 1/3 SOR with Chariklo’s27,28. This confinement is associated with angular momentum flux reversal at certain longitudes of the ring, but is not yet backed up by analytical calculations.

The Weywot 6/1 MMR

The 6/1 MMR Weywot resonance corresponds to m = 6 and j = 5 in equation (10). It splits into six resonances as k takes the values 0,...5, with the respective resonant angles listed in Extended Data Table 4. The associated resonant terms of Weywot’s disturbing potential have amplitudes of the form \({{\epsilon }}_{6/1,k}{{\rm{e}}}^{k}{e}^{{\prime} 5-k}\), where the coefficients ϵ 6/1,k are given in Extended Data Table 4.

Corotation resonance

The case k = 0 corresponds to the corotation resonance condition \(n={n}^{{\prime} }+5{\kappa }^{{\prime} }\approx 6{n}^{{\prime} }\). It creates one stable elliptic (L 4 or L 5 -type) Lagrange point and one unstable hyperbolic (L 3 -type) point. Here we consider the possibility that the accumulation of ring material around the L 4 point might explain the longitudinal variability of Quaoar’s ring. Classical calculations provide the full width of the corotation zone:

$${W}_{{\rm{COR}}}={\left(\frac{64}{3}{{\epsilon }}_{6/1,0}\right)}^{1/2}{a}_{0},$$

that corresponds to the spread in semimajor axes of the particles trapped in this corotation resonance. Using the value of ϵ 6/1,0 (Extended Data Table 4), a 0 ≅ 4,020 km (Table 1), and assuming that Quaoar and Weywot have the same bulk density, we obtain

$${W}_{{\rm{COR}}}\approx 7,100{\left(\frac{{R}_{{\rm{W}}}}{{R}_{{\rm{Q}}}}\right)}^{3/2}{e}^{{\prime} 5/2}\,{\rm{km}},$$

where R W is Weywot’s radius. Both the quantities R W and \({e}^{{\prime} }\) (Weywot’s orbital eccentricity) are poorly constrained. Assuming the same albedo for Quaoar and Weywot, we obtain R W ≅ 40 km (ref. 5), and Weywot’s orbital solution provides \({e}^{{\prime} } < 0.15\) (using the method presented in ref. 33). The equation above then yields W COR ≲ 1 km.

This is comparable to the spread in semimajor axis of Neptune’s arcs, which is much smaller than the physical width of Neptune’s ring-like arcs, about 15 km. This is classically explained by the coherent radial motion of Neptune’s arc particles forced by the nearby satellite Galatea50. This process might also apply to Quaoar’s ring, but still remains to be established. Meanwhile, we note that W COR rapidly decreases with \({e}^{{\prime} }\). For instance, for \({e}^{{\prime} }=0.01\), we obtain W COR ≅ 1 m, which appears to be too narrow for maintaining an arc structure around Quaoar, as W COR is then comparable to the expected typical particle sizes.

Lindblad resonance

The resonance with k = 1 corresponds to a Lindblad (first-order) resonance with associated disturbing potential \({{\epsilon }}_{6/1,1}{\rm{e}}{e}^{{\prime} 4}\cos ({\varphi }_{6/1,1})\). Technically, it is a 2/1 resonance of the particle with the component of Weywot’s potential that has the pattern speed \({n}^{{\prime} }+2{\kappa }^{{\prime} }\approx 3{n}^{{\prime} }\). The same exercise as for the Quaoar 1/3 SOR, but now considering a first-order resonance, shows that this resonance forces a peak eccentricity for particles that start with a circular orbit of

$${e}_{{\rm{peak}},6/1}={\left(\frac{32}{3}{{\epsilon }}_{6/1,1}{e}^{{\prime} 4}\right)}^{1/3}=2.921\left(\frac{{R}_{{\rm{W}}}}{{R}_{{\rm{Q}}}}\right){e}^{{\prime} 4/3}.$$ (15)

The value of e peak,6/1 is again poorly constrained. However, we may compare e peak,6/1 and e peak,1/3 (equation (11)) for R W = 40 km and h = 10 km. Then the two values of e peak are comparable for a Weywot’s orbital eccentricity as small as 0.005. In other words, Weywot’s is expected to force eccentricities of the ring at the 6/1 Lindblad resonance that are comparable to or larger than the eccentricities forced by Quaoar’s 1/3 SOR.

Other resonances

The cases k = 2,...5 correspond to four further resonances of orders k in the particle eccentricities. At this stage, it is difficult to assess their interactions and effects on the corotation and Lindblad resonances, and thus, on the ring behaviour. In particular, their mutual radial distances depend on the value of the apsidal precession rate \({\mathop{\varpi }\limits^{^\circ }}^{{\prime} }\), which is unknown. Moreover, their couplings also depend on the value of \({e}^{{\prime} }\), which is largely unconstrained.

The effect of radiation pressure

Even though Quaoar is located in a far away region compared to the giant planets, the weak gravity field of the central body allows micrometric ring particles to be strongly disturbed by the radiation pressure (R P ). To first order, this force causes no secular effect in the semimajor axis of the particles, but induces periodic oscillations in the eccentricity. In a first approximation, the maximum eccentricity e RP attained by a particle of radius R, bulk density ρ initially in a circular orbit of radius a is51

$${e}_{{\rm{RP}}}=\frac{2C}{1+{C}^{2}},\quad {\rm{with}}\quad C=\frac{9}{8}\frac{n}{{n}_{{\rm{Q}}}}\frac{{Q}_{{\rm{pr}}}{F}_{\odot }{a}^{2}}{G{M}_{{\rm{Q}}}{c}^{{\prime} }\rho R},$$ (16)

where n and n Q are the mean motion of the particle and Quaoar, respectively, \({c}^{{\prime} }\) is the speed of light, F ⊙ is the solar flux at Quaoar’s orbit and Q pr is the radiation pressure coefficient, equal to unity for an ideal material.

This equation shows that ring particles smaller than about 25 μm in radius are ejected from the system, whereas grains with radius ≲45 μm reach eccentricities large enough to collide with Quaoar. In fact, particles smaller than 0.2 cm suffer radial excursions that surpass the ring width.

These results are backed up by numerical simulations performed with a modified version of the Mercury package52 that includes the radiation pressure effects. These simulations show that 1 μm particles are ejected from the system in less than a couple of years, whereas those less than or equal to 45 μm do not survive over a few decades. These results show that Quaoar’s ring is likely to be quickly depleted of sub-centimetre grains, in agreement with the GTC multi-filter observations.","['Morgado', 'B.

BASEL (Reuters) - Roche warned on Thursday profits will decline in 2023 as falling demand for its COVID-19 therapy and diagnostics kits will knock sales by over $5 billion, the latest sign that the pharmaceutical industry's years-long pandemic boost is ebbing.

Sales and core earnings per share were expected to decrease at a ""low single-digit"" percentage this year, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and diagnostics company said in a statement.

COVID-related sales, mainly from lab testing and antibody treatment Ronapreve, are seen falling by 5 billion Swiss francs ($5.5 billion) for the full year, it said.

Revenue growth from new drugs, including its haemophilia treatment and multiple sclerosis drug, would not make up for the steep COVID drop.

But ""the underlying business is growing very strongly in the high single digits,"" said Chief Executive Severin Schwan.

The pivot away from the coronavirus pandemic, which has boosted profits of many healthcare companies over the past three years, also weighed on rival diagnostics group Siemens Healthineers, which reported a 28% drop in quarterly operating profit.

Roche's shares fell as much as 1.4% to their lowest since March 2020 as investors worried about the weaker-than-expected outlook. They were down 0.9% at .

Barclays analsyts said 2023 guidance was slightly below their forecasts, but they were encouraged by the performance of its key pharma business, including newly-launched Vabysmo, which treats a common cause of blindness in the elderly.

Last year, Roche group revenue edged 1% higher to 63.3 billion Swiss francs, the company reported, slightly beating market expectations of 63.2 billion francs, while core operating profit gained 1% to 22.2 billion Swiss francs, just shy of the average analyst estimate of 22.4 billion francs.

Analysts have said that market confidence in Roche's drug development abilities, previously among the highest in the industry, has taken a blow from trial setbacks last year in Alzheimer's disease and a cancer immunotherapy hopeful.

The stock has fallen about 11% over the past three years, lagging its main global rivals like Pfizer and AstraZeneca.

Roche has lagged rivals https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/myvmokkmmvr/roche.PNG

REINVIGORATE PIPELINE

The onus to reinvigorate the pipeline will be on chief executive officer-designate Thomas Schinecker, who was previously Roche's head of diagnostics and due to be promoted to group CEO in March. Schwan will become chairman.

In the wake of Schinecker's appointment, the head of Roche's pharmaceuticals division, Bill Anderson, decided in December to leave after 16 years with the Swiss drugmaker.

Family-controlled Roche said on Thursday that Teresa Graham, currently Head of Global Product Strategy for Roche Pharmaceuticals, would succeed Anderson.

In a media call, Schwan said the company was analysing the failed trials thoroughly, but structural changes in research and development (R&D) were not called for, despite the planned changeover in management.

Roche is not alone. Analysts were disappointed on Wednesday that GSK did not give more details on how one of the world's top drugmakers plans to find its next set of blockbuster drugs.

Roche's bestseller multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus gained a currency-adjusted 17% in sales to just over 6 billion francs during the year, while its haemophilia treatment Hemlibra jumped 27% to 3.8 billion francs, both slightly above market expectations.

Its near-term commercial performance will depend on newly launched drugs such as Evrysdi, an oral drug against muscle-wasting disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and Vabysmo.

Schwan pointed in particular to Vabysmo, with 591 million francs in its market debut year, one of Roche's best.

Ovarian Cancer Overview

Ovarian cancer refers to a group of diseases that begin in the ovaries or nearby areas of the fallopian tubes and peritoneum. It is responsible for only 3% of all cancers in women. Ovarian cancer is malignant or cancerous cells that affect ovaries tissues. Ovarian cancer is now recognized as several distinct diseases, each named after the type of cell origin: epithelial, germ cell, and stromal. The most common type of ovarian cancer is epithelial ovarian cancer. The exact ovarian cancer cause is unknown.

Ovarian cancer frequently has warning signs, but early ovarian cancer symptoms are vague and easily dismissed. The ovarian cancer symptoms are frequently subtle and easily confused with other, more common problems. Bloating, pelvic pain, frequent urination, and feeling full quickly with eating are early symptoms, while advanced symptoms include changes in bowel habits, back pain, ascites, fatigue, and others. There is no single test for ovarian cancer diagnosis; instead, physicians consider the symptoms in conjunction with the results of the patient history, physical examination, biopsies, blood tests, and imaging scans (ultrasound, CT, and MRI).

Ovarian Cancer Epidemiology Segmentation

According to DelveInsight's estimate, the total diagnosed incident cases of ovarian cancer in the 7MM comprised 58K cases in 2022 and are projected to reach up to 46K cases by 2032. These cases are anticipated to decrease during the study period.

As per the estimates, in EU4 and the UK, the highest number of total diagnosed incident cases of ovarian cancer was observed in Germany in 2022.

Ovarian Cancer Treatment Market

Currently, the most effective therapeutic agents against newly diagnosed ovarian cancer are platinum analogs, such as cisplatin or carboplatin, combined with a taxane, such as paclitaxel or docetaxel. Primary surgical cytoreduction (to debulk tumors) followed by combination platinum-based chemotherapy or chemotherapy before surgery (neoadjuvant therapy) followed by interval surgical cytoreduction and additional chemotherapy after surgery are both options for first-line newly diagnosed ovarian cancer treatment.

Women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer frequently experience recurrence after the initial platinum-based chemotherapy, and most patients have shown resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. However, recent advances in new therapeutics for recurrent ovarian cancer treatment have shown promising results. Angiogenesis inhibitors, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, and others are among the new ovarian cancer treatment options.

Given the disease's recurrence and progression, proper management and ovarian cancer treatment methods are required, which may include checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapies, and other angiogenesis inhibitors. Proper ovarian cancer treatment methods, such as pharmacological treatments and other techniques, are required to prevent the recurrence and progression of this deadly disease. With current ovarian cancer therapies and well-defined screening programs for ovarian cancer, there is still a significant unmet need. OC is often misdiagnosed until it is advanced, at which point the disease becomes extremely aggressive and easily progresses into other deadly stages.

Ovarian Cancer Market Dynamics

The dynamics of the ovarian cancer market are expected to change in the coming years owing to an increase in diagnosed cases, increased awareness about the disease, and others. Advocacy organizations such as the International Gynecologic Cancer Society (IGCS) and the World Ovarian Cancer Coalition (WOCC) have launched campaigns to raise awareness and educate women about ovarian cancer. These programs disseminate information about ovarian cancer risk factors, symptoms, recommended screening, and prevention strategies.

Moreover, the rapid advancement in R&D will cater to the lack of early-stage diagnosis; hence, more patient pools will be available for clinical studies and treatment in the ovarian cancer market. Furthermore, the ovarian cancer pipeline is very robust; many potential therapies are being investigated for the treatment of ovarian cancer, and it is safe to predict that the treatment space will significantly impact the ovarian cancer market during the forecast period. Moreover, the anticipated introduction of emerging therapies with improved efficacy and a further improvement in the diagnosis rate are expected to drive the growth of the ovarian cancer market in the 7MM.

However, several factors are impeding the growth of the ovarian cancer market. The wide use of generics as a standard of care treatment for ovarian cancer may threaten the growth of the ovarian cancer market. Moreover, ovarian cancer treatment poses a significant economic burden and disrupts patients' overall well-being and QOL. Furthermore, the ovarian cancer market growth may be offset by failures and discontinuation of emerging therapies, unaffordable pricing, market access and reimbursement issues, and a shortage of healthcare specialists. In addition, the undiagnosed, unreported cases and the unawareness about the disease may also impact the ovarian cancer market growth.

Summary Companies Trials show small benefit, but without statistical validity

Roche's setback leaves Biogen, Eisai as leaders in the field

Onus on Roche CEO-designate to revive development fortunes

Roche shares down 3.4%, development partner Morphosys down 29%















Nov 14 (Reuters) - Roche's (ROG.S) Alzheimer's drug candidate could not be shown to slow dementia progression in two drug trials, leaving rivals Biogen (BIIB.O) and Eisai (4523.T) as leaders in a high-stakes race to launch a treatment for the memory-robbing disease.

Roche said in a statement on Monday that twin studies known as Graduate 1 and 2 had not reached their main goal of showing that the drug gantenerumab could preserve abilities such as remembering, solving problems, orientation and personal care in patients suffering from early stages of Alzheimer's disease.

The Swiss drugmaker conducted two identically designed studies, each with about 1,000 participants, who were examined and queried by physicians over more than two years. Within each study, volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either the injectable antibody drug gantenerumab or a placebo.

The drug was associated with a relative reduction in clinical decline of 8% in Graduate 1 and 6% in Graduate 2 compared with the placebo, but those results were not statistically significant, the company said in a statement.

Credit Suisse analysts, who had seen a 20% chance of the drug reaching peak annual sales of $10 billion, described the trial failure as ""unequivocal"".

Berenberg analysts had put a 50% probability on gantenerumab achieving the $10 billion peak.

Roche shares fell 3.4% to their lowest in almost seven weeks.

Shares of U.S. drugmakers Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) and Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N), which are developing rival treatments for Alzheimer's, rose 3.8% and 2.3%, respectively, in premarket trading.

Analysts have said the read-out from the trial would impact stock market confidence in Roche's research prowess, especially after lung cancer immunotherapy hopeful tiragolumab fell through in trials earlier this year, battering the company's shares.

""The development pipeline has disappointed a bit too often to keep the stock on a list of favourites,"" analysts at Luzerner Kantonalbank said in a research note.

Gantenerumab was designed to bind to aggregated forms of beta-amyloid and remove brain amyloid plaques, which are believed to play a crucial role in the slowly progressing dementia disease.

The setback will be an added challenge for CEO-designate Thomas Schinecker, Roche's head of diagnostics, who will be promoted in March. He will replace Severin Schwan, the chief executive who has led a successful campaign to diversify away from Roche's traditional focus on cancer.

The quest to develop an Alzheimer's drug, targeting beta-amyloid or other molecules, has been beset by a long list of study failures.

But Biogen in September scored a surprise trial success with an experimental Alzheimer's drug that it developed with Eisai, rebuilding confidence among industry executives and researchers in the beta-amyloid approach.

Biogen and Eisai said at the time their drug candidate lecanemab had slowed progression of the brain-wasting disease by 27% compared with a placebo in a large trial of patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's.

Roche's trial failure ""takes out the biggest competitive risk to lecanemab,"" Baird analyst Brian Skorney said in a note.

The Swiss company's compound was primarily targeting larger amyloid structures while Biogen's lecanemab was targeting earlier stages of amyloid build-up, among other differences in the molecules and the trial designs.

Roche released only the main outcome of the trials on Monday. It plans to present detailed data at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease conference in San Francisco on Nov. 30.

Rachelle Doody, Roche's head of neurodegeneration, said she was very disappointed, adding that trial measures of amyloid removal were also lower than hoped.

""We will be showing that there is a relationship between the lowering of amyloid and the clinical outcomes. It's just that when you don't get the amyloid lowering that you expected you won't get the clinical outcome that you expected,"" she told Reuters.

The global Alzheimer’s Association said the read-out, though disappointing, further illustrated the relationship between removal of beta-amyloid and slowing clinical decline, but other research approaches should be considered.

""The future of Alzheimer’s treatment will be a combination of drugs that target different aspects of the disease at different times, as well as lifestyle interventions,"" it said in a statement.

DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE

Most of the 55 million people suffering from dementia worldwide are likely to be affected by Alzheimer's disease, according to the World Health Organization. In 2030, dementia is expected to affect 78 million.

Alzheimer's is difficult to diagnose, especially during its early stages.

Germany's Morphosys (MORG.DE) would have received tiered royalties of about 2% to 3% on future gantenerumab sales from its early role in developing the drug. Its shares plunged 31%.

Royalty Pharma (RPRX.O) would have been entitled to about 3% to 4% of gantenerumab sales under a 2021 deal with Morphosys.

Data from a key late-stage trial of Eli Lilly's amyloid-targeting antibody drug, donanemab, is expected by mid-2023.

https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/roche-names-new-ceo-with-schwan-set-become-chairman-2022-12-12/,Roche's head of pharmaceuticals to leave company,"













ZURICH, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Roche (ROG.S) said on Monday the head of its pharmaceuticals division had decided to leave after 16 years with the Swiss drugmaker, heralding a wider reshuffle in addition to a planned CEO changeover early next year.

Bill Anderson, the former boss of Roche's Genentech unit, would quit at the end of the year ""to pursue opportunities outside of Roche"", with a successor due to be named by March 2023, Roche said in a statement.

Anderson's departure from heading Roche's largest business means more fundamental change to manage for CEO-designate Thomas Schinecker, Roche's head of diagnostics, who is due to be promoted to group CEO in March.

He will replace CEO Severin Schwan, who has led a successful years-long campaign to diversify away from Roche's traditional focus on cancer.

But the onus will be on Schinecker to reinvigorate the development pipeline after family-controlled Roche this year ran into a string of development setbacks: A keenly-followed Alzheimer's drug trial failed last month and a new lung cancer immunotherapy candidate flopped in May.

The Swiss company's shares have dropped about 20% so far this year, a worse performance than the 5% decline in the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care (.SXDP) index.

Anderson will be replaced on a temporary basis by Schinecker, the company added.

Schinecker will replace Severin Schwan, who is slated to become chairman after 14 years as CEO of Roche.

""Over his 16-year career at Roche, Bill Anderson has demonstrated excellent leadership. He has been instrumental in shaping Roche's transformation and I wish him all the best for the future,"" Schwan said in a statement.

Anderson joined California-based Genentech in 2006 as senior vice president of the Immunology and Ophthalmology Business Unit, before leading the Bio oncology Business Unit.

He had been CEO of Roche's pharmaceuticals business since 2019.

In proposals for next year's AGM, Roche also confirmed its intention to propose Schwan as the next chairman.

As previously announced in July 2022, Christoph Franz has decided not to seek re-election as chairman, Roche said on Monday.

It added that Nestle (NESN.S) CEO Mark Schneider and Akiko Iwasaki, an Immunobiology professor at Yale University, would stand for election as new board members at next year's annual general meeting.

Roche’s stock has lost 18.7% in the past year against the industry’s growth of 9.3%.

Zacks Investment Research

The company reported total sales of CHF 16.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, up 4% year over year.

Sales in 2022 came in at CHF 63.3 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Core earnings per share totaled CHF 20.3 for the year, up from CHF 19.81 in 2021.

The company reports results under two divisions — Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at constant exchange rates.

Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division were up only 2% in 2022 at CHF 45.5 billion as lower sales of Actemra/RoActemra (severe COVID-19) dragged sales.

The Diagnostics division’s sales were up 3%, driven by ongoing strong momentum in the base business, which more than offset the continuing decline in the demand for COVID-19 tests in the second half of the year.

2022 in Detail

Sales of Ocrevus, used to treat two types of multiple sclerosis, increased 17% to CHF 6 billion as demand in both indications (relapsing and primary progressive forms of multiple sclerosis) remained strong.

Perjeta’s sales grew 5% to CHF 4.1 billion due to continued high demand in the international region, mainly in China.

Sales of Hemlibra surged 27% to CHF 3.8 billion, fueled by strong uptake in the United States, the international region and Europe.

Immuno-oncology drug, Tecentriq (for advanced lung cancer, urothelial cancer and breast cancer), recorded 14% year-over-year sales growth to CHF 3.7 billion as sales increased due to high demand in the United States and Europe.

Actemra/RoActemra recorded sales of CHF 2.7 billion, down 22% as sales decreased, mainly in the United States and international region, driven by lower demand for patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Story continues

Asthma drug Xolair raked in sales of CHF 2.2 billion, up 9%, as sales grew in the chronic spontaneous urticaria indication.

Herceptin sales were down 19% to CHF 2.1 billion due to biosimilar uptake in various countries.

Sales of Avastin, approved for multiple oncology indications, were down 28% to CHF 2.1 billion due to biosimilar competition in the United States and Europe.

Kadcyla sales were up 7% to CHF 2.1 billion, driven by the usage of Kadcyla in the early breast cancer setting.

Sales of Rituxan/MabThera (for blood cancer and rheumatoid arthritis) declined 20% to CHF 2.1 billion due to biosimilar erosion, primarily in the United States.

Ronapreve, the antibody cocktail of casirivimab and imdevimab, for the treatment of recently diagnosed high-risk patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, generated sales of CHF 1.7 billion, up 17% as sales increased due to supplies of Ronapreve to the Japanese government. Roche and partner Regeneron REGN collaborated for the development and manufacture of the cocktail.

Roche is responsible for distribution in Europe and other countries outside the United States. Regeneron is responsible for the United States.

Sales of the lung cancer drug, Alecensa, were up 15% to CHF 1.5 billion on solid growth across all regions.

The recently approved spinal muscular atrophy drug, Evrysdi, generated sales of CHF 1.1 billion on the back of strong uptake across all regions, driven by Europe and the international region.

Sales of the ophthalmology drug Lucentis declined 28% to CHF 1 billion, primarily due to competitive pressure. Lucentis started facing biosimilars as soon as the first version (with a restricted label) came to market in the United States at the beginning of the third quarter of 2022.

Phesgo, a fixed-dose combination of Perjeta and Herceptin for subcutaneous injection, sales came in at CHF 740 million, up 121%, as sales continued to show a strong uptake, especially in Europe and the United States.

Gazyva/Gazyvaro sales came in at CHF 730 million, up 9%.

Esbriet, indicated for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, declined 31% to CHF 718 million due to generic uptake, mainly in the United States. The first generic versions were launched in May 2022.

Ophthalmology drug Vabysmo (approved in 2022) sales came in at CHF 591 million, as sales of this new eye medicine showed an excellent uptake.

Revenues in the Diagnostics division increased by 3%. The Point of Care businesses recorded strong growth (+17%).

2023 Guidance

Roche expects a decrease in total sales in the low single digit range (at constant exchange rates) due to the sharp decline in sales of COVID-19 products of roughly CHF 5 billion. Excluding this impact, sales growth is anticipated to be solid in both divisions. Core earnings per share are targeted to develop broadly in line with sales decline.

Pipeline Updates

In November, Roche announced results from the GRADUATE I and II studies evaluating gantenerumab in people with early Alzheimer’s disease. The studies did not meet their primary endpoint of slowing clinical decline.

Our Take

Roche’s performance in 2022 was ordinary and significantly lower COVID-19-related sales impacted the top line even though new drugs, namely Ocrevus, Hemlibra, Evrysdi and Tecentriq recorded growth and the uptake of the new eye drug Vabysmo (launched at the beginning of 2022) was outstanding.

2023 is also expected to be challenging for the company due to the expected sharp decline in sales of COVID-19 products of roughly CHF 5 billion.

Competition from biosimilars for established cancer medicines like Avastin, MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin hurt sales, as expected. Pipeline setbacks were also disappointing.

Roche currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other top-ranked stocks in the healthcare sector are Novo Nordisk NVO and Sanofi (SNY,) both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Over the past 30 days, earnings estimates for NVO for 2023 have gained 15 cents to $4.18. NVO topped earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters and has a four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.09%, on average.

Over the past 60 days, earnings estimates for Sanofi have increased to $4.25 from $4.41 for 2023. SNY also surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 9.50.

https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/news/trial-results-snippets/roche-losing-its-perioperative-lung-cancer-lead,Roche is losing its perioperative lung cancer lead,"Roche boasted the first ever approval of a PD-(L)1 drug in perioperative lung cancer, but now looks like losing this lead. Not only did Merck & Co’s Keytruda trump it with an all-comers label in the adjuvant setting – Tecentriq’s earlier label was limited to PD-L1 expressers – Bristol Myers Squibb’s Opdivo was first with a neoadjuvant approval. This month the latter setting added two other wins, with Keytruda succeeding in the Keynote-671 trial and being filed with a 16 October Pdufa date, and Astrazeneca’s Imfinzi today scoring in the Aegean study. Meanwhile, Roche’s Impower-030 trial, in a similar setting to Keynote-671 and Aegean, is mired in delays, having initially been due to yield data in 2021. In January Cowen analysts were still expecting imminent readout, but at its fourth-quarter results call Roche quietly slipped out the fact that Impower-030 was continuing to 2024, suggesting that interim analysis had failed to show a positive effect.

https://www.shu.edu/business/news/you-are-invited-entrepreneur-masterclass-on-startups.cfm,"Entrepreneur Masterclass Featuring Gabino and Stephen Roche, Co-Founders of Saphyre, a Fintech Startup","Seton Hall University 2023 Entrepreneur Hall of Fame inductees Gabino and Stephen Roche, co-founders Saphyre, will speak about their entrepreneurial journey and provide students with valuable information and tools for starting a business at an entrepreneurship masterclass on Wednesday, March 29. This exciting masterclass will take place from 5-6 p.m. in the newly renovated University Center Theater on the Seton Hall University South Orange campus. The Roches will speak about how they are building their fintech startup which is revolutionizing back-office operations in their industry. All students and faculty are invited.

To register for the event please click HERE.

Following successful corporate careers in finance and technology, twin brothers Gabino and Stephen Roche launched Saphyre, an innovative and disruptive financial technology (fintech) venture, in 2017.

Since then, the Stillman School-educated Gabino and his brother Stephen have embarked on a nonstop mission to revolutionize the way brokerage firms, custodian banks, investment managers and other financial companies manage the manual-intensive process of managing client trading accounts. Saphyre’s key to success is its patent-approved AI technology that digitizes and speeds the pre-trading space, while providing trading and post-trade benefits for financial institutions at the same time. The company, which holds 105 patents, has dramatically increased the efficiency of back-office operations that formerly were accomplished with faxes, emails, phone calls and spreadsheets. Saphyre, based in Hoboken, N.J., secured $18.7 million in Series-A funding in 2022, and clients and investors include JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Blackrock, Inc.

The Roches, who are involved in many professional and community organizations, will be honored at the Seton Hall University Entrepreneur Hall of Fame Reception immediately following the entrepreneur masterclass event.

https://www.dechert.com/knowledge/news/2023/2/dechert-obtains-a-major-victory-for-roche-before-the-paris-court.html,Dechert Obtains a Major Victory for Roche Before the Paris Court of Appeal With the Complete Annulment of the French Competition Authority’s Decision,"Dechert has successfully represented the Roche group before the Paris Court of Appeal in its appeal of the French Competition Authority’s decision n° 20-D-11 of 9 September 2020, which had penalized several entities of the Roche and Novartis groups with a fine totaling EUR 444 million for an alleged abuse of a collective dominant position in the French market for the treatment of wet AMD. In a judgment rendered on 16 February 2023, the Court of Appeal embraced Roche's arguments, finding that there was no infringement of competition law and, consequently, entirely annulling the French Competition Authority's decision.

After more than eight years of legal battle, the court finally recognized the merits of the arguments made by Roche both before the French Competition Authority and on appeal. First, it confirmed that, since the Bertrand law of December 2011, which aimed to reinforce the safeguards relating to the off-label use of drugs (i.e., without authorization) following the Mediator scandal, Lucentis® – authorized for the treatment of wet AMD and marketed in France by Novartis – on the one hand, and Avastin® – authorized for the treatment of certain cancers unrelated to the eye and marketed in France by Roche – on the other hand, could not legally be regarded as competing products.

Second, and above all, the Court of Appeal rightfully ruled that Roche's responses to the health authorities' inquiries about the potential risks associated with the off-label intravitreal use of Avastin® for the treatment of wet AMD, a use for which this product had neither been developed nor authorized, were neither alarmist nor misleading, particularly in a context of great scientific uncertainty and worrying reports coming at the time of the alleged practices from both the French regional health authorities and foreign health authorities.

The judgment sets an important limit on the increasing interference of the French Competition Authority in cases relating to the marketing of health products, and notably recalls that the action of public authorities in the pharmaceutical sector must be guided first and foremost by the need to ensure patient safety and safeguard public health, and not by purely mercantile considerations.

Dechert’s team included partners Mélanie Thill-Tayara and Laurence Bary, national partner Marion Provost and associate Pénélope Agosta for the antitrust aspects as well as partner Sophie Pelé and associate Margaux Lasseigne for the pharma regulatory aspects.

https://www.roche.com/stories/building-bridges-in-personalised-healthcare/,Planning for the future: a new framework for improving health outcomes worldwide,"Personalisation of healthcare promises a fundamental shift from treating disease to delivering the best possible care for each person throughout their lives. This whole-person approach can improve every aspect of someone’s health experience, from preventing disease and staying healthy to early and accurate diagnosis, tailored treatment with the right interventions at the right time, and real-time monitoring and management of disease to achieve improved outcomes.

Progress in science, data and technology is making it possible to advance this tailored approach to care like never before, particularly in the field of oncology. However, to realise the benefit of these advancements, existing pathways for healthcare delivery need to evolve. Healthcare systems must navigate away from traditional ‘point-in-time,’ one-size-fits-all solutions and embrace a framework that starts with the individual’s unique health characteristics and needs, delivering care in a more personalised, holistic way.

This shift will make it possible to optimise individual outcomes and minimise inefficiencies and waste across healthcare systems, but only if we address the barriers limiting access to the tests, technologies and innovative treatments that enable personalised care. Since the complexities of delivering healthcare vary widely from country to country, a framework that can be adapted to address local barriers and challenges – much as personalised care addresses individual needs -- needs to be created.",[],
https://www.roche.com/stories/bringing-digital-innovation-to-patients-faster/,New ways to bring digital innovation to patients faster,"New digital approaches and technologies are connecting medical solutions, providers and patients more closely than ever. This enables better insights and wider access — fast tracking the digital evolution of healthcare. Partnerships and evolving collaboration models with Medtech companies and startups accelerate innovation, so we can bring new diagnostics solutions to healthcare professionals and patients faster.

Digitalisation has been a huge catalyst to turn evolving technologies, data insights and medical expertise into new healthcare solutions at speed and scale. This will help patients to benefit from diagnostic innovations when and where they need them most. To deliver the full digital potential, collaboration across the healthcare industry is key - and with it the evolution of new partnership models that will transform the future of Diagnostics. Digital ecosystems: bringing the best ideas together faster A new digital ecosystem for point-of-care settings was recently introduced by Roche Diagnostics, created by cobas® pulse. This device for glucose monitoring is powered by cobas® infinity edge smart software which safely and securely connects information gathered with the device across multiple settings. It also enables healthcare professionals to access external innovations from anywhere. The ecosystem launched with six applications from different Medtech start-ups; many additional applications are in the pipeline. Smart4Diagnostics (S4DX) and CardioSignal are two of the pioneering Medtech collaborators participating in this ecosystem created by Roche Diagnostics. The companies initially met in Startup Creasphere, a leading digital health innovation programme initiated by Roche and Plug & Play that strives to transform healthcare together with start-ups. Being part of Roche’s digital ecosystem via the cobas infinity edge, these new apps can be used right at the point of care – along with many other apps that help diagnose and monitor patients.

“Many great ideas come from small companies, but the successful implementation of an idea in real practice needs a strong partner who understands the customer’s needs. We are based in Munich, so we might understand the German market, but we might not understand the Lithuanian market, or the Spanish market, and this is where Roche has great expertise.” Hans Maria Heyn Founder and CEO, SD4X

How to bring digital innovations to patients worldwide Smart4Diagnostics offers the S4DX app-based digital solution to track the quality and efficiency of the sample workflow from its point of collection from a patient to the analyzer in the lab. It is during this process – between blood collection and lab analysis – where many errors can occur in the diagnostic process. The SD4X app helps lab leaders close the gap, improving overall medical quality and reducing errors before the samples even reach the labs. CardioSignal works differently; its application helps healthcare professionals detect a patient’s atrial fibrillation – one of the most common manifestations of heart disease. By placing the cobas pulse device on the chest for just one minute, the application on the device can easily monitor the patient’s heart function in real-time. Why are external tech companies working with Roche Diagnostics on these innovative patient solutions?

“We strongly benefit from the experience of Roche and its deep market knowledge so we can learn how to operate in this field. The key for our collaboration is that we can really learn from each other’s insights to build new disruptive technologies for cardiac disease detection together.” Juuso Blomster CEO, CardioSignal

Bringing diagnostics closer to patients and innovators closer to healthcare Roche Diagnostics uses cloud-based platforms to build digital ecosystems – integrating data via different applications, IT networks and diagnostics devices. Similar to apps on mobile phones, healthcare apps from a variety of tech collaborators can be hosted on existing diagnostic devices. With the right infrastructure and enablers in place, this means healthcare professionals and point of care coordinators have everything they require on a single device. This makes it easy and efficient to gain precise information right at the point of care where it’s needed most. Another advantage is that hospitals and labs adopting these integrated innovative tools for novel insights can rely on Roche’s high quality, data privacy and safety standards. This in turn, enables tech companies to gain faster access to new customers and users around the globe. The biggest benefit of all, of course, is for patients themselves. When healthcare data flows seamlessly and directly between patients and healthcare providers, it’s much easier to manage health, prescribe medicines or give care instructions even when patients are at home. Higher medical value through algorithms - it’s just the beginning “Our vision is that cobas infinity edge smart software solutions is just the start,” says Corinne Dive-Reclus, Head of Lab Insights at Roche Information Solutions. Corinne is a strong ambassador for new, digital innovations that connect data in a seamless flow between labs, hospitals, pharmacies, primary care, and patients at home. “Besides creating a digital ecosystem, third-party technologies connected to new digital infrastructure such as cobas infinity edge show high potential for improving patient care using platform-based models of collaborative innovation.”

“We’re looking for people and ideas to help us innovate across the care continuum: from pre-pre-analytics to digital pathology, and with clinical algorithms in areas like oncology, neuroscience, and rare diseases.” Corinne Dive-Reclus Head of Lab Insights, Roche Information Solutions

Transforming healthcare calls for new relationships Creating new approaches to external collaboration and fostering innovative, high-value partnerships will be crucial to transform healthcare over the next few years. Platforms that can facilitate the creation of digital ecosystems will make it easier for tech innovators and start-ups to participate and bring their new capabilities to multiple stakeholders across healthcare.

“We aim to bring High Medical Value solutions to patients faster. For this, we need to team up with the best minds and tech innovators across the healthcare industry. Only by working together can we bring the most promising new ideas to patients around the globe with speed and scale.” Cristin Hubbard Global Head of Partnering, Roche Diagnostics

Cristin Hubbard, Global Head of Partnering at Roche Diagnostics explains: “We see incredible potential in digital ecosystems, and we’re excited to explore new partnerships and collaboration models at the interface between diagnostics and health-tech industries.”

Basel, 7 February 2023 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced positive results from the global phase III COMMODORE 2 study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of crovalimab in people with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) who have not been previously treated with complement inhibitors. The study met its co-primary efficacy endpoints of transfusion avoidance and control of haemolysis (the ongoing destruction of red blood cells measured by lactate dehydrogenase levels). Results showed that crovalimab, a novel, investigational anti-C5 recycling monoclonal antibody, given as a subcutaneous injection every four weeks, achieved disease control and was non-inferior to eculizumab, a current standard of care, which is given intravenously every two weeks.

The efficacy and safety data from the separate phase III COMMODORE 1 study in people with PNH switching from currently approved C5 inhibitors to crovalimab, supported the favourable benefit-risk profile of crovalimab, as seen in the pivotal COMMODORE 2 study.

“People with PNH may benefit from more options to achieve robust disease control with less frequent treatment intervals,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “As the first global phase III data for crovalimab, these results emphasise its potential to address these needs. We look forward to submitting these data to regulatory authorities, bringing us one step closer to making crovalimab available for people with PNH around the world.”

PNH is a rare and life-threatening blood condition in which red blood cells are destroyed by the complement system. This causes symptoms such as anaemia, fatigue, blood clots and kidney disease.1 C5 inhibitors can be effective in treating the condition.2 Crovalimab has been engineered to be recycled within the circulation, enabling sustained complement inhibition through low dose, subcutaneous administration every four weeks. 3, 4

Data from both studies will be submitted to regulatory authorities around the world and presented at an upcoming medical meeting. Positive data from the phase III COMMODORE 3 study in China were presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition on 10 December 2022. Data from the COMMODORE 3 study have been submitted via China’s Centre for Drug Evaluation Breakthrough Therapy Designation pathway. This submission has been accepted under Priority Review for approval consideration by China’s National Medical Products Administration.

About the COMMODORE 1 and 2 studies

The COMMODORE 2 study is a phase III, randomised, open-label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of crovalimab versus eculizumab in people with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) who have not been previously treated with C5 inhibitors. The study’s co-primary efficacy endpoints measure transfusion avoidance and control of haemolysis (the ongoing destruction of red blood cells measured by lactate dehydrogenase levels). The adults enrolled in the study were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to be treated with either subcutaneous (SC) crovalimab every four weeks or intravenous (IV) eculizumab every two weeks. The participants who were less than 18 years old were included in a non-randomised treatment arm and were treated with SC crovalimab every four weeks.5

The COMMODORE 1 study is a phase III, randomised, open-label study evaluating the safety of crovalimab in people with PNH switching from currently approved C5 inhibitors. The study’s outcome measures evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic properties of crovalimab. The study included people (18 years of age or older) currently treated with eculizumab. In a non-randomised arm, the study also included paediatrics (<18 years of age) currently treated with eculizumab, people currently treated with ravulizumab, people currently treated with off-label doses of eculizumab (higher than the approved dose for PNH: more than 900mg per dose and/or more frequently than every two weeks), or people with known mutations in the C5 gene who do not respond to current therapies.6

About Crovalimab

Crovalimab is an investigational, novel anti-C5 recycling monoclonal antibody designed to block the complement system – a vital part of the innate immune system that acts as the body’s first line of defence against infection. Crovalimab has been engineered to address the medical needs of people living with complement-mediated diseases, including providing patients with a potential at-home administration option.

Crovalimab works by binding to C5, blocking the last step of the complement cascade and is also recycled into circulation, enabling rapid and sustained complement inhibition.3, 4 Crovalimab’s recycling action also enables low dose SC administration every four weeks. In addition, crovalimab binds to a different C5 binding site from current treatments, which has the potential to provide an effective treatment option for people with specific C5 gene mutations, who do not respond to current therapies.3 Crovalimab is being investigated in a clinical development programme, including five ongoing phase III studies.5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Crovalimab is being evaluated in PNH, atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome, sickle cell disease, and other complement mediated diseases.

Public-private partnerships contribute to strengthening laboratory systems by leveraging the respective strengths, experience, and resources of the partners

About 2 billion people worldwide are estimated to be infected with tuberculosis and more than 38 million people globally are living with HIV, including over 6 million undiagnosed.

BASEL, Switzerland, Feb. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Roche‌ (SIX:‌ ‌RO,‌ ‌ROG;‌ ‌OTCQX:‌ ‌RHHBY)‌ announced today the expansion of its collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to strengthen laboratory capabilities in countries greatly affected by the HIV and tuberculosis (TB) epidemics. Through the implementation of a public-private partnership (PPP), named ""Lab Networks for Health,"" Roche and the CDC will seek to improve HIV and tuberculosis prevention, detection, and treatment outcomes in select countries of Africa, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Western Hemisphere (e.g., Latin America, Central America, and Caribbean Regions).

Specifically, Roche and CDC intend to increase laboratory human resource capacity building through expanded training interventions and to support laboratory quality management systems and improvement programs. The partners will also seek to optimise laboratory workflows and integrated diagnostics networks to increase access to multi-pathogen testing capabilities to enhance pandemic preparedness. In addition, they will work to improve local and regional capacity for effective laboratory waste management and related biosafety approaches.

''We are proud to continue our longstanding partnership with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to further support efforts that scale up and expand access to diagnostics for tuberculosis, HIV, and emerging pandemics"", said Bernard Colombo, President Europe Middle East, Africa, and Latin America of Roche Diagnostics. ''Investments in strong laboratory networks contribute to the strengthening of health systems that enable people to have access to life-saving testing and treatment for improved disease management and quality of life.""

""CDC's global laboratory-supported systems and networks are critical for detecting and monitoring HIV and tuberculosis and have also been vital in the response to COVID-19 and other disease outbreaks,"" said Dr. Hank Tomlinson, Director of CDC's Division of Global HIV and TB. ""Our renewed partnership with Roche Diagnostics will help to sustain these essential platforms, enhance laboratory workforce capacity, and identify efficiencies in multi-disease public health laboratory systems to ensure accurate, reliable, and responsive diagnostic services globally.""

All activities under the PPP will be developed in a manufacturer-agnostic and collaborative manner among representatives from CDC, including country offices, Roche global and regional offices, and host country Ministries of Health, with the goal of creating and improving local and regional institutional capacity for laboratory systems strengthening.

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted progress towards reaching the World Health Organization (WHO) HIV and tuberculosis elimination goals and brought challenges to health care systems across countries and communities, putting lives at risk. A recent UNAIDS report highlighted the faltering progress for HIV programs, with approximately 1.5 million new infections occurring in 2021; more than 1 million over the global target.¹ Reversing years of declines, about 10.6 million people worldwide became ill with tuberculosis in 2021, and only 6.4 million of them were diagnosed, according to global reporting.2

About the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

Summary Companies Q3 sales down 6% to 17.74 bln Swiss francs

Increase in COVID cases has not boosted demand for tests, drugs

CEO: demand in China recovering but not yet at pre-COVID level















Oct 18 (Reuters) - Roche's (ROG.S) quarterly sales declined 6% as a slump in COVID-19 treatments and diagnostic testing outweighed gains from haemophilia treatment Hemlibra and multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus.

Third-quarter revenue slipped to 14.74 billion Swiss francs ($14.84 billion), below market expectations of about 15.5 billion francs.

""The third quarter of 2022 was particularly challenging due to base effects, as the demand for COVID-19 medicines and tests was exceptionally high in the same quarter of 2021,"" the Swiss company said in a statement on Tuesday.

""Despite an increasing incidence rate for COVID-19, actually, we don't see an increase in the demand for COVID-19-related products,"" Chief Executive Severin Schwan told journalists in a call, adding this was valid for both tests as well as drugs Ronapreve and Actemra.

Its bestseller Ocrevus gained 16% in sales to 1.52 billion francs during the quarter, while Hemlibra jumped 23% to 952 million francs, both excluding the effect of currency swings.

However, analysts at brokerage Jefferies said sales gains in Hemlibra and cancer immunotherapy Tecentriq fell short of market expectations.

The company reaffirmed its guidance for full-year revenue to be flat or grow by a ""low-single digit"" percentage, when excluding foreign exchange effects.

It also reiterated that the percentage gain in core earnings per share would be in the ""low- to mid-single digit"" range.

Demand in China was recovering as people started seeing their doctors again after harsh lockdown measures but was not yet back to pre-pandemic levels, Roche's CEO said.

Roche repeated that keenly awaited trial data on experimental Alzheimer's drug gantenerumab was due to be published at the end of November.

Market expectations have picked up after rivals Eisai (4523.T) and Biogen (BIIB.O) last month reported positive results on a drug that targets the same protein type, but Schwan declined to comment on any implications for gantenerumab.

https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/01/02/better-large-cap-roche-holding-or-gilead-sciences/,Better Large-Cap Buy: Roche Holding or Gilead Sciences Stock?,"Roche Holding (RHHBY -0.70%) and Gilead Sciences (GILD -0.32%) both saw increased sales during the pandemic, due in part to their COVID-19 products. For Gilead, it was its COVD-19 antiviral, Veklury, and for Roche, its revenue was boosted mostly by coronavirus tests.

Now the large-cap drug companies are looking for growth beyond COVID-19 sales. Gilead's shares have glittered in 2022, with the stock up more than 16%, while Roche's have fallen more than 23% so far this year. The question is, which healthcare stock is the better buy now?

Oncology, HIV therapies give Gilead an edge

Gilead reported third-quarter revenue of $6.99 billion, down 5%, year over year, and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.42, down from $2.05 in the third quarter of 2021. Through nine months, Gilead's revenue of $19.9 billion represents a drop of 1% over 2021.

The combination of the stock's rise and declining revenue has made Gilead a little pricier as it trades for 32 times earnings. In the long run, however, there's reason for optimism, because, if you take out Veklury sales from the equation, the company's third-quarter revenue would have been up 11% over the same period last year. The company also has an active pipeline, including 15 ongoing phase 3 trials.

The company's growing stable of HIV and oncology therapies should continue to drive the company's sales. HIV therapy sales rose 7% year over year to $4.5 billion, and the company just got approval on Dec. 22 from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Sunlenca as a twice-yearly treatment for multidrug-resistant HIV.

The company's third-quarter oncology sales rose 79% year over year, led by three cell therapies: Trodelvy, Yescarta, and Tecartus. Breast cancer drug Trodelvy saw sales of $180 million, up 78% over the same period last year. Yescarta, used to treat large B-cell lymphoma, saw sales climb 81% year over year to $318 million, and Tecartus, which has been approved to treat relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, saw sales rise to $81 million, up 78% over the same period last year.

Gilead raised its quarterly dividend by 2.8% this year to $0.73 per share, equaling a yield of around 3.45%, nearly double that of the S&P 500 average. The company has raised its dividend every year since it began offering one in 2015.

Roche is priced at a discount

Roche's growing portfolio and pipeline of oncology and immunology drugs sets it apart. In December, the company got two key approvals for Hemlibra and Lunsumio.

Hemlibra, already approved by the FDA to treat hemophilia A with inhibitors, was approved in Europe to expand that label to treat moderate hemophilia A patients without factor VIII inhibitors on Dec. 16. It's likely that an FDA approval for that indication will follow.

Lunsumio, a bispecific antibody, was given FDA approval on Dec. 23 to treat adults with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma who have had two or more types of previous therapies. The drug is also in several clinical trials as a combination and monotherapy to treat various B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and other blood cancers. Follicular lymphoma is the most common form of slow-acting non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

The Swiss pharmaceutical company, which trades for around 16 times earnings, is making up for lost sales from its COVID-19 therapy. Revenue for the third quarter was $25.5 billion, down 7% year over year, but through nine months it reported revenue of $50.69 billion, compared to $50.36 billion in the same period last year. Nine-month diagnostic sales were $14.9 billion, up 4% over the same period last year.

Pharmaceutical sales were flat at $33.2 billion, but the company saw increased sales for Hemlibra (up 28% year to date), multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus (up 27%), spinal muscular atrophy drug Evrysdi (up 101%), and Phesgo, a breast cancer therapy, whose sales are up 150% over the first nine months of 2022.

It's also seeing strong sales from eye drug Vabysmo, which launched at the beginning of this year. Plus, the company has a large late-stage pipeline with 17 phase 3 studies expected to conclude in 2023.

Roche has an above-average dividend, which it raised by 1.6% this year to $1.24 per share, representing a yield of around 1.97%.

Sometimes, the choice is difficult

Both stocks seem to be finding replacements for lost COVID-19 sales, but of the two, Roche seems to be the better buy right now. With a price-to-earnings ratio of 16.6, it trades for nearly half the P/E that Gilead does. On top of that, Roche has a few more late-stage therapies in its pipeline and, through nine months, has already seen a revenue improvement year over year.

The one advantage Gilead has is a better dividend yield, but that's not enough to make up for declining revenue numbers.",['Jim Halley'],2023-01-02 00:00:00
https://www.science.org/content/article/roche-alzheimer-s-antibody-fails-slow-cognitive-decline-major-test,Roche Alzheimer’s antibody fails to slow cognitive decline in major test,"The second (and third) time was not the charm for Roche’s experimental antibody drug for Alzheimer’s disease. The company last night announced gantenerumab had failed to show a statistically significant benefit in two large, late-stage clinical trials that tested its ability to slow patients’ cognitive decline—echoing a previous failure in another so-called phase 3 trial.

“This news is very disappointing to deliver,” Levi Garraway, Roche’s chief medical officer, said in the company’s statement.

The setback comes amid new hints that antibodies targeting beta amyloid, a protein that builds up in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients, could finally break through as treatments for the memory-robbing neurodegenerative disorder. Earlier this year, Biogen and Eisai announced their jointly developed antiamyloid antibody lecanemab had scored an apparent win in a major clinical trial, although many questions remain about it. And Biogen in 2021 won U.S. approval for another antiamyloid antibody, aducanumab, although its effectiveness is modest at best and few patients are receiving the drug, as the U.S. Medicare system has so far declined to pay for it.

Roche launched its first phase 3 trial of gantenerumab in early 2014 but halted it early, at the end of that year, when an interim analysis showed the intervention wasn’t working. Many researchers were surprised by the company’s decision to try again, with higher doses of the antibody, in two more trials, which enrolled nearly 2000 people with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s across 30 countries.

In those trials, subcutaneous injections of gantenerumab, which targets a different part of the amyloid protein than other antibodies, only slowed cognitive decline by 6% or 8% compared with placebo—a result Roche acknowledged was not statistically significant. The company added that the amount of beta amyloid removed by the treatment was “lower than expected.” That may cloud any attempt to discern whether the studies support or challenge the idea that beta amyloid directly harms neurons, the dominant but increasingly challenged hypothesis about what causes Alzheimer’s disease.

Roche said more information would be provided later this month at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease conference. The company did note that the incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), the brain swelling and fluid buildup often seen with this class of antibodies, was 25% in the pooled gantenerumab-treated arms of the two trials, significantly more than the reported amount for lecanemab. Most ARIA cases were mild, the company said, and did not force doctors to discontinue treatment. Roche did not report how many were the more severe “hemorrhagic” form that involves bleeding in the brain, although it stated the number of those cases was “balanced across the gantenerumab and placebo groups.”

Based on past studies of gantenerumab, many scientists and biotech analysts had given it a poor chance of succeeding in the two trials. Even advocates of the amyloid hypothesis had low expectations. “Gantenerumab was the weakest candidate in the series [of antibodies], so I am not surprised that this antibody did not work,” Bart De Strooper, director of the UK Dementia Research Institute, told Science in an email. “The whole thing boils down to what is needed to get positive results in a trial. There is a lag phase during which amyloid plaque load is decreased [and] you will only see clinical gain once this lowering has happened below a threshold. Thus, if you have an antibody that takes too long to remove the plaques, your trial will be finished before you see benefits.

Still, David Holtzman, an Alzheimer’s disease researcher at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, noted the company did see “a subtle trend for less cognitive slowing.” The less-than-anticipated drop in amyloid levels “could be a major reason that the clinical results were not as robust as expected,” he said.

The Alzheimer’s Association, too, sought some positive news in the drug’s failure, saying in a statement, “The trials further illustrate the relationship between removal of amyloid-beta and reduction of clinical decline. We are seeing great progress and innovation in this class of treatment, and we learn from each trial.”

Many in the field will now hope for better results from another antiamyloid antibody, Eli Lilly and Company’s donanemab, which is nearing the end of its own phase 3 trial. But some see the Roche results as more reason to be wary of the one apparent success in the field, Biogen and Eisai’s lecanemab.

“This is another blow to the approach of attacking amyloid beta in the brain to slow down the progression or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease,” said University of Reading neurophysiologist Francesco Tamagnini in comments to the Science Media Centre. “Now more than ever, it is important to promote more basic research to understand the different ways the disease develops and identify new targets for treatment.”",['John Travis'],
https://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/othersport/arid-41117944.html,Ben Healy emulates Stephen Roche with podium finish at Amstel Gold,"Ben Healy has become only the third Irish rider in history to finish on the podium at the Amstel Gold Race, the 22-year old emulating the great Stephen Roche from 1982 by finishing runner up on Sunday.

The result comes on the back of some scintillating performances this season and Sunday was proof - if it was needed - that the EF Education-EasyPost rider has arrived at the very top level of the sport.

He was just 40 seconds down on winner and two-time Tour de France champion Tadej Pogacar (UAE Team Emirates) after dispatching a host of the sports luminaries including Olympic Champion and British phenomenon Tom Pidcock in the final 10 kilometres.

Sean Kelly is the only other Irish rider to finish on any step of the podium at Amstel Gold, a sure sign that Healy is headed in the right direction in his still fledgling career.

Just last Wednesday in Belgium he was again runner-up in a major one-day race, De Brabantse Pijl, and it's all the more impressive given he broke a bone in his hand in a crash racing in France in early February.

Another Irishman who really shone on the continent over the weekend is Tyrone teenager Darren Rafferty, riding in the colours of the American team Hagens Berman Axeon.

Rafferty, 19, finished a brilliant fifth in the U23 edition of Liege-Bastogne-Liege, a hilly 174-kilometre contest where he proved one of the main protagonists.

He was in a group of just 13 riders who came to the line together to contest a dramatically reduced sprint, but he just missed out on a career-best result.

Elsewhere, Megan Armitage continued her fine form with an excellent fourth place GP Feminin de Chambery in the south-east of France, the Arkea Pro Cycling team rider finishing just over a minute down on winner Victorie Guilman (FDZ-Suez).

Armitage is a relative newcomer to the sport but has made huge strides in the last two seasons, her best result coming last month in Spain when she won two stages and the overall of the Vuelta Extremadura.","['Brian Canty', 'Sun', 'Apr']",2023-04-16 17:45:00+01:00

Nov 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. health regulator on Tuesday issued an emergency use authorization to Roche's (ROG.S) test for the detection of DNA from monkeypox virus in swab specimens collected from people suspected of the virus infection.

The tests will be conducted on the Swiss company's cobas systems, which can also detect HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses.

The Food and Drug Administration said testing will be limited to laboratories that meet the requirements to perform moderate or high complexity tests.

While around 80,000 cases of monkeypox have been reported in nearly 100 countries since the outbreak started earlier this year, the number of cases have declined from the peak in August. Over 28,000 cases have been reported in the United States in the outbreak this year, including two deaths.

The World Health Organization continues to classify the disease as a public health emergency of international concern, which is its highest level of alert. The U.S. has also declared the disease a public health emergency.

Understanding a patient's brain tumour mutation status in the IDH1 and ATRX genes enables more informed clinical decisions and may improve patient outcomes.

The IDH1 R132H and ATRX antibodies are the latest additions to Roche’s neuropathology portfolio, which contains 29 biomarkers.





Basel, 23 February 2023 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today the launch of the IDH1 R132H (MRQ-67) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody and the ATRX Rabbit Polyclonal Antibody to identify mutation status in patients diagnosed with brain cancer.

A brain tumour is formed when there is an abnormal growth of cells in the brain. There are two main types of cells in the brain: neurons, the communicators of the nervous system and glial cells, which support and protect neurons and maintain the body’s natural state of balance. Gliomas, brain tumours that develop from glial cells, are the most prevalent type of malignant brain tumours in adults.1

Gliomas that have mutations in the IDH1 and ATRX genes are biologically distinct from tumours that do not carry these mutations. Knowing a patient’s IDH1 and ATRX mutation status enables clinicians to provide personalised care to patients based on their specific tumour classification, including a more informed prognosis, the selection of targeted therapies and inclusion in clinical trials.2

“A patient's IDH1 status helps determine eligibility for clinical trials, which offers more treatment options, and may one day lead to potential targeted therapies for people fighting brain cancer,” said Matt Sause, CEO of Roche Diagnostics.

Time is critical for patients fighting brain cancer. Patients diagnosed with glioblastoma, the most common brain cancer in adults, have an average survival rate of less than one year. Having an understanding of a glioma patient's mutation status will enable clinicians to quickly determine the optimum treatment path for that patient and help predict therapeutic outcomes.

Immunohistochemistry is recommended by all major glioma practice guidelines for determining IDH1 R132H and ATRX mutation status.3-5 When compared to sequencing, identification of IDH1 R132H mutations via immunohistochemistry has been shown to be more accurate, rapid, accessible and cost effective.6 The IDH1 assay can also detect the IDH1 R132H mutation in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).

Roche’s IDH1 and ATRX assays are optimised and fully-automated on the BenchMark series of instruments. The two tests are now available in the US. They will likely be available in other non-CE markets later this year and in countries that accept the CE mark in 2024.

About the IDH1 R132H (MRQ-67) Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody and the ATRX Rabbit Polyclonal Antibody

Roche’s IDH1 R132H (MRQ-67) Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody can detect the IDH1 R132H mutation in adult-type gliomas and in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). When present, IDH1 R132H is associated with a relatively favourable prognosis and is important in patient stratification for clinical trials.2 IDH1 R132H immunohistochemistry is recommended by all major glioma clinical practice guidelines as the initial IDH testing modality.3-5 Roche’s ATRX Rabbit Polyclonal Antibody detects a mutation in the ATRX gene, providing significant diagnostic and prognostic information to clinicians. ATRX testing is considered “desirable” by the World Health Organization for IDH-mutant gliomas.3

Data from the Phase III CONTACT-03 study showed the combination of Roche’s Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Exelixis’ Cabometyx (cabozantinib) fell short of its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

While details were sparse, Exelixis reported Thursday that the Cabometyx-Tecentriq combination failed to significantly improve PFS in patients with locally advanced, metastatic clear cell or non-clear RCC, when compared with Cabometyx alone.

The company will present full findings and analyses at an upcoming medical meeting.

CONTACT-03 is a randomized and open-label study that enrolled 522 participants to determine whether a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor had clinical benefit in RCC after disease progression.

Aside from PFS, CONTACT-03 also evaluated overall survival, though data were immature at the time of the interim analysis, a Roche spokesperson told BioSpace.

The combination treatment had a safety profile consistent with the known side effects for the individual agents. No new safety signals were identified.

Roche and Exelixis entered into a clinical trial collaboration in 2017 when the two initiated a Phase Ib dose-escalation study to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment in locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

The partnership is built on the synergistic promise between the two therapies. Cabometyx is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that, in pre-clinical studies, has been shown to foster an “immunopermissive environment,” according to Exelixis, making tumor cells more sensitive to immune responses.

This mechanism of action makes Cabometyx a good candidate for combination therapy with an immune agent such as Tecentriq, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and facilitates a stronger cytotoxic immune response.

Over the years, however, this synergy has yielded mixed results.

In December 2022, Roche and Exelixis suffered a late-stage defeat when the regimen failed to improve overall survival in the Phase III CONTACT-01 study in non-small cell lung cancer. The combo was given as a second-line treatment and compared against the combination of Cabometyx and docetaxel.

More promising results have recently emerged from the combination of Cabometyx and Bristol Myers Squibb’s Opdivo (nivolumab).

In February, three-year follow-up data from the Phase III CheckMate -9ER study showed Cabometyx could induce long-term survival and response rates in RCC when given as a front-line treatment with Opdivo. The treatment combination was compared against Pfizer's Sutent (sunitinib).

In January 2021, the FDA approved the combination of Cabometyx and Opdivo for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. Cabometyx is also indicated as a monotherapy for previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma.",[],
https://www.biospace.com/article/hookipa-partners-with-roche-on-broad-kras-inhibitor-program/,Roche and Hookipa Tie Up in KRAS Inhibitor Deal Valued at Potential $950M (Updated),"Roche and Austria-based Hookipa Pharma tied up a licensing and research and development collaboration valued at more than $950 million focused on KRAS-mutated cancers.

The deal, announced Thursday, focuses on Hookipa’s HB-700 program, an investigational arenaviral immunotherapy for the treatment of KRAS-mutated cancers.

Roche also has the option to license a second undisclosed novel arenaviral immunotherapy.

For Hookipa, the collaboration with the Swiss pharma giant is its first oncology licensing deal and investors appear to favor the move; the company stock is up 40% Thursday.

HB-700 is designed to treat KRAS-mutated tumors including cancers of the lungs, pancreas and colorectal malignancies. HB-700 is a replicating 2-vector therapy that targets the most common KRAS mutations; G12D, G12V, G12R, G12C and G13D.

KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog) is a gene responsible for controlling cell growth and maintaining regular signaling and proliferation. Mutations of KRAS leads to uncontrolled cell division and are responsible for multiple solid tumors.

Inhibition of KRAS mutations has become a popular target for oncology companies like Roche.

There are several drugs that target KRAS mutations.

Amgen won accelerated FDA approval for Lumakras (sotorasib), a treatment for patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

Mirati Therapeutics is seeking approval for its KRAS G12C-focused adagrasib. A PDUFA date has been set for Dec. 14.

Other companies focused on KRAS mutations include Merck, Eli Lilly, Moderna and Boehringer Ingelheim.

Seven years ago, Roche won approval for a KRAS diagnostics test. The cobas KRAS Mutation test is designed to identify KRAS mutations in tumor samples from metastatic colorectal cancer patients.

In 2020, Roche subsidiary Genentech licensed RG6433, an SHP2 inhibitor from Relay Therapeutics and has since advanced it into the clinic. The SHP2 enzyme is believed to play a role in regulating KRAS between its “on” and “off” states.

Hookipa and Roche see HB-700 as an opportunity to simultaneously target a broader range of KRAS mutations and widen the appeal of the drug, should it achieve regulatory approval.

Hookipa’s arenaviral technology has shown promise in preclinical development and in an earlier Phase I study in patients with advanced Human Papillomavirus 16-positive head and neck cancers.

Arenaviral technology has clinically demonstrated the ability to induce potent antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses, said James Sabry, global head of pharma partnering at Roche, in a statement.

Hookipa will be responsible for conducting research and early clinical development through Phase Ib.

Once those challenges have been overcome, Roche has the right to assume responsibility for further development and potential commercialization for multiple indications.

“Roche is an ideal partner, both in terms of development and reaching patients with novel cancer therapeutics,” said Joern Aldag, CEO of Hookipa said in a statement.

Aldag told BioSpace that discussions with Roche began at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting last year. Roche saw the preclinical data generated by the company and became interested in partnering with Hookipa, he said.

""We have proven in animals and now humans an antigen-specific T cell response of a magnitude you have a tough time finding anywhere else…That led to a deal with people who know oncology,” Aldag continued.

Although he was unable to provide a specific timeline, Aldag said Hookipa is between 12 and 18 months from filing an Investigational New Drug application and beginning clinical trials with HB-700.

Under terms of the deal, Hookipa will receive $25 million in an upfront cash payment. If Roche opts in on the second candidate, Hookipa will receive an additional $15 million. In all, the company will be eligible for future developmental milestones valued at up to $930 million for both programs. Hookipa will also be eligible for tiered royalties if the assets are commercialized.",[],

Basel, 12 October 2022- Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced the launch of its next-generation portfolio SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests (“2.0”) for self-testing and professional use in countries accepting the CE Mark. Distribution of the new rapid test portfolio is projected to begin in the coming weeks.

In doing so, Roche builds upon one of the broadest portfolios of COVID-19 rapid testing solutions with three new test configurations that feature enhanced performance through the use of an improved capture antibody and the addition of new digital data sharing capabilities to all tests. Using nasopharyngeal and nasal swab samples, respectively, the tests deliver reliable results in as few as 15 minutes, aiding in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with or without symptoms consistent with COVID-19.

“The continued evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 pandemic reinforce the need for individuals and healthcare systems to have access to the most reliable rapid testing solutions possible,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO, Roche Diagnostics. “As a leader in diagnostic innovation, we are proud to be one of the first among our industry to apply insights gained from the past two years toward a next-generation rapid test portfolio. These tests are ready to support global society as we navigate this next phase of the pandemic.”

The three tests set to launch are the following:

Professional use:

SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test 2.0 (nasopharyngeal sampling)

(nasopharyngeal sampling) SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test 2.0 Nasal (nasal sampling)

Self-Test:

SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Self Test Nasal (nasal sampling)





Roche maintains the capacity to provide several tens of millions of each of the tests per month, with the option to quickly build up additional capacity if needed, to address sustained high worldwide demand for rapid testing from governments, healthcare systems and individuals. The next-generation test portfolio will be introduced in partnership with SD Biosensor Inc., with whom Roche has a global distribution agreement and previously launched a range of rapid antigen and antibody tests in more than 50 countries worldwide.

The tests join Roche Diagnostics’s broader COVID-19 portfolio, which includes a wide range of molecular, serological and digital solutions that help diagnose and manage COVID-19 during the initial stages of infection, during the recovery phase, and following the resolution of infection.

About the next-generation portfolio of SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests (“2.0”)

Lab testing showed that all three tests can qualitatively detect major variants of concern including Delta and Omicron variants. Emerging variants are continuously monitored.

SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test 2.01 (nasopharyngeal sampling)

The SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test 2.0 is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 present in human nasopharyngeal swab samples. In a prospective clinical studyA , the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen 2.0 showed a relative sensitivity of 99.00% (95% CI: 94.55 - 99.97%) and a relative specificity of 99.75% (95% CI: 98.62 - 99.99%). In total, 100 PCR-positive and 402 PCR-negative subjects participated in this study. This included 320 asymptomatic subjects, among whom 34 were positive and 286 were negative; and 182 symptomatic individuals, among whom 66 were positive and 116 were negative. This test is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of SARS‑CoV‑2 infection in individuals with or without symptoms consistent with COVID‑19. This product is intended for professional use in laboratory and near‑patient testing environments. This product is not intended for self‑testing.

SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test 2.0 Nasal2 (nasal sampling)

The SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test 2.0 Nasal is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 present in human nasal swab samples. In prospective clinical studiesA,B, the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen 2.0 Nasal showed a relative sensitivity of 95.80% (95% CI: 91.09 - 98.44%) and a relative specificity of 100% (95% CI: 99.25 - 100%). In total, 143 PCR-positive and 487 PCR-negative subjects participated in these studies. This included 320 asymptomatic subjects, among whom 34 were positive and 286 were negative; and 310 symptomatic individuals, among whom 109 were positive and 201 were negative. This test is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of SARS‑CoV‑2 infection in individuals with or without symptoms consistent with COVID‑19. This product is intended for professional use in laboratory and near‑patient testing environments. This product is not intended for self‑testing.

SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Self Test Nasal3

The enhanced SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Self Test Nasal is a so-called lateral flow test for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen in human nasal samples. This test is used to detect antigens of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in individuals suspected of having COVID-19. It is designed as a self-test for patients. In prospective clinical studiesA, B, the SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Self Test Nasal showed a relative sensitivity of 95.8% (95% CI: 91.09 - 98.44%) and a relative specificity of 100% (95% CI: 99.25 - 100%). In total, 143 PCR-positive and 487 PCR-negative subjects participated in these studies. This included 320 asymptomatic subjects, among whom 34 were positive and 286 were negative; and 310 symptomatic individuals, among whom 109 were positive and 201 were negative. 128 of the subjects were lay-users, sampling and testing themselves or another lay-user, for example their underaged childrenB.

About antigen testing

An antigen test detects proteins which are structural or functional components of a pathogen and are very specific to that pathogen. In this case, the test would provide a qualitative “yes/no” answer on the presence of the antigen in the patient sample and can be offered as a rapid strip test that is performed by healthcare professionals at the point of care or by individuals at home. If the target antigen (in this case the nucleocapsid protein) is present in sufficient concentrations in the sample, it will bind to specific antibodies and generate a visually detectable signal on the test strip, typically with results ready in 15 minutes.2 A rapid antigen test can reliably detect individuals with a high viral load allowing healthcare professionals to quickly identify those patients at the greatest risk of spreading the infection.

In general, antigen tests have a high specificity, though are not as sensitive as molecular tests that amplify the target DNA or RNA sequence in order to generate a (semi-)quantifiable signal to indicate the presence of the pathogen in a sample. Therefore, to make up for the potential decrease in sensitivity of an antigen test, negative results should be analysed together with additional information, such as the individual’s exposure history, clinical symptoms, and additional test results to help guide the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of the patient.

About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic

As a leading healthcare company, we are doing all we can to support countries in their fight against COVID-19 and minimising its impact. That is why we are working with governments, policy makers, healthcare professionals and others to help contain the COVID-19 pandemic and make sure patients continue to receive the tests, treatment and care they need.

The pandemic has profoundly raised awareness of the role diagnostics play in COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment development and disease management. Roche has developed and launched more than 20 COVID-19 diagnostics solutions, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid antigen and antibody tests. Our solutions serve the entire diagnostic continuum, from high-throughput laboratories to point-of-care and home self-testing, and cover all currently known variants. To help meet global demand, we have supplied more than 1.5 billion tests for COVID-19 since March 2020.

Roche continues to evaluate its existing therapeutic portfolio and is researching future options to help benefit patients with COVID-19. Our IL-6 inhibitor Actemra®/RoActemra® (tocilizumab) has been approved for patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 in more than 30 countries including the European Union and is authorised for emergency use in the United States. The World Health Organization has prequalified Actemra for use in patients with severe COVID-19, facilitating its availability in low- and middle-income countries. In addition, we have been improving access to Actemra by introducing an international differentiated pricing strategy, providing the medicine at cost for use in low- and middle-income countries and non asserting patents in these regions during the pandemic.

We have also been partnering with Regeneron to jointly develop the antibody combination Ronapreve™ (casirivimab and imdevimab, known as REGEN-COV™ in the US). It has been approved in multiple territories including the European Union, Japan, and Switzerland and authorised for emergency or temporary pandemic use in many countries including the US. The antibody combination has been made available to patients in more than 60 countries, across many geographies including low and middle income countries. As the virus continues to evolve, we are constantly monitoring Ronapreve’s activity against emerging variants of concern, and will share results with health authorities as soon as possible.

Our utmost goal remains to be a trusted partner who acts with urgency to save and improve the lives of patients with COVID-19 and to reduce its burden on society. For more information please visit our COVID-19 response page .

Companies Law Firms Ava Labs, Inc. Follow















(Reuters) - Kyle Roche has separated from the New York-based law firm he co-founded, Roche Freedman, following allegations that he abused investor lawsuits to aid a client, blockchain company Ava Labs Inc.

Roche ""is no longer with the firm,"" which will be renamed Freedman Normand Friedland, the cryptocurrency-focused firm said in a statement on Wednesday. ""We wish Kyle the best in his future endeavors,"" it said.

Roche did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment about the departure and his future plans.

A website called Crypto Leaks in August published secret video recordings it said showed Roche boasting he used investor class actions to harm competitors of Ava Labs, a company in which Roche and other partners at the firm had a financial stake.

Roche has previously said in a statement that the report contained falsehoods and the video was edited to remove context and obtained illegally by a person working for someone he sued.

Ava Labs did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. The company's CEO Emin Gun Sirer said in a Sept. 13 statement that Roche will no longer represent the company or hold an equity interest.

Last week a federal judge in New York removed Roche Freedman from a case representing investors who are accusing Tether of rigging cryptocurrency markets. The cryptocurrency company, which is behind the world's largest stablecoin, Tether USDT, had asked for the firm's removal after the video clips related to Ava Labs were leaked in August, citing conflicts.

The law firm did not immediately comment Thursday on the judge's Oct. 13 removal. Internet domain name records show that someone registered the website ""freedmannormand.com"" the same day as the judge order.

Roche Freedman, which is known for suing major crypto issuers and exchanges on behalf of investors, was founded in 2019 by a group of attorneys who left Boies Schiller Flexner. The two lawyers who have apparently been added to the law firm's new name, Edward Normand and Amos Friedland, are listed on its website as founding partners who came over from Boies.

The firm is also embroiled in a legal battle with Jason Cyrulnik, a former partner who claims he was ousted in an attempt to cut him out of his share of cryptocurrency worth $250 million that Ava Labs agreed to pay the firm. Roche Freedman denied the allegations and sued for a finding that it justifiably fired the attorney.

Bloomberg Law first reported on Roche's departure earlier on Wednesday.

Dec 21 (Reuters) - Roche Holding AG (ROG.S) said on Wednesday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved its monoclonal antibody for treating COVID-19 in hospitalized adult patients.

The intravenous anti-inflammatory drug, Actemra, is a monoclonal antibody that reduces inflammation and was approved in 2010 to treat rheumatoid arthritis. It is the first FDA-approved monoclonal antibody to treat COVID-19, Roche said.

The FDA authorized the emergency use of Actemra last year June to treat severe cases of COVID.

In November, the regulator pulled authorization for Eli Lilly and Co's (LLY.N) COVID monoclonal antibody treatment, bebtelovimab, saying it was not fighting the dominant BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 subvariants of Omicron as expected.

The subvariants accounted for around 69% of the cases in the United States, per government data last week.

Roche said on Wednesday the drug was approved for COVID patients receiving certain steroids and who require supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or life support equipment extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

Roche Jr., former Inquirer investigative reporter, actor, and blogger, has died at 75","Mr. Roche was an actor as a young man and used his role-playing skills to put those he was interviewing as a reporter at ease. Read more Courtesy of the family

Walter F. Roche Jr., 75, of Lafayette Hill, a former investigative reporter for The Inquirer, Baltimore Sun, Los Angeles Times, Tennessean, and other media outlets as well as an actor and prolific blogger, died Friday, Nov. 25, of heart failure at Chestnut Hill Hospital.

Mr. Roche broke news and wrote compelling stories for The Inquirer from 1982 to 1996, working first as the Harrisburg bureau chief and later as one of the paper’s top investigative reporters. He composed countless stories about Pennsylvania and Philadelphia politics, and was perhaps best known for a 1988 series of articles he and colleague Gary Cohn wrote that resulted in the 1990 conviction of union leader Earl Stout for stealing more than $700,000 from the city’s largest municipal workers’ union.

He opened a 1990 story about Stout’s trial by writing: “Testifying in his own defense, former city union leader Earl Stout said yesterday that his union was getting a bargain when he hired a former Commonwealth Court judge as a $100,000-a-year legal consultant.”

As a reporter for the Sun from 1996 to 2004, Mr. Roche and colleague Scott Higham investigated Maryland State Sen. Larry Young, and their 1997 stories revealing financial and ethical misconduct resulted in Young’s 1998 expulsion from the state Senate. Baltimore City Paper named Mr. Roche that city’s best reporter in 2003.

“He was in a league of his own when it came to investigative reporting,” said William K. Marimow, former editor of The Inquirer and a colleague of Mr. Roche at both The Inquirer and Sun.

From 2004 until he retired in 2014, Mr. Roche wrote for the Washington bureau of the Los Angeles Times, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, and the Tennessean in Nashville. Earlier in his career, he was a reporter in Fitchburg, Mass., for the Telegraph and Gazette, and in Boston for United Press International and WBZ-TV.

Colleagues called him “indefatigable,” “dogged,” and “relentless” in his pursuit of a story, and labeled his investigations as “assiduous,” “meticulous,” and “classic.” They said he was a master of disguise, observation, surveillance, and in analyzing public records, and a “giant in our profession.”

Mr. Roche was known for questioning everything he was told and rummaging through trash bins for information, a process colleagues called his Document Recovery Program. He was especially proud of his coverage for the Tennessean of a deadly fungal meningitis outbreak in 2012.

He could be cantankerous, friends said, but his willingness to mentor young reporters was constant. “He loved good journalism and admired young journalists who aspired to excellence,” Marimow said.

His wife, Mary, a former reporter who met Mr. Roche when they worked together in Fitchburg, said: “He loved his job. He was very concerned with people, how they felt, and how they were being treated.” His daughter, Maura, said: “My dad taught me the importance of diligently looking for the facts, questioning authority, and speaking up for those not in a position to be widely heard.”

Quiet and unassuming as a rule, Mr. Roche became animated on stage, and he performed in plays and productions throughout his young life, and earned a bachelor’s degree in theater arts from Brandeis University in Massachusetts in 1969. Colleagues said his ability to mute his own personality, blend in with crowds, and make others feel comfortable around him was a key to his reporting success.

Since 2014, Mr. Roche was a prolific blogger, and his posts detail topics ranging from veterans affairs to health care to politics and other issues. “He was interested in mostly everything,” his wife said. “I couldn’t keep up with him. He was always looking into something.”

Born Oct. 12, 1947, in Fitchburg, Walter Francis Roche Jr. graduated from Cranwell Preparatory School in Lenox, Mass., and later earned a master’s degree in public administration from Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. He married Mary D’Amore in 1970, and they had daughter Maura and son Curtis, and lived in Lafayette Hill since 1990.

Mr. Roche had an amazing memory and was an avid reader, often poring over half a dozen newspapers a day. He enjoyed the theater, shared an endearing sense of humor, and spent hours on his computer doing research and writing.

“He was quietly kind and fiercely loyal,” his daughter said. His wife said: “He was a great guy, a kind person who wanted to give back.”

In addition to his wife and children, Mr. Roche is survived by one grandson, two brothers, two sisters, and other relatives.

This collaboration helps patients access critical resources and locate information about testing, available treatment options, high-risk factors that increase the chance of progressing to severe COVID-19, and ways to seek timely care.

The Pilot® COVID-19 At-Home Test will now include a QR code that directs individuals to covid19knowmore.com, a Pfizer website, to learn more about testing and treatment options.





Basel, 14 December 2022 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced it has entered into a U.S. focused collaboration with Pfizer to drive awareness and educate on the importance of timely COVID-19 testing, available treatment options, symptoms and the high-risk factors that can increase the chance of progressing to severe illness.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 9 out of 10 adults struggle to understand and use personal and public health information because it contains unfamiliar or complex terms. This collaboration aims to simplify and improve access to health information related to COVID-19. On covid19knowmore.com, a Pfizer website, individuals can learn why early testing is important at symptom onset, which health conditions increase the risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 and what treatment options are available.

Individuals who test positive, and are age 50 or older or have certain medical conditions - such as chronic lung disease, heart disease or a weakened immune system - or a sedentary lifestyle, are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19.

“Empowering patients to take appropriate action following a positive test result remains critical to reducing spread of the virus and lowering rates of severe infection,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO of Roche Diagnostics. “As we face another potential winter surge, we are proud to embark on this timely collaboration with Pfizer to improve COVID-19 health literacy among patients in the United States. This exciting initiative may serve as a foundation for future collaborations in many other countries worldwide.”

The Pilot COVID-19 At-Home Test,¹ distributed in the United States by Roche Diagnostics and manufactured by SD Biosensor Inc., will now include a QR code that directs individuals to covid19knowmore.com, where they can learn more about COVID-19, including CDC guidance on testing and treatment options.

“With high numbers of respiratory infections across the country, some of which put people at high-risk for severe illness, there is cause for concern that another surge in COVID-19 cases could dramatically affect the healthcare system as the winter months set in,” said Dr. Alejandro Cane, U.S. Vaccines and Antivirals Medical and Scientific Affairs Lead, Pfizer. “This collaboration provides patients who test positive for COVID-19 critical resources that can help them take action against COVID-19, if needed.”

The Pilot COVID-19 At-Home Test is an easy-to-use, accurate and reliable rapid antigen test that delivers results in as few as 20 minutes. It is authorized for the detection of COVID-19 with or without symptoms for individuals ages 14 years and older, and by an adult for children ages 2 to 13 years old.² It has been distributed to tens of millions of Americans through the U.S. government’s efforts to expand access to testing earlier this year. The Pilot COVID-19 At-Home Test is available for over-the-counter purchase through select retail channels in the U.S.

Accurate and timely diagnosis inform appropriate treatment decisions, and can help shorten the length of hospital stays and limit the spread of infections in healthcare settings.

Taking an at-home COVID-19 test is recommended by the CDC when individuals have any COVID-19 symptoms, were exposed to someone with COVID-19 or are going to an indoor event or gathering. If an individual tests negative, they are advised to conduct serial (or repeat) testing. Receiving multiple negative test results increases the confidence that an individual is not infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.

In March 2020, Roche became the first company to launch a commercial COVID-19 PCR test running on high-throughput laboratory instruments. The company has developed more than 20 COVID-19 tests and solutions globally, and sold more than 1.8 billion COVID-19 tests worldwide since the beginning of the pandemic. Roche offers high-quality solutions for every setting, from large reference laboratories to at-home testing. For more information, please visit www.roche.com.

About the Pilot COVID-19 At-Home Test

The Pilot COVID-19 At-Home Test is a lateral flow immunoassay for the qualitative detection of the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 present in anterior nasal swab samples. In a prospective clinical study, the Pilot COVID-19 At-Home Test showed a relative sensitivity of 93.2% (95% CI: 81.8 to 97.7 %) and a relative specificity of 100% (95% CI: 96.7 to 100%).³ Overall the studies included 168 symptomatic individuals (158 evaluable samples). This test is authorized for* individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 within the first six days of symptom onset when tested at least twice over three days with at least 48 hours between tests, and for individuals without symptoms or other epidemiological reasons to suspect COVID-19 when tested at least three times over five days with at least 48 hours between tests.

Variants, including omicron BA.1, BA.2 , BA.4 and BA.5, have been analyzed by SD Biosensor, and there is no expected impact on the performance of the test.4

https://www.roche.com/stories/united-voices-driving-change-in-cancer-care/,"United voices, driving change in cancer care","There have been many breakthrough advances in cancer care over the years - from sophisticated diagnostics to innovative therapies, immunotherapies and precision medicines. While these offer new hope for some, for many they remain out of reach. Closing this care gap is a shared responsibility, and we must unite and take action to address these challenges.

Receiving a cancer diagnosis can be frightening; navigating the complexities of treatment and the impact of the disease on a person’s life is a challenging and daunting prospect. Although there have been significant advances in recent years, for many people across the globe, the concerns of a cancer diagnosis are exacerbated by struggles to access the care they need. Today, many cancers can be prevented, treated, and even cured, but due to inequities that impact care, half of the world’s population lacks access to the full range of essential health services.1 Geography, socioeconomic status and gender, among many factors, can impact a person’s ability to obtain screening, diagnosis and treatment. This has a severe impact on care worldwide; for example - more than 90% of cervical cancer mortality occurs in low- and middle-income countries,2 and there are notable differences in cancer-related outcomes for rural and non-rural patients, even in high-income settings such as the US.3

Such inequities are unacceptable. Addressing this issue requires collaboration and united voices, confronting truths together to take action, to close the care gap. It also requires ensuring that people everywhere have access to the care they need and deserve. As part of the World Cancer Day initiative, the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) is drawing attention to this vital goal.







The UICC is the largest and oldest international cancer organisation, representing the world’s major cancer societies, ministries of health and patient groups. Each year since 2000, the initiative has aimed to spark conversations and provoke deeper dialogue on the most critical issues in cancer all around the world. This year, World Cancer Day is focused on ‘uniting our voices and taking action,’ to close the gap in access to cancer care.

Individual action, collective responsibility

At Roche, we share this vision; we are committed to closing the care gap and empowering those who work with us to do the same. Together, we are partnering with the global healthcare community to take action and bring us closer to the goal of advancing cancer care for all patients, everywhere. From diagnostics, where we are working with partners to improve access to advanced tests to provide faster and more accurate diagnoses, to research and development, where we are continuing to work with patients and the broader healthcare community to develop new treatments for rare cancers, we know that we all have a part to play.



Find out how we are working towards closing the care gap with unique contributions from across the world.

“Everyone deserves the cancer care they need, no matter who they are or where they live. This year for World Cancer Day, we at Roche are proud to be joining the global community, in uniting voices, to take action in closing the cancer care gap. We passionately believe in a better future of healthcare for all, and we are working towards this on World Cancer Day and every day.” Diana Edralin Roche General Manager, Philippines

Progress through partnerships

We know that we cannot close the care gap on our own. To truly improve outcomes for the millions of people who are diagnosed with cancer each year, we must collaborate. This means working together, from industry to governments to NGOs, calling on our individual expertise and shared drive to do better for patients everywhere. It also means listening to patients and the people closest to them, to understand the local context for truly tailored access solutions: we know that barriers to access can be incredibly varied, and we cannot settle for a one-size-fits-all approach to addressing them. Only through partnering to improve access at a local scale can we drive change to improve access globally.

WHO (World Health Organization) projected a shortfall of 10 million health workers by 2030, mostly in low- and lower-middle income countries.4 Through partnering with Project ECHO, we are supporting the training and mentoring of healthcare personnel in rural and underserved areas in India, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines and Canada, enabling the faster diagnosis and treatment of the patients they serve.

Across Asia, we are collaborating through Mission Leapfrog to improve access to healthcare. We are working with partners throughout the healthcare system to tackle complex issues and improve outcomes for those impacted by gaps in access.

We are also partnering to improve access on a country-specific scale, such as through the National Health Insurance Authority Act in Nigeria, which provides access to funding for medication, chemotherapy and radiotherapy services for people with breast, cervical and prostate cancers. In Kenya, the EMPOWER program is setting up clinics across the country, helping women in remote areas access screening and treatment, and through our partnership with the National Health Insurance Fund, we are helping to provide free breast cancer drugs to women who need them. Women like Frankline, whose life was saved by the initiative after her diagnosis. Find out more about her journey by watching this short film.

Early diagnosis and screening save lives

When diagnosed in the earliest stage, 9 in 10 women with ovarian cancer will survive their disease for more than five years. When diagnosed in the advanced stage, this drops to 1 in 10 women.5 Such figures are similar across many types of the disease, and show why cancer care is more than just treating a person once they are diagnosed; it goes beyond improving access to treatments. We must ensure that people are able to access screening and testing at an early stage. We are working to make this a reality, because we know that for a person with cancer, screening and early diagnosis can mean the difference between life and death. We recently partnered with the Johns Hopkins Program for International Education in Gynecology and Obstetrics (Jhpiego) to improve women’s health outcomes by removing barriers to early detection and treatment.

The company today said it had discontinued the asset in IPF after the pivotal Starscape trial was stopped for futility, incurring a $400m write-off against the asset's acquired value. The next big hope in the disease is Fibrogen’s pamrevlumab, with the first late-stage data due this year. Since the last time Evaluate Vantage carried out this analysis, Boehringer has taken BI 1015550 into phase 3 following promising mid-stage data, while Pliant posted a phase 2a win; both projects have been linked with improvements in forced vital capacity, a measure of lung function. Roche did not show an increase in FVC in its phase 2 trial of zinpentraxin, but merely demonstrated slightly less decline than with placebo. The phase 2 study of pamrevlumab tells a similar story, which might not bode well for Fibrogen. Still, plenty of others are vying for this space, with a crowded mid-stage pipeline. Recent entrants include autotaxin inhibitors from Blade and Bridge Biotherapeutics, cudetaxestat and BBT-877 respectively; Boehringer returned rights to the latter amid toxicity concerns, however.

https://www.biopharma-reporter.com/Article/2023/02/07/Roche-announces-positive-Phase-3-data-for-crovalimab-in-PNH,Roche announces positive Phase 3 data for crovalimab in PNH,"If approved by regulators, crovalimab could take on AstraZeneca’s blockbuster drug Soliris (eculizumab): which was the first drug approved by the FDA and EMA to treat PNH and is currently used in nearly 50 countries. The drug, acquired via the takeover of Alexion, boasted $1.9bn in revenue in 2021 across all indications.

Now, the new Roche data shows that crovalimab could be given as an injection every four weeks, compared to every two weeks for eculizumab.

Phase 3 data

The Phase 3 Commodore 2 study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of crovalimab in people with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) who have not been previously treated with complement inhibitors.

Announcing the new data this morning, Roche says the study met met its co-primary efficacy endpoints of transfusion avoidance and control of hemolysis (the ongoing destruction of red blood cells measured by lactate dehydrogenase levels).

Results showed that crovalimab, a novel, investigational anti-C5 recycling monoclonal antibody, given as a subcutaneous injection every four weeks, ‘achieved disease control and was non-inferior to eculizumab, a current standard of care’, which is given intravenously every two weeks.

Meanwhile, a separate Phase III study, entitled Commodore 1, has presented efficacy and safety data in people with PNH switching from currently approved C5 inhibitors to crovalimab: with this data supporting the 'favorable benefit-risk profile of crovalimab, as seen in the pivotal Commodore 2 study'.

“People with PNH may benefit from more options to achieve robust disease control with less frequent treatment intervals,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development.

“As the first global phase III data for crovalimab, these results emphasise its potential to address these needs. We look forward to submitting these data to regulatory authorities, bringing us one step closer to making crovalimab available for people with PNH around the world.”

Data from both studies will be submitted to regulatory authorities around the world and presented at an upcoming medical meeting, added Garraway.

PNH treatment

PNH is a rare and life-threatening blood condition in which red blood cells are destroyed by the complement system. This causes symptoms such as anemia, fatigue, blood clots and kidney disease.

C5 inhibitors can be effective in treating the condition. Crovalimab has been engineered to be recycled within the circulation, enabling sustained complement inhibition through low-dose, subcutaneous administration every four weeks.

In addition, it binds to a different C5 binding site from current treatments, which has the potential to provide an effective treatment option for people with specific C5 gene mutations, who do not respond to current therapies.

Crovalimab is being investigated in five ongoing Phase III studies: including atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, sickle cell disease and other complement-mediated diseases.

In December, Roche announced that the Phase 3 Commodore 3 study, undertaken in China, was efficacious in PNH, meeting the co-primary endpoints of transfusion avoidance and haemolysis control. Data from this study has been submitted as part of a drug application to China’s National Medical Products Administration under priority review.",['Rachel Arthur'],2023-02-07 00:00:00

The XBB.1.5 Omicron sub-variant is prevalent in the U.S. and quickly spreads to other countries.

Being able to differentiate emerging variants and understand their similarities and mutations provides a basis for experts to make predictions about their spread and respond with appropriate treatment strategies.

""Roche continues to develop timely diagnostic innovations related to COVID-19 by providing valuable insights - helping scientists and physicians understand this new strain, how it differs from other variants, and the impact it may have on public health,"" said Matt Sause, CEO of Roche Diagnostics.

The research-use-only test, VirSNiP SARS-CoV-2 Spike F486P, adds to the broad suite of COVID-19 test kits developed by Roche and TIB Molbiol.

Roche's Q3 FY22 sales reached CHF14.74 billion, down 6% Y/Y due to lower sales from COVID-19 treatments and diagnostics.

""The third quarter of 2022 was particularly challenging due to base effects, as the demand for COVID-19 medicines and tests was exceptionally high in the same quarter of 2021,"" the company said.

""Despite an increasing incidence rate for COVID-19, actually, we don't see an increase in the demand for COVID-19-related products,"" CEO Severin Schwan said.

Sonnet will sponsor the clinical study in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, scheduled to commence during the second calendar quarter of 2023, and Roche will supply atezolizumab

PRINCETON, NJ / ACCESSWIRE / January 9, 2023 / Sonnet BioTherapeutics Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SONN), a clinical-stage company developing targeted immunotherapeutic drugs, announced today a clinical collaboration agreement with Roche. A clinical trial (SB221) will be conducted to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of SON-1010 (IL12-F H AB) in combination with Roche's atezolizumab in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC). Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a cytokine, or an immune cell-signaling protein, that enhances the activity of natural killer (NK) cells and T cells. SON-1010 is a proprietary version of native human IL-12, configured using Sonnet's fully human albumin binding (F H AB®) platform, which targets the tumor microenvironment (TME) and extends the pharmacokinetics (PK) and subsequent pharmacodynamics (PD) of the molecule. Atezolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor approved for the treatment of some of the most aggressive and difficult-to-treat forms of cancer. The characteristics of ovarian cancer present a unique opportunity to assess the combination of these two agents in an indication that persists as a large unmet medical need.

""As this is Sonnet's first combination clinical study and an opportunity to use our lead F H AB-derived candidate, SON-1010, with atezolizumab, it is a very important milestone for the company. We believe that the combination of our best-in-class IL12-F H AB immune-enhancer candidate with atezolizumab could enable the next generation of cancer treatment."" said Pankaj Mohan, Ph.D., Sonnet's Founder and Chief Executive Officer. ""We anticipate initiating the clinical study during the second calendar quarter of 2023 and will look to a successful safety evaluation for the opportunity to expand the collaboration"".

Story continues

Sonnet and Roche have entered into a Master Clinical Trial and Supply Agreement (MCSA), along with ancillary Quality and Safety Agreements, to study the safety and efficacy of the combination of SON-1010 and atezolizumab in a platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) patient setting. Further, the companies would provide SON-1010 and atezolizumab, respectively, for use in the Phase 1b/Phase 2a safety and efficacy study.

""The extended PK of SON-1010, along with its ability to target and be retained within the TME, makes it a potentially best-in-class version of IL-12"", said Richard Kenney, M.D., Sonnet's Chief Medical Officer. ""Ovarian cancer has a high expression of proteins that bind albumin, which will concentrate SON-1010 in the TME. The induced immune responses can make this relatively ‘cold' tumor immunologically ‘hot'. Ovarian cancer patients who are resistant to platinum compounds have very few options for successful treatment. This combination provides a novel alternative that may improve their rate of response.""

SB221 is a global Phase 1b/2a multicenter, dose-escalation and randomized proof-of-concept study to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and efficacy of SON-1010 administered subcutaneously (SC), either alone or in combination with atezolizumab given intravenously (IV). The study is designed in Part 1 to rapidly establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination in patients with advanced solid tumors in small dose-escalation groups and to expand the dataset at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). This would be followed in Part 2 by an assessment in patients with PROC of the potential for improved efficacy of the combination over SON-1010 alone or the standard of care. Both companies look forward to this collaboration as an opportunity to improve outcomes for patients with ovarian cancer.

https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-approves-roches-lymphoma-therapy-2022-12-23/,U.S. FDA approves Roche's lymphoma therapy,"













Dec 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. health regulator has approved Roche Holding AG's (ROG.S) therapy for treating a type of rare cancer called follicular lymphoma.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval for Lunsumio was based on an early-to mid-stage study that showed the drug cleared signs of cancer in patients, with most patients responding to the treatment for at least 18 months, the company said late Thursday.

The drug, which will be available in the United States in the coming weeks, is expected to cost nearly $180,000 for a fixed course of eight cycles of treatment, the company told Reuters.

Follicular lymphoma is a slow-growing type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer that starts in body's white blood cells called lymphocytes.

The disease often relapses after the initial therapy and typically becomes harder to treat each time it relapses in a patient. In the United States, about 13,000 new cases of rare cancer are estimated to be diagnosed in 2022, according to the company.

The drug, known chemically as mosunetuzumab, can be administered at a hospital's outpatient center, unlike some other follicular lymphoma drugs that require extended hospital stays.

Roche's drug would compete with follicular lymphoma therapies from rivals like German drugmaker Bayer AG's (BAYGn.DE) Aliqopa, Novartis AG's (NOVN.S) Kymriah, and Gilead Sciences' (GILD.O) Yescarta.

Xofluza is the first influenza antiviral with a new mechanism of action in almost 20 years, stopping viral replication faster than oseltamivir

Single-dose Xofluza helps reduce the societal burden of influenza by helping patients recover quickly and by preventing infection in individuals following contact with someone with the virus





Basel, 12 January 2023 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Xofluza® (baloxavir marboxil) in children aged one year and above for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza and for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza. Post-exposure prophylaxis aims to prevent influenza in individuals following contact with someone infected with the influenza virus. The Commission’s Decision is based on the results of the phase III miniSTONE-2 and BLOCKSTONE studies.1,2 This approval marks the first single-dose, oral influenza medicine approved in Europe for children, and now means that Xofluza can be used to treat and prevent uncomplicated influenza in children aged one year and above, and in adolescents and adults.3

“We are delighted that the European Commission has approved Xofluza for children aged one year and above, as influenza can be particularly dangerous for younger children,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are hopeful that Xofluza’s convenient single-dose oral regimen will help children recover quickly, as well as reduce the societal burden of influenza.”

Influenza is a serious infectious disease and represents a significant threat to public health.4-6 Rates of influenza in Europe are rising and it is expected that the virus will infect around one in four children each year.6,7 In addition to being at higher risk of infection, children also play a significant role in the spread of influenza from one person to another.6,8 In studies of influenza transmission in households, the risk of infection from others in the household was as high as 38%.9 Prophylactic treatment with Xofluza, which stops viral replication faster than oseltamivir, may help to limit the spread of influenza and therefore reduce the impact and burden of influenza on society.2,10,11

The approval is based on the results of the phase III miniSTONE-2 and BLOCKSTONE studies.1,2 The miniSTONE-2 study met its primary endpoint of safety and showed that Xofluza reduced the length of time that influenza was released from the body by more than two days compared with oseltamivir (viral replication; median time of 24.2 hours versus 75.8 hours, respectively). Xofluza was well tolerated with no new safety signals identified.1

In the BLOCKSTONE study Xofluza showed a statistically significant prophylactic effect after a single oral dose, by reducing the risk of people developing influenza after exposure to an infected household member by 86% versus placebo (1.9% in participants treated with Xofluza and 13.6% in the placebo group).2

Xofluza was first approved for use in Europe in 2021 for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza and for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and above.12 Xofluza is now approved in more than 70 countries for the treatment of influenza types A and B.13 Roche is continuing to investigate Xofluza in phase III trials in children under the age of one (NCT03653364), as well as to assess its potential to reduce transmission of influenza from an infected person to household members (NCT03969212).14,15

About miniSTONE-21

miniSTONE-2 was a phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study that evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of a single-dose of Xofluza® (baloxavir marboxil) compared with oseltamivir in otherwise healthy children aged one to less than 12 years with influenza infection and displaying influenza symptoms for no more than 48 hours (temperature of 38°C or over, and one or more respiratory symptoms).

Participants enrolled in the study were recruited in parallel into two cohorts: children aged five to less than 12 years and children aged one to less than five years. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a single-dose of Xofluza or oseltamivir twice a day over five days (dosing according to body weight).

Time to alleviation of influenza signs and symptoms were comparable between Xofluza and oseltamivir. The median time to alleviation of signs and symptoms in influenza-infected participants was 138 hours (95% CI: 117, 163) and 150 hours (95% CI: 115, 166) for those who received Xofluza or oseltamivir, respectively. Xofluza reduced the length of time that influenza was released from the body by more than two days compared with oseltamivir (viral replication; median time of 24.2 hours versus 75.8 hours, respectively). Xofluza was well tolerated with no new safety signals identified.

About BLOCKSTONE2

BLOCKSTONE was a phase III, double-blind, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, post-exposure prophylaxis study that evaluated single-dose Xofluza® (baloxavir marboxil) compared with placebo in household members (adults and children), who were living with someone with influenza, confirmed by a rapid influenza diagnostic test (the ‘index patient’).

Participants enrolled in the study were household members of someone who had been diagnosed with influenza. The participants were randomised to receive a single-dose of Xofluza (dose according to body weight) or placebo as a preventive measure against developing influenza.

Xofluza showed a statistically significant prophylactic effect after a single oral dose, by reducing the risk of people developing influenza after exposure to an infected household member by 86% versus placebo. The proportion of households, who developed laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was 1.9% in participants treated with Xofluza and 13.6% in the placebo-treated group.

Xofluza was well tolerated in this study and no new safety signals were identified. The study was conducted in Japan by Shionogi & Co., Ltd.

About Xofluza® (baloxavir marboxil)

Xofluza is a first-in-class, single-dose oral medicine with an innovative mechanism of action that has demonstrated efficacy in a wide range of influenza viruses, including in vitro activity against oseltamivir-resistant strains and avian strains (H7N9, H5N1) in non-clinical studies.10,16,17 Xofluza is the first in a class of antivirals designed to inhibit the cap-dependent endonuclease protein, which is essential for viral replication.10

Xofluza is approved in more than 70 countries for the treatment of influenza types A and B. In Europe, Xofluza is now approved for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza and for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in children aged one year and above, and in adolescents and adults. Xofluza is the first innovation in mechanism of action for an influenza antiviral approved by the European Commission in almost 20 years.18

Robust clinical evidence has demonstrated the benefit of Xofluza in several populations (otherwise-healthy, high-risk, children and post-exposure prophylaxis in individuals aged one year and above).1,2,10,19 Xofluza is being further studied in a phase III development programme, including in children under the age of one (NCT03653364) as well as to assess its potential to reduce transmission of influenza from an infected person to healthy people (NCT03969212).14,15

Xofluza was discovered by Shionogi & Co., Ltd. and is being further developed and commercialised globally in collaboration with the Roche Group (which includes Genentech in the US) and Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Under the terms of this agreement, Roche holds worldwide rights to Xofluza excluding Japan and Taiwan, which will be retained exclusively by Shionogi & Co., Ltd.

About Roche in influenza

Influenza is a serious infectious disease and represents a significant threat to public health. Seasonal epidemics result in three to five million cases of severe disease, millions of hospitalisations and up to 650,000 deaths globally every year.4 Roche has a long heritage in developing medicines that contribute to public health. We are committed to bringing innovation in the field of infectious diseases, including influenza. Tamiflu® (oseltamivir) has made a significant difference both to the treatment of seasonal influenza as well as in the management of recent pandemics, and we are proud to have brought this innovative medicine to patients. Although vaccines are an important first line of defence in preventing influenza, there is a need for new medical options for prevention (prophylaxis) and treatment. Roche is committed to addressing the unmet need in this area through its agreement with Shionogi & Co., Ltd. to develop and commercialise Xofluza® (baloxavir marboxil).

Roche's Tecentriq (atezolizumab) combined with Avastin (bevacizumab) met the primary efficacy endpoint in early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the Phase III IMbrave050 study, the company announced Thursday.

In a statement, Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., CMO and head of global product development at Roche, said IMbrave050 is the “first Phase III study to show that a cancer immunotherapy combination reduced the risk of disease returning” in patients with early-stage HCC.

In this patient population, over 70% of patients eventually see cancer recurrence following surgery, which in turn leads to worse prognoses and shorter survival, Garraway added.

In the study’s intention-to-treat population, patients treated with the drug combo, developed by Roche subsidiary Genentech, showed significantly better recurrence-free survival than those assigned to active surveillance. Overall survival data were immature at the time of the pre-specified analysis and patient follow-up will continue until the next analysis.

The study enrolled more than 660 patients with early-stage HCC deemed to be at high risk of recurrence after surgical resection or curative ablation.

Aside from key efficacy measures, IMbrave050 also evaluated the safety profile of the drug combo which, by the time of the pre-specified analysis, was consistent with what had previously been established.

Roche is preparing to submit data from IMbrave050 to health regulatory authorities including the FDA and European Medicines Agency.

HCC Space Heating Up

Thursday’s promising Phase III performance is the latest HCC win for Tecentriq and Avastin. According to data from the IMbrave150 study, the drug combo is the first treatment option in over a decade to confer significant overall survival benefit over standard of care in unresectable HCC.

Joining Roche in the HCC space is AstraZeneca, whose own drug combo of Imjudo (tremelimumab) and Imfinzi (durvalumab) recieved FDA approval in unresectable HCC last October 2022.

Data from the Phase III HIMALAYA trial, the basis for the regulatory nod, showed that one priming dose of the combination treatment cut the risk of death by 22% compared with Bayer’s Nexavar (sorafenib).

Novartis, along with Chinese collaborator BeiGene, is also a dominant presence in the HCC space. Last August 2022, the partners reported that investigational antibody tislelizumab hit its primary efficacy endpoint in the Phase III RATIONALE 301 trial, demonstrating non-inferior overall survival to Nexavar. Tislelizumab is being trialed for unresectable HCC.",[],
https://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/roches-gamble-and-the-vatican-law-of-power,Roche’s gamble — and the Vatican law of power,"In the years since Pope Francis promulgated Traditionis custodes, it has fallen to Cardinal Arthur Roche, prefect of the Vatican’s liturgy office, to interpret the pope’s policy, and to engage with the diocesan bishops tasked with implementing the policy in their local churches.

As the Dicastery for Divine Worship oversees that process, Roche has been criticized for an approach that seemed to arrogate authority to his office, in excess of what was actually given to it in Traditionis custodes, or in the 2022 reorganization of the Roman Curia, for that matter.

In the Church’s canon law, governing authority ordinarily stems from ecclesiastical office — from a specifically delineated set of prerogatives and obligations which come by official appointment to a particular function.

But while Roche has faced criticism in recent months, he’s also demonstrated a keen insight for the way things sometimes work in the Church; whatever the canon law says, governing authority - or at least real practical power - is sometimes gained by those who act like they have it, and convince others of the same. Decrees are important, to be sure, but in the administrative life of the Church, perception is sometimes more powerful than a decree.

“Power resides,” quoth George RR Martin, “where men believe it resides.”

Leave a comment

In the years since Traditionis custodes was promulgated, Roche has seemed to some Vatican-watchers to gamble, one roll of the dice at a time, on the notion that as long as the Dicastery for Divine Worship is aiming for a robust interpretation of the pope’s liturgical reform, it can also centralize liturgical authority to itself, far beyond the dictates of canon law, and with very little resistance or correction.

The cardinal took a big gamble in December 2021, when his office asserted a set of apparently normative interpretations of the pope’s liturgical policies, and reserved to itself some powers which had seemed in the actual text of Traditionis custodes to belong to diocesan bishops.

And in recent months, Roche has made another gamble — telling at least some U.S. bishops that they do not have the authority to dispense from certain provisions of Traditionis custodes, even while - to the mind of many canonists - the papal text itself does not support that claim.

Sources confirmed to The Pillar this week that one California diocese had been recently informed that diocesan bishops are not allowed to dispense from Traditionis custodes’ prohibition against permitting the Extraordinary Form of the Mass in parish churches.

In a letter to at least a few U.S. bishops, the Dicastery for Divine Worship noted that while diocesan bishops are generally permitted to dispense from universal disciplinary laws, they can not dispense from such norms if their dispensation is reserved to the Holy See. That, of course, is the policy established in canon 87 of the Code of Canon Law.

But the dicastery then made a claim which has canon lawyers scratching their heads — namely that all provisions of Traditionis custodes are reserved to the Holy See, and that diocesan bishops, therefore, have no dispensing power over its norms.

The problem is that, on its face, Traditionis custodes does not actually claim that dispensations from its norms are reserved to the Holy See. Canon law says that laws which restrict the rights of bishops must be delineated explicitly, and the papal motu proprio does not address the prospect of dispensations at all.

Roche’s letter on the subject cited a provision of the motu proprio which designated the dicastery to exercise oversight over Traditionis — but that provision made no mention of reserved dispensations.

And since Traditionis custodes did explicitly mention required consultation with the Vatican on some issues, many canonists argue, it might well have mentioned reserved dispensations just as easily. But since it didn't, the dicastery has now made a retroactive claim to a kind of implicit reservation – an unusual canonical situation, to say the least.

Start your day with Starting Seven - a daily news roundup in your inbox.

For many canonists, again, the issue seems clear — the law itself requires that Vatican restrictions on a bishop’s governing authority be stated explicitly, and Traditionis does not contain the restrictions that Roche has claimed.

On the one hand, this might suggest simply that the cardinal is out over his skis — that the motu proprio was formulated hastily, and that Roche’s dicastery is trying to implement the pope’s vision despite the actual wording of the text.

And complaints about the dicastery’s approach to legal interpretation might well seem like the persnickety whining of “doctors of the law” — the pontiff obviously wants his motu proprio implemented, and Roche is obviously aiming to curtail bishops looking for ways to soften the policy’s impact.

But many canonists have suggested the issue is much more significant than a quarrel over dispensations.

Some argue that it is a violation of natural justice for the Holy See to promulgate laws, and then interpret them in ways that defy their plain meaning.

And unchecked violations of natural justice, some canonists say, inevitably lead to social breakdown.

But however much canonists fulminate, Roche’s gamble seems to be paying off in the short term. The Pillar has confirmed that bishops who received Roche’s correction on dispensations - however much outside the law it is - are mostly complying with it, albeit perhaps begrudgingly.

While a recourse to the Church’s Apostolic Signatura is possible, no bishop has yet said he intends to make one.

And thus power presumed became power assumed.

For the Church, of course, the consequence of that kind of approach to legal authority is to degrade the rule of law across the whole ecclesial society – to undermine confidence that, when push comes to shove, canon law will be anything more than a set of suggestions, or worse, a set of norms manipulated to say what they plainly don’t, for the sake of those who understand how to use them.

When the rule of law gives way to the law of power, in any society, social dysfunction follows, as local leaders lose the confidence to act on their own authority — lest they be told they don’t actually have it.

Leave a comment

But whatever the consequences, will Roche succeed in assuming more authority for his dicastery than it actually has?

To date, he’s already been successful - whether with the tacit consent of the pope, or without his knowledge.

If he wanted to, Francis, could, of course, modify the law to allow Roche the kind of authority he seems to be claiming — or the pontiff could have actually structured his motu proprio in the way Roche reads it.

But the pope, while an inveterate legislator, has not shown much interest in questions about legal theory in the life of the Church, or their impact on social function — and thus it is not clear whether he has explicitly supported the Dicastery for Divine Worship’s approach to implementing Traditionis custodes.

Still, eventually Roche may reach the end of the road — if diocesan bishops raise to the pontiff the problems they experience with the dicastery’s approach to legal interpretation, the pope may decide he’s sympathetic to them, as he sometimes does after personal audiences. Or the pontiff may decide he's had enough, and that clipping Roche’s wings is a good enough way to keep the peace.

In the meantime, though, Roche’s continuing approach indicates that while Francis has urged that curial reform be rooted in a respect for just procedures and policies, some of his prefects seem more concerned for the outcome of their work than for the way it is conducted.

How long will diocesan bishops find that situation tenable?

That, of course, remains to be seen.",[],2023-02-10 16:49:02+00:00

HOOKIPA to receive $25 million in upfront cash as well as potential future success-based milestone payments up to approximately $930 million for both programs, plus tiered royalties

NEW YORK and VIENNA, Oct. 20, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HOOKIPA Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: HOOK, ‘HOOKIPA’), a company developing a new class of immunotherapies based on its proprietary arenavirus platform, announced today a strategic collaboration and license agreement with Roche to develop HB-700 for KRAS-mutated cancers and a second undisclosed novel arenaviral immunotherapy. This represents HOOKIPA’s first oncology licensing collaboration.



Through the collaboration, HOOKIPA will conduct research and early clinical development through Phase 1b for HB-700, a novel investigational arenaviral immunotherapy for the treatment of KRAS-mutated cancers. Upon the completion of the Phase 1b trial, Roche has the right to assume development responsibility and to commercialize licensed products across multiple indications upon approval. The agreement also includes an option for Roche to license a second arenaviral cancer immunotherapy.

“Roche is an ideal partner, both in terms of development and reaching patients with novel cancer therapeutics. We look forward to working with them to benefit people with KRAS-mutated cancers,” said Joern Aldag, Chief Executive Officer at HOOKIPA. “This collaboration validates the potential of our arenavirus platform and accelerates the development pathway to bring new treatments to people with cancer.”

“We are excited to collaborate with HOOKIPA in leveraging their arenaviral technology, which has clinically demonstrated the ability to induce potent antigen specific CD8+ T cell responses and represents a promising approach for new cancer immunotherapies,” said James Sabry, Global Head of Pharma Partnering at Roche. “This collaboration further strengthens our leadership in oncology, and we are optimistic about advancing this innovative platform to potentially provide more options for people with KRAS-mutated cancers, as well as other potential cancer types.”

Under the terms of the agreement, HOOKIPA will receive an upfront payment of $25 million. Roche will have the option to expand the initial collaboration by adding an additional product candidate, whereafter HOOKIPA will receive an additional $15 million payment at option exercise. Including this option payment, HOOKIPA is eligible for research, development and commercialization milestone-based payments for HB-700 and the additional product candidate totaling up to approximately $930 million. Upon commercialization, HOOKIPA is eligible to receive tiered royalties of a high single-digit to mid-teens percentage on the worldwide net sales of HB-700 and the additional product candidate.

About KRAS-mutated cancers

KRAS is a gene that acts as an on/off switch for cell growth. When there is a mutation, or error, in the gene, cells can grow out of control. KRAS mutations are among the most common mutations that cause cancer. While KRAS-mutated, tumor-specific treatments exist, there remains an opportunity to target a broader range of KRAS-mutations simultaneously to potentially help more people impacted by these cancers.

About HOOKIPA’s Arenaviral Technology

HOOKIPA’s novel, replicating arenaviral technology has demonstrated the ability to induce potent antigen-specific T cell responses and promising anti-tumor activity in a Phase 1 clinical trial which treated patients with advanced Human Papillomavirus 16-positive head and neck cancers. Preclinical studies have also demonstrated the ability of arenaviral immunotherapies to break self-tolerance and induce potent T cell responses to tumor self-antigens and mutated epitopes, or target parts of a mutated, cancer-causing gene. These findings provide scientific rationale for the HB-700 program.

About HB-700

HB-700 is an investigational arenaviral immunotherapy designed to treat KRAS-mutated lung, colorectal, pancreatic and other cancers. HB-700 is a replicating 2-vector therapy that targets the most common KRAS mutations: (G12D, G12V, G12R, G12C and G13D) and thereby benefits more patients than single mutation inhibitors.

About HOOKIPA

HOOKIPA Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: HOOK) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel immunotherapies, based on its proprietary arenavirus platform, which are designed to mobilize and amplify targeted T cells and thereby fight or prevent serious disease. HOOKIPA’s replicating and non-replicating technologies are engineered to induce robust and durable antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses and pathogen-neutralizing antibodies. HOOKIPA’s pipeline includes its wholly owned investigational arenaviral immunotherapies targeting Human Papillomavirus 16-positive cancers, prostate cancers, and other undisclosed programs. HOOKIPA is collaborating with Roche on an arenaviral immunotherapeutic for KRAS-mutated cancers. In addition, HOOKIPA aims to develop functional cures of HBV and HIV in collaboration with Gilead.

After the flurry of verdicts and meetings at the end of February, the FDA has a relatively quiet week ahead with only two stand-out events.

Roche Pushes Polivy into the Frontline

On March 9, the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee will convene to discuss Genentech’s supplemental Biologics License Application for Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin-piiq), the biotech’s anti-CD79b antibody-drug conjugate. Genentech is a Roche company.

Genentech is proposing to use Polivy, in combination with the R-CHP regimen, to treat patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who have not received prior lines of treatment.

To support its first-line bid, Genentech offered data from the Phase III POLARIX trial, which it submitted along with the sBLA in August 2022. The study showed Polivy plus plus R-CHP cut the risk of disease progression, relapse or death by 27% as compared with the R-CHOP regimen, the current standard of care in DLBCL.

Polivy plus R-CHP had a similar safety profile as R-CHOP.

With these results, POLARIX became the first study in 20 years to demonstrate a clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival over standard of care, Genentech reported. The FDA is expected to reach a formal verdict on Polivy’s sBLA by April 2, 2023.

In 2019, The FDA greenlit Polivy for the treatment of DLBCL that had progressed or returned after at least two prior lines of therapy.

Acadia Readies for Landmark Rett Ruling

Acadia Pharmaceuticals is hoping to notch an approval for its Rett syndrome candidate trofinetide, which has an FDA action date of March 12. Acadia is developing trofinetide in partnership with Neuren Pharmaceuticals.

If approved, trofinetide would be the first drug for Rett syndrome, an ultra-rare, multisystem neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental regression, loss of language and hand function, and impaired gait. It primarily affects female children.

Trofinetide is an investigational and novel synthetic analog of the amino‐terminal tripeptide domain of the IGF-1 protein. It works by preventing the overactivation of microglia and astrocytes, promoting synaptic function and reducing neuroinflammation.

Acadia submitted the New Drug Application for trofinetide in September 2022 and backed it up with data from the Phase III Lavender study, which compared the candidate against placebo in 187 girls and young women.

The co-primary endpoints – change in Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire scores from baseline and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale score – were significantly improved after trofinetide treatment, as compared with placebo. Lavender also hit key secondary endpoints.

The FDA granted trofinetide priority review, Fast Track Status, Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease designations.

This will be the second decision for the FDA’s Office of Neuroscience following the abrupt departure of its former head, Billy Dunn.",[],

Companies Roche Holding AG Follow















July 21 (Reuters) - Roche's (ROG.S) head of diagnostics, Thomas Schinecker, is to take over as group chief executive next year, replacing Severin Schwan, who will become chairman after rejuvenating the Swiss drugmaker's suite of treatments.

Chairman Christoph Franz will not seek re-election after nine years as non-executive board chairman at the next annual shareholder meeting in March 2023, the Swiss drugmaker said in a statement on Thursday.

Austrian-born Schwan, who became CEO in 2008, oversaw a strong share price performance as Roche diversified away from its traditional focus on cancer, offsetting revenue loss due to cheap biotech copies of established oncology medicines Herceptin, Avastin and Rituxan that once accounted for about half of drug sales.

The long-term share gains allowed him to secure a milestone deal last year with rival Novartis, which sold its nearly one-third voting stake in Roche back to its cross-town rival for $20.7 billion, entrenching the dominant role of the Roche family shareholders.

Schwan, one of Europe's best-paid corporate executives, said the changeover has long been in the making under the controlling families' supervision and it was a result of ""long term planning and the continuity, which certainly also reflects our capital structure"".

In a separate release, Roche said first-half adjusted operating income rose a better-than-expected 9% on higher sales of diagnostic tests and pharmaceuticals.

Core operating income, which is adjusted for one-off effects, gained 9% to 12.67 billion Swiss francs ($13.07 billion), above market consensus of 12.1 billion francs.

In a sign of oncology gradually taking a lesser role, haemophilia treatment Hemlibra and multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus continued to drive growth.

Under Schinecker's leadership, the diagnostics business met a surge in demand for COVID-19 test kits during the pandemic, which has been easing during the second quarter.

His promotion is a reflection of a ""fantastic, outstanding track record"" during this phase, Schwan told journalists in a call, adding that it did not mean a strategic rerating of the Swiss group's two business pillars, drugs and diagnostics was on the cards.

Roche reaffirmed that sales of COVID-19 medicines and diagnostics would decrease by about 2 billion Swiss francs this year to around 5 billion francs, even as new coronavirus subvariants fuel a resurgence in infections.

A World Health Organization official warned this week that Europeans must accelerate vaccine uptake and bring back mask wearing. read more

The guidance reflected a cautious stance amid great uncertainty, said Schwan, but he encouraged ""the financial community to model different scenarios"".

Schinecker will likely fight an uphill battle to further boost drug development because a key cancer drug candidate tiragolumab in May failed to meaningfully slow disease progression in patients with the most common form of lung cancer. read more

Late stage trial results on drug development venture gantenerumab against Alzheimer's disease will be keenly followed by investors, but Roche's leadership has sought to curb expectations for the read-out, due later this year.

https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/crypto-leaks-risks-roche-freedman-losing-more-class-action-work,Crypto Leaks Risks Roche Freedman Losing More Class Action Work,"An upstart litigation boutique that has made a name for itself by taking on crypto firms is on the ropes and at risk of losing its status as counsel in class actions.

Roche Freedman faces the repercussions after a website called Crypto Leaks released recordings of founding partner Kyle Roche boasting of his relationship with blockchain startup Ava Labs and voicing an apparent strategy to target the company’s competitors.

The law firm has faced disqualification motions in at least five cases, four of which are class actions brought by the firm, according to court filings. A judge on Oct. 13 removed the firm as interim lead counsel in a class action that accuses the crypto exchange Bitfinex and Tether of market manipulation.

Ava Labs, meanwhile, is transitioning away from using Roche Freedman as outside counsel, said a person from the company familiar with the matter and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Disqualification is a harsh remedy for courts to employ because people generally “shouldn’t be denied their choice of counsel,” said Jan Jacobowitz, a University of Miami law professor. “But it doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be employed on the right set of facts.”

Launched in 2019 by expats of Boies Schiller, Roche Freedman has been among the most active firms in the cryptocurrency litigation space. In addition to the Bitfinex/Tether market manipulation case, the firm represented plaintiffs in a matter that resulted in a jury ordering self-professed bitcoin inventor Craig Wright to pay $100 million in damages for cheating a deceased friend over crypto intellectual property.

The case is now on appeal in the Eleventh Circuit. Wright’s counsel is among the parties pushing for the Roche Freedman law firm to be removed.

Crypto Leaks

Roche has said the recordings stem from meetings he had in London in January 2022 with what he originally thought were potential investors in a business venture. In an affidavit submitted in court in September, he claimed a defendant in an action the firm is opposing was behind a scheme to obtain compromising recordings of him. He did not name the defendant.

It remains unclear who is behind the Crypto Leaks website, which launched this summer and only has published three posts. But the response to recordings of Roche has been swift.

District Judge Katherine Polk Failla on Oct. 13, in removing Roche Freedman from the Bitfinex/Tether case, said “it is too easy to say Mr. Roche was drunk and stupid.” She added, “His statements were coherent and logical and too detailed for me to dismiss out of hand.”

Failla also concluded the class would not suffer from any diminished quality in legal representation from the firm’s co-lead counsel—the law firms Selendy Gay Elsberg and Schneider Wallace.

Roche Denial

Roche and Ava Labs Chief Executive Officer Emin Gun Sirer have categorically denied allegations that they targeted competitors through litigation. Sirer has said Roche made false statements about their relationship to impress potential business partners.

Roche Freedman responded to the recordings by kicking Roche off its class action practice and barring him from participating or benefiting financially from ongoing class action matters.

Still, opposing counsel in at least five matters, including the entities behind the BitMEX crypto exchange and TRON blockchain protocol, have pushed for the entire firm’s removal.

Even Roche Freedman’s co-lead counsel in the action against Bitfinex and Tether pushed for the firm’s termination on grounds that it would eliminate a “sideshow.”

A partnership agreement produced in court in 2021 showed that Roche retained Ava Labs as a client in 2019 and that the blockchain developer agreed to distribute some of its Ava Labs tokens to partners in exchange for legal services.

Roche’s fellow name partner Devin “Velvel” Freedman has acknowledged that some of the firm’s attorneys own tokens issued by Ava Labs or equity interest in the company. He has said such engagement is not improper and that the firm has never abused the legal system.

The law firm did not comment on Failla’s Oct. 13 decision.",[],
https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/news/corporate-strategy-snippets/roche-eyes-competition,Roche eyes up the competition,"Since its US launch in January for wet AMD and diabetic macular oedema, Roche’s bispecific Vabysmo has been one of the company’s strongest growth drivers, racking up sales of SFr282m ($282m) by the end of September. And much of this has come at Regeneron’s expense. Bill Anderson, chief executive of Roche Pharmaceuticals, said yesterday that 85-95% of Vabysmo sales have come from patients switching from other drugs, the rest being drug-naïve patients. Of those who have switched, 70% have come off Eylea, and 15-20% have abandoned Roche’s own Lucentis. A quick calculation suggests that Regeneron, which sells Eylea in the US, has therefore lost around $178m of Eylea sales to Vabysmo in the first three quarters of 2022. Regeneron has not yet released its Q3 figures, but in Q2 Eylea brought in $1.6bn in the US, so revenues lost to Roche’s bispecific are, so far, little more than a fleabite. But this could change: according to Evaluate Pharma sellside consensus, by 2028 Vabysmo is forecast to sell $3.6bn versus Eylea’s $5.2bn, with the latter also expected to be hit by biosimilar competition from 2024. A lot was already riding on high-dose Eylea, and this asset now looks more important to Regeneron than ever.",[],2022-10-19 00:00:00
https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/asia/roche-pharma-india-launches-mobile-app-cancer-patients,Roche Pharma India launches mobile app for cancer patients,"Roche Pharma India has launched a mobile patient app for those taking part in its cancer support programme.

The company's flagship patient assistance programme Blue Tree caters to cancer, haemophilia and rare disease patients. Over 11,000 patients are currently enrolled in this programme.

A new companion mobile app called Blue Tree 2.0 is improving access to the services of this programme. Roche India developed the app together with smart technology company MOURI Tech.

WHAT IT'S ABOUT

Patients currently enrolled in the Blue Tree programme can now request drug assistance and book expert consultations and diagnostic support services such as genomic profiling via the mobile app.

Available on both Android and iOS devices, the Blue Tree app also delivers notifications about upcoming infusion schedules and other appointments, such as for diagnostic testing and counselling.

Its other features include digital programme enrollment, booking doorstep medicines delivery, and access to funding support and accurate and verified information about diseases.

In the future, Roche India will come up with similar apps for healthcare providers, hospitals and distributors.

WHY IT MATTERS

The launch of Roche India's newest patient app is not not only improving patients' and doctors' experiences with the Blue Tree programme but is also expanding the scale and reach of the programme, especially for those living in remote communities. It is also enabling patients to manage their programme journey through their mobile phones.

To make the experience more integrated, Roche has tapped Tata 1MG to manage the services carried out by Blue Tree. It also partnered with Vardhaman and IMS for last-mile medicine deliveries.

THE LARGER TREND

Last year at the height of the pandemic, Roche India launched the REACH mobile app to support the emotional well-being of healthcare professionals. The app provides access to counselling sessions and self-help content, as well as self-assessment tools on work-related challenges, parenting and relationship issues, wellness, and self-development.",[],2022-11-30 23:35:11-05:00
https://www.labiotech.eu/trends-news/sysnav-roche-movement-tracking-technology/,Sysnav and Roche partner on movement tracking technology,"Sysnav Healthcare and Roche have partnered to develop industry standard outcome measurements in diseases associated with movement impairments, as well as designing the next generation of wearable technology based on Sysnav’s technology.

Patients living with a neuromuscular disorder often suffer from movement impairments that fundamentally impact their daily life. Reliable, objective measurements of a patient’s change in motor function can help doctors prescribe the most appropriate therapy and support research aimed to develop new medicines which improve lives.

Sysnav Healthcare has developed medical grade wearables based on magneto-inertial technology for 3D movement reconstruction. This enables precise movement tracking without GPS, thus protecting patient privacy while enabling indoor monitoring. Sysnav has already secured the first qualification of a digital endpoint (SV95c) with the European Medicines Agency for Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, having worked closely with academic collaborators, patients associations and Roche.

Sysnav and Roche have expanded their collaboration across multiple programs to develop meaningful digital endpoints that will monitor disease progression, support clinical trials and serve as regulatory approved standards of outcome measurement.

The partnership will also develop the next generation wearable technology to further promote personalized healthcare.

Measuring disease progression

“Sysnav’s technology offers the opportunity to measure functional disease progression to a regulatory standard across a range of diseases. This has the potential to improve the way patients are involved in clinical studies, the ability to determine potential treatment benefits, and enrich our understanding of disease pathophysiology,” said James Sabry, global head of Roche Pharma Partnering.

“When high precision technology meets clinical expertise, it is a game-changing combination to accelerate medical progress. Bringing together Sysnav’s digital health technology and Roche’s expertise in neuroscience drug development and personalized healthcare will enable us to have a truly meaningful impact on patients with motor impairments. By establishing a new set of industry standards for the evaluation of motor impairments, we can unlock innovation for the benefit of all patients,” said Damien Eggenspieler, Sysnav Healthcare program director.

Results from the test will help closely track the virus’ lineage and provide insights into the epidemiology and impact it has on public health.

Concern from the World Health Organisation centres around the XBB.1.5 high transmissibility and growth advantage.1





Basel, 26 January 2023 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) and its subsidiary TIB Molbiol have developed a COVID-19 PCR test for researchers that detects and differentiates the latest variant of concern, XBB.1.5. The XBB.1.5 variant is prevalent in the United States and is quickly spreading to other countries. Being able to differentiate emerging variants and understand their similarities and mutations provides a basis for experts to make predictions about their spread and respond with appropriate treatment strategies. The test, VirSNiP SARS-CoV-2 Spike F486P, is for use on the LightCycler® 480 II and cobas® z 480.

“Roche continues to develop timely diagnostic innovations related to COVID-19 by providing valuable insights - helping scientists and physicians understand this new strain, how it differs from other variants, and the impact it may have on public health,” said Matt Sause, CEO of Roche Diagnostics. “Since the start of this global health crisis, Roche has been committed to bringing effective diagnostic solutions to address unmet needs to healthcare communities worldwide.”

XBB.1.5 is a sub-variant of a SARS-CoV-2 variant named XBB. That lineage is a recombinant of two descendants of the BA.2 lineage that began spiking in early 2022. BA.2 is also a sub-variant of Omicron. XBB’s spike protein is a group of mutations that boost the variant’s ability to evade antibodies.2 All Roche on-market COVID-19 tests are not impacted by this sub-variant.

The research-use-only test, VirSNiP SARS-CoV-2 Spike F486P, adds to the broad suite of COVID-19 test kits developed by Roche and TIB Molbiol. Roche and TIB Molbiol’s researchers continue to work in collaboration with partners globally to screen for new variants and emerging diseases.

About the VirSNiP SARS-CoV-2 Spike F486P

The VirSNiP SARS-CoV-2 Spike F486P test is for research use only and it specifically targets the unique mutation F486P found within the XBB.1.5 Omicron sub-variant. Typical clinical samples are throat and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, saliva or gargle solution.

https://pharmaphorum.com/news/roche-lilly-join-forces-blood-test-alzheimers,"Roche, Lilly join forces on blood test for Alzheimer’s","Roche and Eli Lilly have started testing a blood test that could be used to diagnose Alzheimer’s before symptoms arise, providing an alternative to expensive brain scans and speeding up the identification of people at risk of the disease.

The two pharma companies – both active in trying to develop new therapies for the neurodegenerative disorder – are starting a two-year trial of Roche Diagnostics’ Elecsys Amyloid Plasma Panel (EAPP) test, which detects trace levels of beta amyloid protein in the blood and was recently given breakthrough status by the FDA.

The expectation is that earlier identification of patients destined to develop Alzheimer’s could allow treatment to start earlier, now that drugs targeting the amyloid plaques that characterise the disease are available from Eisai and Biogen.

The EAPP test, which runs on Roche’s widely-used Elecsys analysers, could potentially also be used to accelerate recruitment of patients into clinical trials of new treatments, and help researchers make faster progress in understanding the complex disease.

At the moment, Alzheimer’s is typically diagnosed with the help of time-consuming and expensive PET brain scans or invasive spinal fluid analysis, coupled with cognitive testing. Access to PET scans can be challenging, however, and, according to Roche and Lilly, up to 75% of people living with the symptoms of Alzheimer’s worldwide are still without a diagnosis.

Those who have received a diagnosis waited an average of 2.8 years after symptom onset, they point out, adding that swifter diagnosis could help alleviate strain on healthcare systems. The EAPP could also be used to identify patients less likely to develop amyloid deposits and who may have other forms of dementia, helping to direct the appropriate use of new medicines.

Roche told Reuters that the new trial will enrol several hundred volunteers with early signs of dementia over the next 18 to 24 months, in the hope of preparing a regulatory filing for the EAPP test in 2025.

Roche’s Genentech division reported disappointing top-line results from its highly-anticipated phase 3 trial of anti-amyloid antibody gantenerumab in early Alzheimer’s disease last year. The company is still actively seeking a way forward with half a dozen candidates addressing amyloid and other targets, including tau protein, at various stages of clinical development.

Lilly, meanwhile, is awaiting further results with its amyloid drug donanemab, after the FDA rejected accelerated approval of the drug on the grounds that there were too few patients in the dataset that had received the drug for at least 12 months.",[],

Acquired from Biogen Idec by Genentech (later part of the Roche Group) in 2004, the Oceanside, California site boasts seven buildings with 575,000 square feet of manufacturing capacity spread across 60 acres.

Now the firm has broken ground on another facility, which will produce small-batch commercial biologics.

The plant, which forms part of a $450 million expansion at Oceanside, will work in unison with Genentech’s recently completed $250 million Clinical Supply Center in South San Francisco. The facility aims to support Roche’s early phase clinical trial biologic candidates and centers around a ‘ballroom’ style bioreactor setup, allowing rapid reconfiguring of equipment for various scenarios and scales.

The facility “is at the forefront of a modern manufacturing evolution,” said Jeff Davis, executive director at the Clinical Supply Center. “Keeping pace with the increasingly personalized nature of health care, it presents a new model for small-batch manufacturing that enables speedier bench-to-bedside delivery of clinical trial medicines and more agile production of potential therapeutics for smaller patient populations, including those with rare diseases or specific biomarker-driven subtypes of cancer.”

Once the Oceanside facility is online (expected 2025), tech transfers between the two sites will occur at what the company says will be unprecedented speed. “It will just take a matter of days – instead of the traditional six to eighteen months – to complete this process, ultimately getting medicines to patients faster.”",['Dan Stanton'],2023-02-13 11:41:29+00:00

The level of beta-amyloid removal by gantenerumab was lower than expected

Topline data will be presented at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) Conference

Roche is committed to the Alzheimer’s community and will continue to develop novel diagnostics and potential treatments for Alzheimer’s

Basel, 14 November 2022 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced results from the GRADUATE I and II studies evaluating gantenerumab in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s and mild Alzheimer’s dementia, collectively called early Alzheimer’s disease. The studies did not meet their primary endpoint of slowing clinical decline. Gantenerumab was well tolerated, including the subcutaneous administration.

“So many of our families have been directly affected by Alzheimer’s, so this news is very disappointing to deliver,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are profoundly grateful to the study participants, their care partners and study sites for their contributions to this research. While the GRADUATE results are not what we hoped, we are proud to have delivered a high quality, clear and comprehensive Alzheimer’s dataset to the field, and we look forward to sharing our learnings with the community as we continue to search for new treatments for this complex disease.”

Study participants treated with gantenerumab showed a slowing of clinical decline in GRADUATE I and GRADUATE II of -0.31 (p=0.0954), and -0.19 (p=0.2998) respectively from baseline score on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), however, neither was statistically significant. This represents a relative reduction in clinical decline of 8% in GRADUATE I and 6% in GRADUATE II compared with placebo. The CDR-SB measures cognitive and functional change across six areas including memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care.

The level of beta-amyloid removal, the protein that builds up to make plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, was lower than expected. Roche will present topline findings of the GRADUATE I and II studies at the upcoming Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) Conference on Wednesday, 30 November, 2022 at 16:15 PT.

Amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) are a common radiological finding associated with amyloid-targeting therapies. The incidence of ARIA-E (oedema or effusion) in the pooled gantenerumab arms was 25%, with the vast majority being asymptomatic and very few leading to treatment discontinuation. The incidence of isolated ARIA-H (haemosiderin) was balanced across the gantenerumab and placebo groups.

Roche remains committed to Alzheimer’s disease, one of the most complex neurological disorders and a major public health challenge. The company is continuing to develop and deliver tests to enable early and accurate Alzheimer’s diagnosis and has a pipeline of investigational medicines for different targets, types and stages of the disease.

About the GRADUATE I and II studies

The Phase III GRADUATE I and II studies were two global, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the investigational anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody gantenerumab in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s and mild Alzheimer’s dementia over 27 months. 1,965 study participants across 30 countries were randomised 1:1 to receive gantenerumab or placebo by subcutaneous injection titrated to reach a target dose of 510 mg administered every two weeks. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) at 116 weeks. The CDR-SB measures cognitive and functional change across six areas including memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. There were 17 secondary endpoints including change in disease severity assessed using various neuropsychological and functional assessment tools (e.g., MMSE, ADAS-Cog, etc.), assessment of therapeutic levels of gantenerumab, incidence of adverse events, disease biomarkers and scans. A full list is available at clinicaltrials.gov.

About gantenerumab

Gantenerumab is a fully-human monoclonal IgG1 antibody, an investigational medicine that is subcutaneously administered and designed to target and bind to aggregated forms of beta-amyloid, including oligomers, fibrils and plaques, and activate immune cells in the brain (microglia) to clear amyloid plaques and prevent further accumulation. Gantenerumab was discovered in collaboration with MorphoSys.

Swiss pharma giant Roche’s stock (OTCMKTS: RHHBY) was up 6% in yesterday’s trading session. This can be attributed to Biogen’s BIIB success with its Alzheimer’s treatment - Lecanemab - in late-stage clinical trials. Lecanemab removed built-up plaque in the brain called beta amyloid, resulting in a cognitive benefit for patients with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease. [1] Now, Roche is also testing an Alzheimer’s treatment with a similar objective to cut down on beta amyloid levels in the brain. While Biogen’s share rose a stellar 40% yesterday, the development helped some other pharmaceutical stocks with Alzheimer’s treatments in the pipeline, including Roche, Eli Lilly, and Prothena.

Despite yesterday’s move, Roche stock is down 24% this year, in line with the decline in the broader S&P500 index. The company’s diagnostics business, which led the revenue growth since the beginning of the pandemic due to high demand for Covid-19 testing, is expected to see a decline in sales in the near term. For perspective, Diagnostics sales surged 49% between 2019 and 2021. Roche also sells Ronapreve – a treatment for Covid-19, developed by Regeneron and distributed by Roche outside the U.S. The Covid-19-related products accounted for $7 billion of the $72 billion sales for Roche in 2021. There have been rising concerns over the future growth drivers for Roche, given that its Covid-19-related products will see a fall in sales in the near term. A sell-off in broader markets due to higher inflation and rising interest rates slowing the economic growth isn’t helping Roche stock either.

That said, Roche’s pharmaceutical business is seeing a steady rise in sales, benefiting from the continued uptick of its relatively new drugs, including Perjeta, Kadcyla, Alecensa, Tecentriq, Actemra, Hemlibra, and Ocrevus, a trend expected to continue going forward. See our dashboard on Roche Revenue for an overview of Roche’s business model and how its revenues are likely to trend.

https://www.roche.com/stories/evolution-of-clinical-trials/,The continuing evolution of clinical trials,"Nowadays, clinical trials are highly structured and regulated, ensuring the safety of the participants. At Roche we are committed to creating innovative clinical trials that give maximum benefit to patients.

Today, clinical trials have to comply with rigorous rules and ethical compliance. Clinical trials are highly structured, and in addition to efficacy, they also determine side effects, interactions and long-term effects.

For Heidemarie (also known as Heidi) Kletzl, Clinical Pharmacologist, and Yumi Cleary, Pharmacometrician, this level of rigor is absolutely necessary and makes every success that much sweeter, especially in the case of rare diseases, where treatment options are often scarce.

“We work in a strictly regulated environment to ensure we gather the necessary data in a safe manner without undue risks for the patients,” Heidi explains. “It usually takes from six months to a year to plan and set up a trial, and it can take several years to enrol patients and collect the required data. All these highly controlled procedures are important because in the end we need to be sure that the medicine is working as intended and is safe.”",[],
https://en.hdbuzz.net/339,Roche Phase II GENERATION HD2 study underway,"By Dr Rachel Harding Edited by Dr Leora Fox

Roche released a community letter last month, detailing how their Phase II clinical trial to study the huntingtin-lowering drug, tominersen, is now underway. Learn more about what this means in this article and at the recent HDSA Research Webinar, with representatives from the company.

The ups and downs of huntingtin-lowering

Tominersen is a type of drug called an ASO, which aims to lower levels of the huntingtin protein, and is delivered through spinal injections. People with Huntington’s disease make an expanded form of the huntingtin protein, due to an expansion in their huntingtin gene. By reducing the amount of the expanded huntingtin protein, scientists working on these drugs hope they might slow or halt the progression of symptoms of Huntington’s. Many companies are working on huntingtin-lowering using different types of drugs, including Roche, Wave, uniQure, and PTC therapeutics.

Roche scientists then spent a long time poring over all the findings from GENERATION HD1 and uncovered some trends suggesting that tominersen may have benefitted some trial participants

The path of tominersen from the research lab to this most recent clinical trial has certainly been a bumpy one. A study of tominersen which concluded in 2019 was the first to show that it was possible to lower levels of the huntingtin protein. It also appeared to be safe in people for the duration of the 3-month trial. In a subsequent Phase III trial, called GENERATION HD1, more than 800 participants were enrolled to test if tominersen might improve signs and symptoms of Huntington’s. Unfortunately, GENERATION HD1 was cut short due to safety issues. We still don’t fully understand the reasons for this, but participants who received the highest and most frequent dose of the drug did worse by many measures than patients who were given the placebo, the exact opposite of what we had hoped for.

Roche scientists then spent a long time poring over all the findings from GENERATION HD1 and uncovered some trends suggesting that tominersen may have benefitted some trial participants, especially those who were younger and began the trial with less prominent symptoms of HD. This type of analysis where scientists pick back through subsets of the data is called “post hoc"". The original GENERATION HD1 study was not designed to answer the question of whether the drug is better for this category of Huntington’s patients, but there does seem to be a potentially promising pattern. To address this question properly, Roche scientists need to run another clinical trial and this is how GENERATION HD2 came about.

GENERATION HD2 - a fresh approach to questions about tominersen

This new trial will try to answer a few different questions about the possibility of using tominersen as a treatment for Huntington’s, focusing on the safety of the drug and whether it’s properly hitting its target (huntingtin).

First, scientists will hope to answer if lower doses of tominersen are safe as a long-term treatment for this younger, less progressed subgroup of Huntington’s patients. As with previous trials, lots of different measures will be taken to check for participant safety.

Second, they will investigate if tominersen has impacts on biomarkers of Huntington’s, things that can be measured in blood or spinal fluid to get a picture of brain health. This will include a protein called NfL, levels of which go up in people suffering symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases.

Thirdly, they will assess how well the drug is hitting its target in this more focused patient group. This will include a measure of the huntingtin protein itself, which we expect to be lowered, as we have seen in previous tominersen studies.

Lastly, they’ll also look at how tominersen affects peoples’ thinking, movements, and behaviour.

Everyone recruited into this trial will be randomly assigned to one of three groups, where they will either receive a low 60 mg dose of tominersen, a higher 100 mg dose of tominersen, or a placebo dose. Both doses are lower than the 120 mg tested in GENERATION HD1. As per previous tominersen trials the drug will be given by spinal tap, but in this trial, everyone will receive their dose every 4 months for a total of 16 months of treatment and monitoring. Data collected will be assessed approximately every 4 months by an independent data monitoring committee (iDMC) which will monitor the trial safety and look at the clinical and biomarker data to see how things are progressing. This is confidential, unless there are serious issues, and completely independent of Roche’s own analysis of the data which will happen when the trial ends.

Who will be enrolled into this new trial?

This new trial will last 16 months, and approximately 360 participants will be enrolled. To follow up on their post hoc analysis from GENERATION HD1, this study will be enrolling participants aged 25-50 years old who have only the very early signs of Huntington’s. You may have read the terms “prodromal” or “early manifest,” which is the science-y way doctors and researchers refer to people with Huntington’s right around the time that movement symptoms appear.

The study will take place across 4 continents with sites in 15 countries spread across North America, Europe, South America and Oceania. Precise information about the sites will become available once they are each approved and will be posted on clinical trial directories such as www.clinicaltrials.gov (global) and www.hdtrialfinder.org (North America), but sites are expected in Argentina, Austria, Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, UK and the USA. Each site may have slightly different rules about participant recruitment i.e. how close to the site you need to live to be considered for enrollment, and not all of the sites from previous tominersen trials will participate in the GENERATION HD2 trial. Keep in mind that most clinical trials recruit through strong relationships between doctors and patients.

Those individuals who were previously in a trial testing tominersen would only be eligible for enrollment in GENERATION HD2 if they had received the placebo dose. Roche stated that their decision to exclude individuals who previously received tominersen was not made lightly, and was made “following extensive consultation with HD experts and community leaders.” This news, and the narrower age range for eligibility, may be very disappointing for some. But Roche is committed to answering important safety questions about tominersen, based on previous data. Although this trial will focus on younger people with less advanced HD symptoms, Roche emphasised that they have not forgotten the complete range of patients which comprise the HD community, nor the commitment of previous participants, and there may be other opportunities for these folks in future.

How can I learn more about GENERATION HD2?

Roche participated in an HDSA Research Webinar last week where more of the specifics of the trial were discussed, including the precise criteria for participant enrollment and members of the Huntington’s community put their own questions directly to the scientists at Roche. You can rewatch this webinar here until early April, 2023. Stay tuned on HDBuzz for more news as things progress.

https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/roche-firm-booted-from-tether-action-after-crypto-leaks-post,Roche Firm Booted From Tether Action After Crypto Leaks Post (1),"A New York judge on Thursday removed Roche Freedman from representing plaintiffs in a class action that accuses the crypto exchange Bitfinex and Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, of market manipulation.

The decision is a blow for Roche Freedman after videos posted on a website called Crypto Leaks showed founding partner Kyle Roche boasting about the law firm’s relationship with the crypto startup Ava Labs.

Katherine Polk Failla, a U.S. district judge for the Southern District of New York, said in a hearing Thursday that the firm’s continued participation in the case could derail litigation. She said she would modify her initial lead counsel appointment to remove the firm.

Allowing the firm to continue serving as counsel “with the metaphorical baggage they now carry is not in the best interests of the class,” Failla said.

Roche Freedman did not immediately return a request for comment.

During an Oct. 3 hearing, Failla called Roche’s comments “uniquely stupid” and pressed co-founder Devin “Velvel” Freedman on the firm’s conduct while litigating the 2019 lawsuit.

Freedman said Roche’s comments were “stupid” but argued there was no evidence Roche Freedman brought a lawsuit to help Ava Labs, and that concerns about the law firm abusing discovery were unfounded.

The law firms Selendy Gay Elsberg and Schneider Wallace will remain lead counsel for the proposed class, which is pursuing claims that the defendants manipulated prices.

Roche Denial

Roche has denied his firm has used litigation to target Ava Labs competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer has also said that the videos posted on Crypto Leaks showed Roche making false statements about their relationship.

Following the disclosure of the recordings in August, Roche’s firm kicked him off its class action practice and barred him from participating in ongoing class matters. Freedman argued that it took such steps to protect against the appearance of impropriety.

Still, Bitfinex and Tether moved to terminate Roche Freedman from the case, claiming the comments raised concerns about the firm’s motivations. Roche Freedman’s co-counsel, meanwhile, argued that booting the firm would eliminate a distraction.

A separate plaintiffs firm filed a motion to substitute Roche Freedman as lead counsel, but Failla on Thursday rejected that application.

Disqualification

Roche Freedman faces disqualification motions in at least four other cases, according to federal court filings.

A different New York judge has scheduled a Friday hearing in an action the firm brought on behalf of investors against the Tron Foundation, the company behind the TRON blockchain protocol.

Launched in 2019 by expats of the prominent litigation shop Boies Schiller, Roche Freedman has become one of the most active firms in the cryptocurrency class action space.

The firm, which was granted lead counsel status in the Bitfinex and Tether action in 2020, argued that it had the most expertise in digital assets and that Roche’s “false comments” should not impugn the rest of the firm.

Freedman also claimed during the Oct. 3 hearing that a defendant in one of the actions the firm brought was behind the surreptitious recordings of Roche.

Failla, however, said that Roche’s comments were “too detailed to dismiss out of hand.” The putative class also will not suffer from any diminished quality of legal representation with the law firm’s removal, she concluded.",[],
https://www.biospace.com/article/roche-ionis-chinook-and-vera-move-forward-in-igan-/,"Roche/Ionis, Chinook and Vera Eye Phase III in IgAN","Courtesy of Gado/Getty Images

Biopharma’s continuous efforts to conquer immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), also called Berger's disease, were on display at the American Society of Nephrology's Kidney Week 2022 this weekend.

Roche and Ionis Head to Phase III

Following positive Phase II data, Roche is planning to take an Ionis-developed antisense drug candidate into a late-stage clinical trial in the first part of 2023.

Ionis presented positive data Sunday from a Phase II trial assessing IONIS-FB-L as a potential treatment for patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), also known as Berger’s disease. Data showed the drug candidate reduced proteinuria by 44% after 29 weeks. In addition, Ionis reported:

Kidney function as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate was maintained.

The drug led to “robust and sustained reductions” in plasma complement Factor B, alternative pathway activity (AH50) and urinary complement fragment Ba (Factor Ba).

A favorable safety and tolerability profile was maintained.

IONIS-FB-L uses Ionis’ LIgand Conjugated Antisense (LICA) technology. It is designed to reduce the production of complement factor B, a key protein in the complement innate immune system. Over-action of the FB protein is associated with the development of multiple complement-mediated diseases, including IgAN.

Roche and Ionis teamed up in July on the development of IONIS-FB-L in IgAN.

Chinook’s IgAN Treatment Also Moves Forward

Seattle-based Chinook Therapeutics shared data from its ongoing Phase I/II trial evaluating BION-1301, a novel anti-APRIL monoclonal antibody.

Blocking APRIL is a potentially disease-modifying approach to treating IgAN, as it reduces circulating levels of galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1), Chinook stated in the press release.

Data from two cohorts treated in the study showed BION-1301 generated “rapid and sustained” reductions in IgA and Gd-IgA1 levels, the company announced Friday.

In cohort 1: intravenous treatment with BION-1301 showed significant reduction of proteinuria throughout the study. At 12 weeks, proteinuria was reduced by 30.4%. At 24 weeks, the reduction increased to 48.8%. By 52 weeks, reduction had reached 66.9%.

In Cohort 2, patients received a subcutaneous version of BION-1301. Data showed mean proteinuria reductions of 28.7% in 15 patients at 12 weeks of treatment. Reduction levels increased the longer patients remained on treatment. At 24 weeks, nine patients showed a 53.8% reduction.

Eric Dobmeier, president and chief executive officer of Chinook, said the reductions observed to date are highly consistent between both cohorts. Based on this data, Dobmeier said the company intends to move forward with a Phase III trial in IgAN next year.

Vera’s Atacicept Reduces Immune Complex Levels

On Saturday, Brisbane, Calif.-based Vera Therapeutics shared data from its Phase IIa JANUS study that showed atacicept reduced immune complex levels in patients with IgAN.

Data from the JANUS study showed atacicept decreased circulatory Gd-IgA1 in IgAN patients and led to a reduction of anti-Gd-IgA1 antibodies.

Marshall Fordyce, CEO of Vera, told BioSpace the data shows atacicept can reduce the immune clusters that cause IgAN.

The drug candidate reduced Gd-IgA1, the ""bad-acting molecule"" that triggers the immune complex that causes the disease by 60%, Fordyce said.

Vera has provided the rationale that atacicept is “turning off the faucet” of the disease, he added.

Now, the company is awaiting additional data to determine whether atacicept can reduce proteinuria.

Such a reduction should lead to better outcomes for patients, Fordyce said, adding that Vera is hoping for at least a 30% reduction of proteinuria. This is the threshold set by Calliditas Therapeutics' Tarpeyo, which last year became the first approved medication to decrease urine protein in IgA nephropathy.

If the data is positive, Fordyce anticipates a Phase III trial could begin in 2023 with a possible data readout in 2025.

A Significant Opportunity

IgAN has become a highly contested area for multiple companies. An estimated 400,000 people suffer from IgAN across the United States and Europe. About half of these patients are expected to develop end-stage renal disease within 20 years from initial diagnosis, which will lead to dialysis or kidney transplant.",[],

Healthcare providers can order the test through BioReference and its specialty division, GenPath Women’s Health.

The test uses dual biomarker technology to simultaneously detect p16 and Ki-67 in women with HPV-positive results. Co-expression of these two biomarkers within the same cell is a strong indicator that an HPV infection is undergoing oncogenic transformation, according to Roche.

BioReference will offer the test to women from ages 30 to 65 as a reflex when the cytology result is negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) and the high-risk HPV result is positive using Roche’s Cobas HPV test.

The dual-stain biomarker test allows a treating healthcare provider to more accurately and quickly assess the risk for cervical pre-cancer in patients, BioReference said, adding that the test can reduce the number and frequency of follow-up visits.",['Feb'],2023-02-09 00:00:00
https://www.ruddfuneralhome.com/obituaries/colleen-newman,Colleen Marie Roche Newman Obituary 2023,"Colleen Marie Roche Newman, (also known by most as Mickey), finally agreed that her work on earth was done, and passed away peacefully on January 14th, 2023 in Smithfield, UT.

Colleen was born on a warm September day in 1937 in Thatcher, UT. Making her the thirteenth child born at home to Alan and Alice Roche. Now the day of her birth could be the 9th or the 10th? Birth certificate is recorded as the 10th, but on her parent’s headstone it is engraved as the 9th, baptism certificate is written as the 10th, temple recommend shows the 9th. In Alice’s journal she states that right after giving birth to Connie, (the sister just younger than Colleen) she walked out to milk the cow. Needless to say, I think births were just another day in the BIG Roche family.

It was because of some “loving” siblings and close friends who pointed out Colleen’s big Mickey Mouse ears that she was then called and answered to as, Mickey.

She was a happy young farm girl that learned to work hard at a very young age. Mickey also led by example; gardening and canning, sewing and mending, feeding and working cattle, tending small children, cooking for her large family, and continually proving she could outwork her older brothers! There was never a job too large or too small that she would not tackle.

At only fourteen years old, Mickey fell in love with Duane Newman. He was a handsome local farm boy, that had returned home from serving an LDS mission. On June 16th, 1952, they were sealed in the Salt Lake Temple. She was a busy wife, and soon raising three children – Rodney H, Tena Marie and MaryAnn, but still tried to sneak in a night at the bowling alley when she could. Sadly, when Mary Ann was only two years old, she got pneumonia and passed away. Mickey was an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and with this faith, she believed and knew she would see MaryAnn again.

Life took Mickey and Duane to Rexburg ID, where she spent 30 plus years working alongside Dr. Lane Ward in his dental office. She was loyal, well known, and admired in her community. Her talents and time helped others as she donated many quilts to Humanitarian Aid. But, not before she had completed a blanket for each of her 12 grandchildren and 44 great grandchildren. Mickey also kept a close relationship with her sisters. These classy ladies had the Diet Coke stocked and ""BS'd"" while they sewed for hours, canned for days, and packaged homemade Christmas candy for their families.

After retiring, Mickey and Duane hooked up their travel trailer, put on their square-dancing shoes, and traveled to various competitions. After seeing the Golden Gate Bridge, Mount Rushmore, and many National Parks, they made their next home in St. George, UT. Mickey loved when family came to visit and made sure they all had full bellies when they left. She instilled strong core values in her family that have served us all well

We will cherish the memories of her dust free home, her red lipstick kisses, and the cup of green tea in the microwave . But, how lucky is her husband Duane, her daughter MaryAnn, a son-in-law Jeff, a grandson Benjamin, and two great granddaughters to be in her presence now?!

Please join us for our sweet, Colleen’s funeral on Monday, January 23rd, 2023 at 11:00 A.M., with a viewing prior from 9:00 – 10:30 at the Bothwell LDS church, 10350 W 11600 N, in Bothwell, UT. Interment at the Valley View Bothwell Cemetery. The service will be livestreamed and may be accessed below.",[],

StockWatch appears weekly in GEN Edge. Subscribe today to GEN Edge, and keep a leading edge on your competition.

Analysts soured on Roche this week after the pharma giant acknowledged that its Alzheimer’s disease candidate gantenerumab became the latest in a decades-long string of clinical failures among treatment candidates for the memory-robbing neuro disease.

Gantenerumab failed the Phase III GRADUATE I (NCT03444870) and GRADUATE II (NCT03443973) trials by missing their primary endpoints of slowing clinical decline. Patients treated with gantenerumab showed reductions in cognitive decline of 8% (-0.31, p=0.0954) in GRADUATE I and 6% (-0.19, p=0.2998) in GRADUATE II from baseline score on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB)—neither of which was statistically significant.

“This news is very disappointing to deliver,” Levi Garraway, MD, PhD, Roche’s chief medical officer and head of global product development, lamented in a statement. “While the GRADUATE results are not what we hoped, we are proud to have delivered a high quality, clear and comprehensive Alzheimer’s dataset to the field, and we look forward to sharing our learnings with the community as we continue to search for new treatments for this complex disease.”

Roche said it will present topline findings of the GRADUATE I and II studies on November 30 at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) Conference, to be held in San Francisco.

The company added that it “remains committed to Alzheimer’s disease,” and to that effect “is continuing to develop and deliver tests to enable early and accurate Alzheimer’s diagnosis and has a pipeline of investigational medicines for different targets, types and stages of the disease.”

Analysts at two firms responded with quick downgrades or Roche stock. Cowen analyst Steve Scala went from “Outperform” to “Market Perform,” and announced his firm set a $48 price target. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Eric Le Berrigaud went further, cutting his firm’s price target on Roche from CHF 375 to CHF 345 ($397 to $365), in addition to lowering its rating from “Buy” to “Hold.”

Investors appeared more sanguine than the analysts about Roche, judging by the decline in its share price. Roche (ROG), whose shares trade on the SIX Swiss Exchange, saw its stock decline 4% on Monday, from CHF 325.60 to CHF 312.65 ($344.84 to $331.13) before inching up 0.5% on Tuesday, to CHF 314.35 ($332.94).

However, Roche’s collaboration partner in developing gantenerumab, MorphoSys, incurred the fuller wrath of investors. MorphoSys (MOR) shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Prime Standard market segment tumbled 29% on Monday, from €20.90 to €14.80 ($21.72 to $15.38), after joining with Roche to announce the clinical trial failures of gantenerumab. MorphoSys continued its stock slide, declining 2% on Tuesday to €14.56 ($15.13), then dipping another 1% on Wednesday, to €14.40 ($14.97).

Biogen, Lilly stand to gain

Two other analysts highlighted rival developers of amyloid beta-targeting antibodies indicated for Alzheimer’s that may stand to gain from Roche’s setback with gantenerumab. Two such companies are Biogen and Eisai, the developers of lecanemab (formerly BAN2401), an anti-amyloid beta (Aβ) protofibril antibody designed to treat mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD and mild AD (collectively called “early AD”) with a confirmed presence of amyloid pathology in the brain.

“From a competitive standpoint, Roche’s result means Eisai/BIIB’s lecanemab remains the only product that has shown an unequivocally positive dataset in early AD [Alzheimer’s], and the stock is up nicely on the news,” Sumant Kulkarni, Senior Biotechnology Analyst with Canaccord Genuity and a managing director, wrote Monday in a research note.

Lecanemab is under FDA review for accelerated approval, with a target decision date of January 6, 2023, under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). The FDA accepted Eisai’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for lecanemab under the accelerated approval pathway and granted Priority Review in July.

Biogen and Eisai said September 27 that lecanemab aced their confirmatory Phase III Clarity AD trial (NCT03887455) by achieving the study’s primary endpoint of statistically significant reduction in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) at 18 months compared to placebo.

Lecanemab treatment reduced clinical decline on CDR-SB by 27% (-0.45, p=0.00005) in the study, which enrolled 1,795 patients with early AD—of which about 25% of the roughly 1,030 U.S. patients were Hispanic or African American. Lecanemab also met all of the study’s key secondary endpoints with highly statistically significant results, the companies added.

Biogen and Eisai are also set to present further data at CTAD in San Francisco. “We will be looking for more details on what lecanemab’s CTAD data might mean from a regulatory/labeling perspective,” Kyulkrni said, citing the FDA’s initial broad label for Biogen/Eisai’s controversial Alzheimer’s drug Aduhelm® (aducanumab), which won accelerated approval last year

In March, Biogen obtained sole decision-making authority over the development, commercialization and manufacturing of Aduhelm when Eisai gave up sharing global profits in favor of a global royalty arrangement starting at 2% and reaching 8% when annual sales exceed $1 billion.

Kulkarni has projected worldwide peak sales for lecanemab of $4.2 billion in 2033: “Given the significant size of the AD market, we could be conservative, but we would prefer to wait for additional data before we can get more comfort around even higher sales.”

Lecanemab’s clinical success sparked a 40% surge in Biogen’s stock, from $197.79 to $276.61. As investors sold off shares of Roche and MorphoSys on Monday, they bought into Biogen enough to send its shares rising 3%, from $289.45 to $299.06.

Biogen shares increased 3% on Monday after Roche’s announcement, from $289.45 to $299.06. Eisai shares, which trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, nearly doubled, rose nearly 6% Tuesday (the first trading day after Roche’s announcement), from ¥8,288 to ¥8,753 ($58.98 to $62.29).

Another potential beneficiary from Roche’s failed GRADUATE trials is Eli Lilly.

‘Although Roche’s gantenerumab failed in two Alzheimer’s trials, the news is positive for perception of LLY’s donanemab because the trials showed a positive cognitive benefit trend,” David Risinger, CFA, Head of Diversified Biopharmaceutical Research and a senior managing director with SVB Securities, wrote Monday in a research note that maintained his firm’s “Outperform” rating on Lilly.

Donanemab, which targets a modified form of Aβ called N3pG, is the subject of a Phase III study whose results are expected in the second quarter of 2023. In September, researchers from Lilly and its Avid Radiopharmaceuticals subsidiary published a study in JAMA Neurology showing that the complete amyloid plaque clearance achieved with donanemab in the Phase II TRAILBLAZER-ALZ trial (NCT03367403) was associated with lower amyloid at baseline and slower disease progression at 76 weeks.

The study also showed that participants with higher baseline amyloid levels experienced a greater magnitude of change over 24 weeks, while those with lower baseline amyloid levels were more likely to achieve complete amyloid clearance: “These results predict that those with lower baseline amyloid levels are more likely to be able to stop donanemab treatment sooner,” the researchers concluded.

Illumina flat following job cuts

Illumina (ILMN) shares rose 3% on Tuesday, from $234.57 to $238.49—then fell 3%, to $231.79—after the sequencing giant disclosed in a regulatory filing Monday that it will cut its global workforce of more than 9,100 people by “approximately 5%,” for which it will take a charge against fourth-quarter earnings to reflect the restructuring.

“The Company is proactively realigning Core Illumina operating expenses to reflect the current macro-economic environment while maintaining focus on its innovation roadmap and sustainable long-term growth,” Illumina stated in the filing.

Illumina is slicing its workforce just two weeks after reporting third-quarter 2022 results that included a $3.91 billion “goodwill impairment” charge against earnings due to its “primarily due to the negative impact of current capital market conditions and higher discount rates, including a standalone risk premium, on the fair value calculation of the Grail segment.”

Based on that impairment, Grail finished Q3 with a $4.101 billion operating loss, down from a $750 million operating loss in Q3 2021. Grail revenues quintupled year-over-year from $2 million to $10 million, driven by John Hancock becoming the first insurer to offer customers access to the test. Grail is expected to generate between $55 million and $65 million in revenues this year.

Grail is the cancer blood test developer acquired by Illumina last year for $7.1 billion—a deal that remains at the center of regulatory challenges by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the European Union. Illumina reports its results based on two segments—Grail and its namesake operations, which it calls “Core Illumina.”

In September, Illumina won one battle against regulators and lost another as an FTC administrative law judge ruled in its favor against the agency’s challenge to the Grail acquisition. Soon after, the EU blocked Illumina’s deal, concluding that it would stifle innovation and reduce choice in the emerging market for blood-based early cancer detection tests. The EU cited Illumina being the only “credible” supplier of sequencing technologies to develop and process Grail’s Galleri™ test.

According to Illumina, Galleri can detect more than 50 cancers across all stages—of which more than 45 do not have recommended screening in the United States—and correctly identified the tissue of origin in 93% of positive results, with >99% specificity.

The Grail impairment charge also prompted Illumina to lower its investor guidance for this year, from a 4-5% rise in revenue vs. 2021 to between flat and 1%, with a GAAP diluted loss per share of between $(26.56) and $(26.41), well above the previous range of between $(2.93) and $(2.78).

Illumina said its Core Illumina revenue growth is now expected to be approximately flat from fiscal year 2021 compared with the 3.5% to 4.5% increase projected previously. Grail projected revenues for this year were also revised from the earlier range of $50 million to $70 million.

For Q3, Illumina reported a 1% increase in revenue to $1.12 billion, driven by 50 orders from customers globally for its NovaSeq X sequencing instrument, which the company unveiled in September at its annual conference, the Illumina Genomics Forum.

IPO lifts precision cancer therapy developer

Acrivon Therapeutics (ACRV) shares jumped 33% to $16.64 on Tuesday, the company’s first day as a publicly traded company, having launched an initial public offering (IPO) price that raised $99.4 million in gross proceeds. Shares inched up 1% on Wednesday, to $16.75.

The auspicious debut was a reflection of early investor interest in Acrivon, which develops precision oncology therapies through its proteomics-based patient responder identification platform. The company says it matches its treatments to patients whose tumors are predicted to be sensitive to each specific medicine.

Based in Watertown MA, Acrivon is developing a pipeline whose lead program ACR-368 (also called Prexasertib), which the company in-licenses from Eli Lilly. ACR-368 is a selective inhibitor of the DNA damage response checkpoint kinases CHK1 and CHK2 that according to the company has shown deep, durable single-agent anti-tumor clinical activity, including complete responses, in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and squamous cell cancer.

Acrivon has also identified endometrial and bladder cancer as two additional high unmet need solid tumor types that it predicts will be highly sensitive to the drug candidate.

Acrivon sold 7.55 million shares at the $12.50 IPO price per share on the Nasdaq Global Market, under the ticker symbol ACRV. The company has granted its IPO underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,132,500 shares of common stock at the IPO price, less underwriting discounts and commissions.

In addition, Acrivon announced a concurrent sale of 400,000 shares of common stock at the public offering price per share in a private placement to one of its existing shareholders, Chione Limited.

Jefferies, Cowen and Piper Sandler are acting as joint lead book-running managers for the IPO.

4DMT sees gains from Wet AMD data

4D Molecular Therapeutics (FDMT) shares rocketed 68% this week after the company announced positive interim clinical data Monday from the five patients enrolled in cohort 1 of its Phase I/II trial (NCT05197270) assessing its intravitreal 4D-150 as a treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD).

After being dosed with intravitreal 4D-150, the cohort 1 patients showed a 96.7% reduction in their annualized anti-VEGF injection rate. Four of the five patients did not need to receive any supplemental aflibercept injections for up to about 10 months after dosing at the low dose of 3E10 vg/eye, based on follow-ups at 16, 32, 36, and ~40 weeks, according to the company, which calls itself 4DMT for short.

4DMT described the five as high need patients who in the 12 months preceding trial enrollment had a mean annualized anti-VEGF injection rate of ~11. And in three of the five patients who were evaluated to date, 4D-150-mediated expression of the aflibercept transgene protein was demonstrated in the aqueous humor of the eye at 12 weeks following injection with the treatment.

The five patients were in one of three five-patient cohorts, each cohort given one of three dose levels, expected to range from 3E10 to 1E10 vg/eye. The trial’s dose exploration stage has been completed, and will be followed by a Phase II stage set for the first quarter of 2023, in which 50 patients will be randomized to one of two doses levels of 4D-150 vs Bayer/Regeneron Pharmaceuticals-marketed Eylea® (aflibercept) in a 2:2:1 ratio.

Additional data is set for release in the second quarter of 2023.

4D-150 consists of a dual transgene payload designed to express aflibercept and an anti-VEGF-C RNAi, and a proprietary vector R100 for low dose intravitreal delivery. According to 4DMT, 4D-150 is the first retinal gene therapy that is designed to inhibit all four VEGF-related molecules that drive angiogenesis.

“This clinical data on 4D-150 marks an important milestone for 4DMT,” David Kirn, MD, 4DMT’s Co-founder and CEO, said in a statement. “We are developing 4D-150 for the treatment of large and sustainable markets in ophthalmology, including wet AMD and diabetic macular edema. We believe these results further validate the potential for both our intravitreal R100 vector for other large market eye diseases, and our Therapeutic Vector Evolution platform as an engine to grow our product pipeline.”

4DMT shares rose 8% the day of the announcement, from $12.51 to $13.49, then leaped 38.5% on Tuesday to $18.69 and jumped another 12% on Wednesday, to $21.01.",['Alex Philippidis'],2022-11-17 16:32:43+00:00

EU approval for Vabysmo (severe eye diseases) US approvals for Xofluza (influenza in children) Launch of a digital PCR diagnostic platform and of COVID-19, skin and breast cancer tests “Breakthrough Device Designation” granted for Alzheimer’s blood tests

in the third quarter: Outlook for 2022 confirmed





Severin Schwan, CEO of Roche: “Group sales grew 2% despite the expected sharp decline in COVID-19-related products in both divisions in the third quarter. The demand for our newer medicines for multiple sclerosis, haemophilia, spinal muscular atrophy and cancer remains high. I am particularly pleased that so many patients with severe eye disease have already accessed our new medicine Vabysmo and started treatment. Likewise, our Diagnostics Division base business continued to grow strongly. Based on our current assessment, we confirm the outlook for the full year.”

Outlook for 2022 confirmed

Roche expects stable sales or sales growth in the low-single-digit range (at constant exchange rates). Core earnings per share are targeted to grow in the low- to mid-single-digit range (at constant exchange rates). Roche expects to increase its dividend in Swiss francs further.

Group sales

In the first nine months, the Roche Group generated sales growth of 2% (1% in CHF) to CHF 47 billion.

As expected, the third quarter of 2022 was particularly challenging due to base effects, as the demand for COVID-19 medicines and tests was exceptionally high in the same quarter of 2021.

Sales of the Pharmaceuticals Division were at the same level as in the previous year, at CHF 33.2 billion.

The newer medicines Ocrevus (multiple sclerosis), Hemlibra (haemophilia), Evrysdi (spinal muscular atrophy) and Phesgo (breast cancer) continued their strong growth. The eye medicine Vabysmo, which was only launched at the beginning of the year, is now also one of the strongest growth drivers. These top-five medicines alone generated additional sales totalling CHF 2.2 billion.

As expected, sales growth was offset by the biosimilars-related decline in sales, especially for the established cancer medicines Avastin, MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin. Sales of Actemra/RoActemra and Ronapreve (COVID-19) were also significantly lower than in the same period of 2021, with a decline of roughly CHF 1 billion, as the pandemic continued to weaken in many countries in 2022.

Sales in the United States decreased slightly with 1%. Growth of Ocrevus, Hemlibra, Vabysmo, Xolair and Tecentriq partially offset lower sales of Actemra/RoActemra, Avastin, Herceptin, MabThera/Rituxan, Lucentis and Esbriet.

In Europe, sales were also slightly down by 1%. The main reason for this was the decline in sales of the COVID-19 medicine Ronapreve compared to the previous year. Excluding this base effect, sales in Europe grew by 6%.

Sales were up in Japan (+7%), mainly due to supply of Ronapreve to the government, followed by sales growth of Evrysdi, Hemlibra, Polivy and Enspryng. This more than offset the impact of government price cuts and biosimilars.

Sales in the International region were stable. The impact of biosimilars and decline in sales of Actemra/RoActemra was compensated by Perjeta, Kadcyla, Hemlibra and Ocrevus sales.

The Diagnostics Division generated a 6% increase in sales to CHF 13.8 billion. The division’s base business continued its strong sales growth across all regions (+6%), with the largest contributions coming from the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific regions. Immunodiagnostic products were the main growth drivers.

As expected, the demand for COVID-19 tests declined sharply in the third quarter of 2022 (CHF 0.6 billion versus CHF 1.0 billion in the same period last year).

Sales in the Asia-Pacific and North America regions increased strongly, by 28% and 20%, respectively. The 13% decline in sales in the EMEA region is primarily due to the lower demand for COVID-19 tests.

Pharmaceuticals: key approvals and development milestones in the third quarter of 2022

Ophthalmology

In September, the European Commission (EC) approved Vabysmo, the first bispecific antibody for the eye. Vabysmo simultaneously targets and inhibits two disease pathways that drive neovascular or ‘wet’ age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and diabetic macular oedema (DME) – two of the leading causes of vision loss. With the potential to require fewer eye injections over time, while also improving and maintaining vision, Vabysmo could offer a less burdensome treatment schedule for individuals, their caregivers and healthcare systems.

Oncology

In August, the FDA accepted the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for the Polivy combination therapy for previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), an aggressive form of blood cancer. In four out of ten people with DLBCL, the cancer returns after initial treatment, at which point treatment options are limited and survival is short. Later in August, the Japanese health authorities granted approval for this Polivy combination in previously untreated DLBCL.

Also in August, Roche announced that the IMscin001 study met its co-primary endpoints. The study evaluated a subcutaneous formulation of cancer immunotherapy Tecentriq in people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Administered under the skin, this new formulation reduces the time spent receiving treatment to a matter of minutes, compared with up to an hour for an infusion.

Neuroscience

In October, Roche presented new data from its expanding neuromuscular disease portfolio. New two-year Evrysdi data show improvement or maintenance of motor function in people with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMA is a severe, progressive neuromuscular disease that can be fatal. It is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality.

In addition, data from the gene therapy EMBARK study for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most advanced phase III study currently underway, reinforces our confidence in the programme. DMD is a rare, progressive neuromuscular disease, leading to a loss of muscle function and premature death.

Virology

In August, the FDA approved Xofluza for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in otherwise healthy children aged five years and older. Historically, school-aged children have played a significant role in the community transmission of influenza. This approval marks the first single-dose oral influenza medicine approved in the US for children. Additionally, the FDA approved Xofluza for the prevention of influenza in children following contact with someone with influenza.

Diagnostics: key milestones in the third quarter of 2022

In July, the FDA granted Breakthrough Device Designation to the Elecsys Amyloid Plasma Panel, an innovative new solution that enables Alzheimer’s disease to be detected earlier. This panel measures two blood-based biomarkers, called pTau 181 and ApoE4. It has the potential to streamline a patient’s journey and increase the speed of diagnosis, giving people living with Alzheimer’s disease and their caregivers more time to plan and prepare for the future.

In August, Roche launched the Digital LightCycler System. This next-generation digital PCR system helps clinical researchers better understand the nature of a patient’s cancer, genetic disease or infection. It has the potential to find and quantify ultra-rare, hard-to-detect disease mutations, leading to early diagnosis and therapy decisions.

Every four minutes, one person dies from skin cancer. However, when detected early, localised melanoma is curable with a simple surgical excision. The newly launched PRAME (EPR20330) Antibody test evaluates PRAME protein expression from patients with suspected melanoma. Identifying this critical biomarker helps clinicians determine if their patient has melanoma.

Approximately half of all patients with metastatic breast cancer express low levels of HER2 receptor protein. The newly launched PATHWAY anti-HER2 (4B5) test is the only FDA-approved companion diagnostic indicated as an aid in the assessment of HER2 low status in these patients. Historically these patients have simply been classified as HER2-negative, leaving them with few treatment options. They may now be eligible for targeted therapy.

With the launch of additional COVID-19 tests, Roche also reinforced its position as a world-leading supplier of COVID-19 diagnostics:

The Elecsys IGRA SARS-CoV-2 test can help provide a deeper understanding of a person’s immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. It will serve as an additional tool to make better-informed decisions around care, sanitary measures and treatment options – particularly important for at-risk patient groups.

(The test was launched in countries that accept the CE Mark.)

can help provide a deeper understanding of a person’s immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. It will serve as an additional tool to make better-informed decisions around care, sanitary measures and treatment options – particularly important for at-risk patient groups. (The test was launched in countries that accept the CE Mark.) The next generation portfolio of SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen tests (“2.0”) for self-testing and professional use feature innovative updates and enhanced performance, building on insights gained throughout the pandemic.

(These tests are used under the CE mark.)

Based on continuous analysis performed since the onset of the pandemic, all Roche molecular tests detect all SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Pharmaceuticals sales: selected top-selling and new medicines

Ocrevus (first approved in 2017; CHF 4.4 billion, +17%). Relapsing and primary progressive forms of multiple sclerosis; two-hour-only infusion. The demand for this treatment in both indications remained strong. In Europe and the International region, Ocrevus continued to show a high uptake.

Perjeta (first approved in 2012; CHF 3.1 billion, +5%). HER2-positive breast cancer. Sales increased mostly due to the continuing high demand in the International region, mainly China.

Hemlibra (first approved in 2017; CHF 2.8 billion, +28%). Haemophilia A with and without factor VIII inhibitors; only prophylactic treatment that can be administered subcutaneously once weekly, every two or every four weeks. Sales continued to show a significant uptake, especially in the United States, Europe and the International region.

Tecentriq (first approved in 2016; CHF 2.7 billion, +10%). Cancer immunotherapy (either alone or in combinations) for various types of cancer, e.g. lung, bladder, breast and liver cancer. Sales increased mostly due to the higher demand in the United States and Europe. Sales in Japan decreased, primarily due to governmental price cuts.

Actemra/RoActemra2 (CHF 2.0 billion, -23%). Rheumatoid arthritis, forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and giant cell arteritis, CAR T-cell-induced severe or life-threatening cytokine release syndrome and COVID-19 pneumonia. COVID-19 related sales decreased, mainly in the United States and the International region.

Herceptin2 (CHF 1.7 billion, -18%). HER2-positive breast cancer and HER2-positive metastatic gastric cancer. The sales decrease was due to the biosimilar uptake in various countries.

Avastin2 (CHF 1.7 billion, -29%). Advanced colorectal, breast, lung, kidney, cervical and ovarian cancer, relapsed glioblastoma (a type of brain tumour) and liver cancer in combination with Tecentriq. Sales decreased because of the biosimilar uptake in various countries.

Xolair2 (CHF 1.6 billion, +10%, United States only). Chronic spontaneous urticaria and allergic asthma. Sales grew in the chronic spontaneous urticaria indication. Xolair remains the leading medicine in the larger allergic asthma indication.

MabThera/Rituxan2 (CHF 1.6 billion, -20%). Forms of blood cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and certain types of vasculitis. Sales decreased due to biosimilar erosion across all regions.

Kadcyla (first approved in 2013; CHF 1.6 billion, +11%). HER2-positive breast cancer. Sales growth was driven by the usage of Kadcyla in the early breast cancer setting. Sales also increased due to patients switching to this new standard care.

Alecensa (first approved in 2015; CHF 1.1 billion, +16%). ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. The global uptake continued with sales growth across all regions.

Lucentis2 (CHF 800 million, -25%, United States only). Eye conditions, including ‘wet’ age-related macular degeneration. Sales decreased primarily due to competitive pressure. The first biosimilar version of Lucentis (with a restricted label) came to market in the US at the beginning of the third quarter of 2022.

Evrysdi (first approved in 2020; CHF 793 million, +101%). Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in adults, children and babies. It is the first and only medicine for SMA that can be administered at home. Evrysdi continued to show a strong uptake across all regions, driven by Europe and the United States.

Ronapreve (first approved in 2021; CHF 631 million, -36%). Antibody combination for the prevention and treatment of recently diagnosed high-risk patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. The sales decline in Europe was partly compensated by the increase in Japan.

Esbriet (first approved in 2014; CHF 590 million, -25%). Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Sales decreased mainly because of the generic uptake, mainly in the United States. The first generic versions were launched in May 2022.

Gazyva/Gazyvaro (first approved in 2013; CHF 539 million, +8%). Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, rituximab-refractory follicular lymphoma and previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma. Approved as a shorter infusion time of 90 minutes, compared to the standard infusion of 3−4 hours.

Molecular Lab. Focuses on molecular labs; provides diagnostics solutions for pathogen detection and monitoring, donor screening, sexual health and genomics. Sales declined by 8%, mainly due to lower COVID-19-related sales in the North America and EMEA regions. This was partly offset by growth in the base business across the portfolio and by the GenMark and TIB Molbiol businesses, which were acquired in the previous year.

Diabetes Care. Focuses on integrated personalised diabetes management for people with diabetes and healthcare professionals. Sales decreased by 3% due to the base effect of the resolution of a rebate dispute in 2021. Excluding this effect, sales remained stable. The continued contraction of the blood glucose monitoring market, in particular in the US and in major European markets, was partly offset by higher demand in emerging markets.

Pathology Lab. Focuses on pathology labs; provides diagnostics solutions for tissue biopsies and companion diagnostics. These targeted diagnostics support the specific therapy decisions for each patient. Sales grew by 10% across all regions. The advanced staining and the companion diagnostics businesses were the main growth drivers.

https://www.centerforbiosimilars.com/view/genentech-roche-recalls-ophthalmology-biobetter-susvimo,"Genentech, Roche Recall Ophthalmology Biobetter Susvimo","Genentech, a member of the Roche group, announced a voluntariy recall of Susvimo, an ocular implant for ranibizumab injection that is a biobetter for Lucentis (ranibizumab), in the United States, according to a report from Ophthalmology Times.

Susvimo is an ocular implant of ranibizumab injection that is a biobetter of Lucentis (originator ranibizumab)

“The voluntary recall is based on recent testing of our commercial supply in which Susvimo implants were exposed to repeated puncturing with a needle…The results showed that some implants did not perform to our standards…. We deeply regret any disruption that this may cause to people with wet AMD and the retinal community,” Genentech explained in a statement.

Biobetters are a class of follow-on biologic products that are intentionally altered to improve clinical effects, allow for more time in between doses, or enhance tolerability.

Susvimo is used as an insertion tool for the treatment of people with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). Susvimo offers benefits over Lucentis in that Susvimo contains a reservoir of ranibizumab that can last for 6 months, enabling patients to require less trips to the doctor’s office over the course of a year, thereby increasing medication adherence and making it easier for patients to manage wet AMD. By contrast, regular injections of Lucentis or a ranibizumab biosimilar are required as often as once a month.

The product was approved by the FDA in October 2021. Following the approval, 2 ranibizumab biosimilars (Byooviz and Cimerli) referencing the originator (Lucentis) have enter the market, including one with an interchangeability designation (Cimerli). The approval of Susvimo raised concerns for biosimilar manufacturers, as many patients may be persuaded to switch from the originator to the ocular implant before patient have has the opportunity to try a biosimilar that is priced lower than both products.

4 Examples of Biobetters and the Products They're Based On

According to Roche’s most recent earnings report, Susvimo accumulated about $3 million in revenue over the last quarter. Additionally, Lucentis generated about $800 million in quarterly revenues, a 25% drop from the previous quarter, which the company attributed to the market introduction of Byooviz (ranibizumab-runa) at the beginning of the third quarter of 2022.

Genentech said that it has notified the FDA and is working with the agency on the recall process. It also claimed that it has taken “immediate steps to inform other health authorities, healthcare professionals, clinical trial investigators, and patient organizations” and it will offer support and guidance to help maintain clinical outcomes for patients. The company recommended that health care providers discuss the continuation of treatment with their patients who are treated with Susvimo and it said that it will be closely monitoring patients in line with FDA-approved label and clinical trial protocols.",['Skylar Jeremias'],

Roche Holding AG reported sales growth in 2022, but said it expects a decrease in sales for 2023 due to a drop in the sale of Covid-19 products.

The Swiss pharma major posted sales of 63.28 billion Swiss francs ($69.65 billion) for the full year 2022, up from CHF62.80 billion in 2021 and in line with consensus expectations. Net profit declined to CHF13.53 billion from CHF14.94 billion the year prior, missing analysts' expectations of CHF15.09 billion.

Core operating profit grew to CHF22.17 billion in the year from CHF21.90 billion the year prior, and core earnings per share also grew to CHF20.30 from CHF19.81 in 2021, the company said.

The company's pharmaceutical division increased sales slightly in 2022 on the back of newer medicines to treat severe diseases, it said. Sales of Covid-19 medicines were lower, and the drop in sales of Actemra/RoActemra to treat severe Covid-19 pneumonia was only partially made up by the sales growth of treatment Ronapreve in Japan, Roche said.

The company's diagnostics division also increased sales slightly, despite a decline in demand for Covid-19 tests in the second half of the year, it said.

For the year ahead, Roche expects a decrease in sales due to a previously announced CHF5 billion decline in Covid-19 product sales, it said. The expected sales drop is in the low-single digit at constant exchange rates. When excluding the Covid-19 sales decline, the company anticipates ""solid underlying sales growth"" in both its pharmaceutical and diagnostics division, it said.

Separately, Roche said it has appointed Teresa Graham as new chief executive officer for Roche Pharmaceuticals as of March 2023. Ms. Graham is currently head of global product strategy for Roche Pharmaceuticals. Levi Garraway, currently chief medical officer and executive vice president of Global Product Development, will become a member of the enlarged corporate executive committee, the company said.

New adjuvant treatments are urgently needed as an estimated 70-80% of people with early-stage HCC experience disease recurrence following surgery 1

Data will be discussed with health authorities globally, including the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency to inform the next regulatory steps, and presented at an upcoming medical meeting





Basel, 19 January 2023 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the Phase III IMbrave050 study met its primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival (RFS) at the prespecified interim analysis. The study is evaluating Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) in combination with Avastin® (bevacizumab) as adjuvant treatment following surgery for people with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at high risk of disease recurrence. The Tecentriq combination showed a statistically significant improvement in RFS in the intention-to-treat population of HCC patients who have an increased risk of recurrence following resection or ablation with curative intent, compared with active surveillance.

Overall survival data were immature at the time of interim analysis and follow-up will continue to the next analysis. Safety for Tecentriq and Avastin was consistent with the known safety profile of each therapeutic agent and with the underlying disease. Results from the IMbrave050 study will be discussed with health authorities, including the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, and presented at an upcoming medical meeting.

“Today, more than 70% of people with early-stage HCC may have their cancer return after surgery, which is associated with poorer prognosis and shorter survival. IMbrave050 is the first Phase III study to show that a cancer immunotherapy combination reduced the risk of disease returning in people with this type of HCC,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are excited by the clinical benefit that this adjuvant Tecentriq combination may bring to people with early liver cancer and look forward to seeing more mature data to further confirm the benefit.”

With liver cancer incidence increasing and mortality rates rising globally, effective treatments are urgently required.1-4 Roche is working in partnership with the community and leveraging its diagnostic and pharmaceutical expertise to develop solutions for patients that address unmet needs at each stage of liver cancer. IMbrave050 is part of Roche’s overall commitment to drive fundamental treatment change and improve outcomes for people living with liver cancer. In unresectable HCC (uHCC), for example, Tecentriq plus Avastin was the first treatment in over a decade to significantly improve overall survival over the existing standard of care, based on data from the IMbrave150 study. The Tecentriq combination quickly became a standard of care in uHCC and is clearly defined as a preferred front-line treatment in multiple international clinical guidelines.

Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies across different lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological, and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines, as well as studies in metastatic, adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings across various tumour types.

About the IMbrave050 study

IMbrave050 is a Phase III global, multicentre, open-label, randomised study evaluating the efficacy and safety of adjuvant Tecentriq plus Avastin, compared with active surveillance, in people with HCC at high risk of recurrence (determined by the size and number of cancerous lesions and the histopathology results, if available) after surgical resection or ablation with curative intent.

The study randomised 662 people with a ratio of 1:1 to receive either Tecentriq (1,200 mg every three weeks) plus Avastin (15 mg/kg every three weeks) for a maximum of 12 months, or no intervention with active surveillance. The primary endpoint is independent review facility-assessed RFS. Key secondary endpoints include overall survival, RFS as determined by the investigator and RFS in patients with PD-L1-positive disease.

About hepatocellular carcinoma

Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death and one of the few cancers where mortality is rising.3,4 More than 900,000 people are diagnosed with the disease globally each year, which translates to one person diagnosed every 90 seconds.3 Nine out of ten cases of HCC are caused by chronic liver disease, which includes chronic hepatitis B and C infection, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) and cirrhosis resulting from these conditions.5

If diagnosed in the early stage, surgery may be prescribed to remove the primary tumour, however an estimated 70-80% of people with early-stage HCC experience disease recurrence following surgery.1 Early recurrence is associated with poorer prognosis and shorter survival.1,2 Tumour size, number of tumours, and portal vein invasion are associated with an increased risk of recurrence.2

About Tecentriq

Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy approved for some of the most aggressive and difficult-to-treat forms of cancer. Tecentriq was the first cancer immunotherapy approved for the treatment of a certain type of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and HCC. Tecentriq is also approved in countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies, for various forms of metastatic NSCLC, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer, PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma.

Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. In addition to intravenous infusion, the formulation of Tecentriq is also being investigated as a subcutaneous injection to help address the growing burden of cancer treatment for patients and healthcare systems.

Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer and the cause of the most cancer-related deaths in women. Similarly, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, with more than 600,000 women diagnosed with the disease in 2020. Preventable through early HPV screening, cervical cancer is the number one cause of female cancer-related deaths in sub-Saharan Africa.

“In resource-constrained countries, mortality rates are higher as women are often diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer at a more advanced stage, when a positive outcome is less likely,” said Stefan Seliger, head global access & policy at Roche Diagnostics.

“This partnership will use the capabilities and expertise from both Roche and Jhpiego to identify and enhance ways to improve women’s health by removing barriers to early detection and treatment.”

Roche and Jhpiego will prioritize Africa and Asia

In the new partnership, Roche and Jhpiego will prioritize low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia, where the burden of breast and cervical cancers is highest. The initiative will take a multi-pronged approach to increase access to diagnostics and treatment. This will include offering technical and clinical guidance to local providers, and sharing evidence with local decision makers to support policy adoption and financing for education, screening and patient care programs.

The partnership will also support country programs to implement the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidelines for cervical screening, including the recommendation for an HPV DNA-based test as the preferred method4, and the WHO’s Global Breast Cancer Initiative to strengthen systems for detecting, diagnosing and treating breast cancer.

“We firmly believe that every woman should be empowered with the knowledge to understand the symptoms and risk of women’s cancers and have access to quality screening, detection, diagnosis and treatment. We are excited to partner with Roche and advance our complementary efforts towards reducing preventable deaths from women’s cancers,” said Leslie Mancuso, president and CEO of Jhpiego.

Starting in Ghana

The first initiative supported by the partnership will begin in Ghana in close collaboration with the Government of Ghana and relevant stakeholders to foster an integrated, resource-stratified women’s cancer care continuum in support of the Ghana National Strategy for Cancer Control.

Cancer is one of the most significant public health challenges in Ghana, and of all cancers, breast cancer is the most pervasive, accounting for more than 32 percent of all new cancer cases in Ghanian women in 20207.

Women in Ghana face multiple challenges to accessing quality breast and cervical health care during their patient journey, including health, mental, social and financial hurdles. Once symptomatic women encounter the health system, the disease is often already in an advanced stage. According to the Ghana National Strategy for Cancer Control 2012-2016, almost seven out of 10 women diagnosed with breast cancer each year in Ghana will die from their disease.

Roche and Jhpiego plan to support the Ministry of Health’s efforts through an integrated and scalable model that improves access to screening, early detection and treatment of women’s cancers.

The partnership is also exploring additional collaborations in Asia, such as in India and the Philippines, where breast and cervical cancer are the most common cancers among women.",['Jim Cornall'],2022-09-16 12:02:17+00:00

Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome Overview

Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome or syndromes (CAPS), also known as cryopyrinopathies, are genetic autoinflammatory syndromes defined by ‘gain-of-function’ mutations affecting the cryopyrin protein. Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes are all autosomal dominant genetic conditions, meaning only one copy of the abnormal gene is required to develop the clinical syndrome.

Cryoprin-Associated Periodic Syndrome Emerging Drugs

ZYIL 1 : Zydus Cadila

ZYIL1 is a novel oral small molecule NLRP3 inhibitor. It was found to be safe and well-tolerated in Phase I trials. Currently, it is in Phase II stage of development to treat Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes.

DFV890: Novartis Pharmaceuticals

DFV 890 is a NLRP3 protein inhibitor being developed by Novartis. Currently, it is in Phase II stage of development to treat Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes.

Zunsemetinib : Aclaris Therapeutics

Zunsemetinib is an investigational oral mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) inhibitor. This mechanism potentially leads to the inhibition of multiple cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteases and other inflammatory signals. Key inflammatory cytokines driven by this mechanism include tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin-1α, -1β, -6 and -8 (IL1α, IL1β, IL6 and IL8). Aclaris is developing zunsemetinib as a potential treatment for RA and other immuno-inflammatory diseases. Currently the drug is in phase 2 stage of development for the treatment of Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes.

IZD334: Inflazome

IZD334 is a NLRP3 protein inhibitors. Activated NLRP3 acts as a ‘danger sensor’ in the body to release the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-18 and induce uncontrolled, lytic cell death (pyroptosis). These processes lead to chronic inflammation, and as such, NLRP3 has been implicated in a large number of diseases. Acquisition of Inflazome had given Roche full rights to the Inflazome portfolio.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roche-receives-fda-approval-label-060000781.html,Roche receives FDA approval of label expansion for VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay to identify patients with locally advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer eligible for Libtayo,"The VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay helps determine which patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may be eligible for treatment with Libtayo monotherapy 1 based on the results of the Phase III EMPOWER-Lung 1 study.

This additional approval will allow more patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC broader access to the immunotherapy Libtayo.

PD-L1 testing provides clinicians with essential information that helps guide clinical decision making and improve patient outcomes.

TUCSON, Ariz., March 6, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay as a companion diagnostic to identify non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients eligible for treatment with Libtayo® (cemiplimab), a PD-1 inhibitor therapy developed by Regeneron.

More than 60 percent of patients diagnosed with NSCLC are diagnosed at locally advanced or metastatic stage (Stage III-IV).2 With this launch, more patients may have access to an additional immunotherapy option with Libtayo, potentially improving their treatment pathway and outcomes.

""Diagnostics, like our high medical value PD-L1 assay portfolio, enable personalised medicine to help improve patient outcomes,"" said Jill German, Head of Pathology Lab, Roche Diagnostics. ""This approval helps physicians make more confident treatment decisions by identifying patients with tumours that may respond to the immunotherapy Libtayo.""

The VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay is the only FDA approved product available with NSCLC indications for four different immunotherapy drugs, offering oncologists a broad range of treatment options for patients. Treating NSCLC as early as possible may improve patient outcomes.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Every year, more than 2.2 million people are diagnosed with lung cancer globally and up to 85 percent of these cases are NSCLC.3,4

Major Topics We Covered in this Study Report

GCC Oncology/Cancer Drugs Market Expensing Till 2028 –

The GCC Oncology/Cancer Drugs Market is projected to grow at a considerable CAGR during the forecast period, i.e., 2023-28. This is due to the rising incidences of patients diagnosed with cancer in the nations like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, etc., and the surging initiative to reduce the number of deaths due to cancer. As per the World Health Organization, a total of around 21.4% of breast cancer cases were reported in 2020 in the UAE, whereas the same around 14.5% of colorectal cancer, and nearly 12.5% of prostate cancer were reported among men in the country.

Industry Driving Factor –

The GCC nations have been witnessing a massive surge in several types of cancer cases including lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, etc. The prominent factor behind the increasing cases of lung cancer in the GCC nations remains the habit of tobacco smoking among the men population. The smoking prevalence has been subsequently leading to a large number of lung cancer cases mainly in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Oman. For instance, in 2020, around 6% male of Saudi Arabia were diagnosed with lung cancer, as per the World Health Organization. Thus, the growing prevalence of different types of cancers among the GCC population would facilitate the requirement for oncology/cancer drugs in the forthcoming period.

Available Growth Opportunity in the Market –

https://simplywall.st/stocks/ch/pharmaceuticals-biotech/vtx-rog/roche-holding-shares/news/the-total-return-for-roche-holding-vtxrog-investors-has-rise,The total return for Roche Holding (VTX:ROG) investors has risen faster than earnings growth over the last five years,"Roche Holding AG ( ) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 15% in the last quarter. But at least the stock is up over the last five years. However we are not very impressed because the share price is only up 31%, less than the market return of 36%. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 21% drop, in the last year.

Although Roche Holding has shed CHF8.7b from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns.

In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.

During five years of share price growth, Roche Holding achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 8.6% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 6% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.

The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).

It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free .

What About Dividends?

When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Roche Holding, it has a TSR of 53% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.

A Different Perspective

We regret to report that Roche Holding shareholders are down 19% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 8.3%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 9% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered that you should be aware of before investing here.

Of course Roche Holding may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free

Basel, 3 November 2022 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that it will present new data from its industry-leading haematology portfolio at the 64th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting from 10-13 December 2022. The data to be presented span numerous blood diseases, including haemophilia A, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), and various types of blood cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma. Roche’s approved and investigational medicines will be featured in more than 50 abstracts, including more than 15 oral presentations.

“We continually strive to improve patient outcomes by exploring new treatment options across blood disorders, such as lymphomas and rare blood diseases, where unmet needs remain high,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “The data we are presenting reinforce our ongoing commitment to redefining treatment paradigms, improving on existing standards of care and addressing a diversity of patient and healthcare system needs.”

Roche’s continued commitment to reinforcing strength of current portfolio

With 25 years of expertise in blood diseases, Roche has developed new medicines that changed the standard of care in several blood disorders with high unmet need. The data at this year’s meeting exemplify Roche’s commitment to investing in its current portfolio to further improve patient outcomes.

Interim data from the phase III HAVEN 7 study reinforce the efficacy and safety of Hemlibra® (emicizumab) in infants with severe haemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors. 1 For this population, early prophylaxis may prevent long-term damage to joints and muscles and potentially reduce the risk of intracranial haemorrhage, which can be life-threatening. 9

For this population, early prophylaxis may prevent long-term damage to joints and muscles and potentially reduce the risk of intracranial haemorrhage, which can be life-threatening. New data evaluating Polivy® (polatuzumab vedotin) that underscore the potential impact of this treatment for the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patient community will be shared at the meeting. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data from the phase III POLARIX study will be presented, highlighting the potential impact of Polivy in combination with MabThera®/Rituxan® (rituximab), cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (R-CHP) on reducing the need for subsequent treatments in people with previously untreated DLBCL, a population where multiple subsequent treatments can be a significant treatment burden. 2 Based on data from the POLARIX study, this Polivy combination has been approved in the EU and recently, Japan, for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated DLBCL.

Based on data from the POLARIX study, this Polivy combination has been approved in the EU and recently, Japan, for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated DLBCL. Roche is presenting updated data from the broadest and most comprehensive CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody development programme in the industry. This aims to provide off-the-shelf, fixed-duration treatment options, which address the unique and diverse needs of people with blood cancers. Data include updated analyses for Lunsumio® (mosunetuzumab), the first CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody approved by the European Commission to treat follicular lymphoma (FL), and glofitamab, for which data have been submitted for approval to the European Medicines Agency, and submissions to additional health authorities worldwide, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), are ongoing. An updated analysis from the pivotal phase II GO29781 study of Lunsumio in people with relapsed or refractory (R/R) FL after two or more prior therapies will show continued durable responses across multiple key efficacy endpoints in addition to offering the potential to be administered in an outpatient setting. 3 In addition, studies evaluating Lunsumio as a monotherapy and in novel combinations for the treatment of DLBCL in earlier lines of treatment will be presented, highlighting the potential of Lunsumio in other settings. 4,5 Updated results from the phase II NP30179 study will show a fixed course of glofitamab monotherapy can deliver durable complete responses in people with heavily pre-treated aggressive lymphomas. 6,7 Results from the pivotal R/R DLBCL cohort indicate patients can maintain durable responses following fixed-duration treatment with glofitamab, potentially allowing them to benefit from a treatment-free period. 6





Exploring and innovating in new areas of unmet need

Roche is applying its scientific expertise to expand its haematology clinical development programme by exploring additional blood diseases and bringing innovations that address the various needs of patients in areas of high unmet need.

The first phase III clinical data for crovalimab from the COMMODORE 3 study in China, will be presented at ASH. These data demonstrate that crovalimab met the co-primary efficacy endpoints, suggesting that crovalimab is efficacious and well-tolerated in people with PNH, a rare and life-threatening blood condition, where healthy red blood cells are targeted and destroyed by the body’s complement system. 8 There are currently no effective treatment options for PNH broadly available in China.

There are currently no effective treatment options for PNH broadly available in China. Spark Therapeutics, a member of the Roche Group, will share updated long-term follow-up data from the ongoing phase I/II clinical trial of SPK-8011, an investigational AAV-based gene therapy being developed for the treatment of haemophilia A. 1 0 The acquisition of Spark Therapeutics brought new capabilities in haemophilia A to address the high unmet medical need for people living with this disease and endeavour to create additional benefit beyond current treatment options.

The acquisition of Spark Therapeutics brought new capabilities in haemophilia A to address the high unmet medical need for people living with this disease and endeavour to create additional benefit beyond current treatment options. Positive data on cevostamab will be presented at ASH, including data from the phase I GO39775 study, which suggest that patients with heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma can maintain durable responses with fixed-duration cevostamab.11 Additionally, phase I data from Roche’s GPRC5DxCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody, RG6234, showing encouraging preliminary activity in people with R/R multiple myeloma, will be presented.12 With this pipeline, Roche is committed to advancing treatments for multiple myeloma, which remains an incurable disease characterised by multiple relapses.

Since being founded, Roche has worked to improve the health and lives of countless people across the globe. According to management, Roche’s 125th anniversary year was no exception: During 2021 the company’s more than 100,000 employees and Roche’s partners developed, manufactured, and provided worldwide access to state-of-the-art diagnostics and treatments for serious diseases including COVID-19. “These efforts were guided by the pioneering spirit that has characterized Roche since its founding,” company executives stated.

Roche itself was established under the effect of a pandemic, according to the company. “Fritz Hoffmann had just taken up a position as a merchant in Hamburg in the summer of 1892 when cholera broke out. As a result of this experience, he decided to set up an industrial pharmaceutical company on his return to Basel. His aim was to provide large quantities of effective medicines of uniform quality; this was still a revolutionary concept at the time. During the 126 years since its establishment, Roche has repeatedly found the courage to reinvent itself – guided by scientific progress.”

According to Roche Chairman Dr. Christoph Franz, “The impact of researchers such as Leo Sternbach, a Polish chemist, was enormous: In the 1960s he discovered the benzodiazepines Valium and Librium, which have become indispensable in the treatment of anxiety, insomnia and nervousness. Roche is still actively involved in the field of neuroscience. Ocrevus for the treatment of multiple sclerosis is one of our most sought-after medicinal products. Further milestones in our company’s history include our early adoption of biotechnology at a time when almost nobody believed in it. We used the discovery of monoclonal antibodies to revolutionize cancer therapy. With our PCR technology, we were also pioneers in molecular diagnostics.”

Roche Group CEO Dr. Severin Schwan stated, “Improving people’s lives by delivering medical innovations – that is what Roche has been about for 126 years now. Many of our medicines which were developed decades ago are still greatly benefiting millions of people today. The World Health Organization’s Model List of Essential Medicines includes 32 of our products – a record high.”

Schwan continues, “In the future, too, Roche’s success will be based on medical innovations. Despite all the successes, there is still a great need for better therapies in many areas, such as cancer, dementia and infections, far beyond COVID-19. A need for effective treatments to give people with serious diseases a better life or even cure them, a need for precision diagnostics to find the cause of a disease and treat it at the earliest possible stage. Preventive diagnostics are also gaining increasing significance.”

According to Schwan, “Looking ahead, I am pleased with the continued high demand for our newly launched medicines and diagnostic tests as well as the development of our product pipelines in both divisions.”

Financial & Product performance

Group sales for Roche during first-half 2022 increased 5 percent year-over-year at constant exchange rates (CER) and 5 percent in Swiss francs to CHF 32.3 billion ($35.32 billion). According to Roche, the improvement was mainly driven by the Diagnostics Division, with sales growth of COVID-19-related products and growth in routine testing across all regions. For the Pharmaceuticals Division, sales grew due to the continuing uptake of new medicines, which offset the negative impact from biosimilar competition.

Core operating profit growth of 9 percent was reported for the first six months of 2022. The 9 percent year-over-year improvement reflected the sales growth and additionally the income from the Ultomiris patent settlement.

IFRS net income grew 12 percent (12 percent in Swiss francs), and core earnings per share increased 11 percent compared to first-half 2021. Roche said these increases included positive impacts of 3 percentage points from the Ultomiris patent settlement, net of tax, and 6 percentage points from the share repurchase from Novartis, net of additional financing costs and tax. Roche reported operating free cash flow of CHF 9.78 billion ($10.7 billion), up 21 percent versus first-half 2021, due to the higher cash generation of the business including the Ultomiris patent settlement. Free cash flow amounted to CHF 7.1 billion ($7.76 billion), an increase of 18 percent, due to the growth in the operating free cash flow.

Pharmaceuticals Division sales during the 2022 first half grew 3 percent at CER to CHF 22.35 billion ($24.44 billion). According to Roche, growth was aided by continued strong demand for new medicines to treat severe diseases. The improved performance was fueled by growing demand for Hemlibra (emicizumab), Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), Evrysdi (risdiplam), Phesgo (pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf) and Tecentriq (atezolizumab), which combined contributed an additional CHF 1.5 billion (CER, $1.64 billion) of sales. Rituxan/MabThera (rituximab), Herceptin (trastuzumab) and Avastin (bevacizumab) sales declined by a combined CHF 1.0 billion (CER, $1.09 billion), as the impact of biosimilar competition further slowed down.

Diagnostics Division sales for the January–June 2022 period rose 11 percent at CER to nearly CHF 9.95 billion ($10.88 billion), helped by an ongoing strong base business. Total sales of COVID-19-related tests (at CER), notably Roche’s SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen test, amounted to CHF 3.1 billion ($3.39 billion) during first-half 2022. Management said demand for COVID-19 tests was expected to decrease in the second half of 2022. Sales in the division’s base business rose 6 percent at CER, led by the immunodiagnostics business, with cardiac tests being a key contributor.

Upon announcing the first-half 2022 results, Roche said full-year sales were expected to be stable or grow in the low-

single digits (at constant exchange rates). Core earnings per share were targeted to increase in the low- to mid-single digit range (at constant exchange rates), including the accretive effect of the 2021 share repurchase. Management expects to further increase Roche’s dividend in Swiss francs.

Roche anticipates sales of COVID-19 medicines and diagnostics to decrease by CHF 2 billion ($2.19 billion) to around CHF 5 billion ($5.47 billion), and sales losses due to biosimilars in the current year to be roughly CHF 2.5 billion ($2.73 billion). Excluding those effects, Group sales are expected to grow in the high-single digit range.

Product approvals & pipeline updates

Roche’s pharmaceutical clinical pipeline of about 80 new molecular entities encompasses a broad range of diseases, and highly innovative technologies are applied to create and produce the active molecules.

Oncology is the primary area of research and development for Roche. According to management, the company has one of the industry’s broadest and most comprehensive oncology pipelines and portfolios.

In the second quarter of 2022, Roche attained various milestones in the challenging area of blood cancers. Roche’s Q2 approvals included the EU marketing clearances of Polivy (first-line treatment for aggressive form of blood cancer), Lunsumio (follicular lymphoma) and Tecentriq (early-stage lung cancer). Also, an EU marketing authorization application was filed for glofitamab (blood cancer).

The European Commission (EC) in May 2022 approved the Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin-piiq) combination therapy for individuals with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This represents the first therapy in more than 20 years to significantly improve outcomes in this aggressive form of blood cancer.

During August 2022, the FDA accepted Roche’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Polivy in combination with Rituxan plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (R-CHP) as a treatment for people with previously untreated DLBCL. The U.S. regulatory agency is expected to make an approval decision by April 2, 2023. Polivy represents the first new treatment regimen in more than 20 years to significantly improve outcomes in people with DLBCL, a fast-growing form of lymphoma.

Polivy represents a first-in-class anti-CD79b antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). The CD79b protein is expressed specifically in the majority of B-cells, an immune cell impacted in some forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), making Polivy a promising target for the development of new medicines.

Various combination trials with Polivy and Roche’s CD20xCD3 bispecifics in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are under way. Theses studies include testing combinations of Polivy with Roche’s CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies Lunsumio (mosunetuzumab) and glofitamab, and with Rituxan in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin in the Phase III POLARGO trial.

The EC in June approved the first-in-class bispecific antibody Lunsumio for relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL). Soon after, the FDA granted priority review for this innovative medicine. Lunsumio is a new type of immunotherapy that is a chemotherapy-free, fixed-duration treatment option that could improve outcomes for people who have relapsed or are refractory to multiple prior treatments.

During July 2022, the FDA granted Priority Review to Lunsumio for people with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma upon accepting Roche’s Biologics License Application (BLA). The potential first-in-class CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody is intended for treating adults with relapsed or refractory (R/R) FL who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. An FDA decision regarding the approval of this novel cancer immunotherapy for this indication is anticipated by December 29, 2022.

A first-in-class CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody, Lunsumio is designed to target CD20 on the surface of B-cells and CD3 on the surface of T-cells. This dual targeting activates and redirects a patient’s existing T-cells to engage and eliminate target B-cells by releasing cytotoxic proteins into the B-cells, according to Roche. A robust clinical development program is under way, testing the molecule as a monotherapy and in combination with other medicines, for treating people with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and other blood cancers.

Tecentriq during June was cleared for marketing by the EC for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (eNSCLC). Tecentriq is the first cancer immunotherapy available for the adjuvant treatment of certain people with eNSCLC in Europe. According to Roche, half of all people with eNSCLC develop recurrence after surgery, which in some cases is no longer curable. Treating this cancer at an earlier stage provides the best chance to prevent recurrence.

In August, Roche reported that the subcutaneous formulation of Tecentriq showed positive Phase III results. The IMscin001 trial demonstrated non-inferior levels of the cancer immunotherapy Tecentriq in the blood, when injected subcutaneously, versus intravenous infusion, in people with advanced NSCLC. Administered under the skin, the subcutaneous form reduces time spent receiving treatment to just minutes, versus up to an hour for IV infusion.

The monoclonal antibody Tecentriq is designed to bind with a protein called programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is expressed on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. The investigational subcutaneous form joins together Tecentriq with Halozyme Therapeutics’ Enhanze drug delivery technology.

The intravenous version of Tecentriq is approved for some of the most aggressive and difficult-to-treat types of cancer. IV Tecentriq was the first cancer immunotherapy cleared for approval for treating a certain form of early-stage NSCLC, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). IV Tecentriq is additionally approved in various countries, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies, for different types of metastatic NSCLC, certain forms of metastatic urothelial cancer, PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. and BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma.

The potential first-in-class bispecific antibody glofitamab may improve the lives of people with the aggressive blood cancer DLBCL. Roche submitted glofitamab for approval to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

Data presented for the first time at ASCO and EHA 2022 demonstrate glofitamab induces high and durable complete response rates in people with heavily pre-treated DLBCL. Roche said glofitamab has the potential to offer a readily available, fixed-duration CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody treatment approach for people with aggressive lymphoma.

Glofitamab is a member of the company’s industry-leading CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody development program, which aims to address the diverse needs and preferences of people with blood cancers. Roche is evaluating the molecule as a monotherapy and in combination with other medicines, for treating B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including DLBCL and mantle cell lymphoma, and other blood cancers.

Glofitamab is based on a novel structural format known as ‘2:1’. Glofitamab is engineered to have two ‘Fab’ regions that bind to CD20, and one ‘Fab’ region that binds to CD3. As a result, this dual targeting activates and redirects a patient’s existing T-cells to engage and eliminate target B-cells by releasing cytotoxic proteins into the B-cells.

Roche reported during May 2022 initial results from the first interim analysis of the SKYSCRAPER-01 trial in PD-L1-high metastatic NSCLC. Tiragolumab in combination with Tecentriq did not meet the study’s co-primary endpoint of progression-free survival. The clinical trial will continue for the co-primary endpoint of overall survival to mature, which is a decisive factor in this setting, Roche said. Tiragolumab continues to be assessed in NSCLC and other cancer types via additional Phase III studies.

The novel immune checkpoint inhibitor tiragolumab has an intact Fc region. Research shows tiragolumab selectively binds to TIGIT, a novel inhibitory immune checkpoint, which suppresses the immune response to cancer. Tiragolumab is believed to work as an immune amplifier with other cancer immunotherapies such as Tecentriq.

Roche is developing the oncology drug giredestrant, an oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD). A Phase II trial of giredestrant met the study’s primary endpoint in the most frequently diagnosed type of breast cancer, as reported by Roche in December 2021. The drug candidate demonstrated statistically superior anti-proliferative activity versus standard-of-care treatment (anastrozole) in neoadjuvant estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.

As giredestrant continues to show a tolerable safety profile, Roche advanced the product into the Phase III lidERA Breast Cancer trial for the adjuvant treatment of ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, as part of a comprehensive clinical development program. Giredestrant has received U.S. Fast Track Designation (FTD) as a second-line and third-line treatment for ER-positive, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer.

The potent, next-generation investigational selective estrogen receptor (SERD) giredestrant has best-in-class potential, according to Roche. Administered orally, giredestrant delivers an encouraging clinical efficacy and safety profile and has demonstrated superior pre-clinical potency over other SERDs in development.

Eight-year data from the APHINITY trial demonstrated Roche’s Perjeta-based regimen continues to reduce the risk of disease returning for people with HER2-positive early breast cancer. Results at 8.4 years median follow-up (101 months) demonstrated the continued benefit of the combination of Perjeta (pertuzumab), Herceptin (trastuzumab) and chemotherapy (the Perjeta-based regimen), compared to Herceptin, chemo and placebo, when administered as post-surgery (adjuvant) intravenous (IV) treatment for people with lymph node (LN)-positive, HER2-positive early breast cancer, who are at high risk of recurrence. Roche said the greatest benefit continued to be seen in people who are at a high risk of recurrence (those with lymph node-positive disease).

Perjeta targets the HER2 receptor, a protein located on the outside of many normal cells and in high quantities on the outside of cancer cells in HER2-positive cancers. The medicine is designed specifically to prevent the HER2 receptor from pairing (or ‘dimerizing’) with other HER receptors (EGFR/HER1, HER3 and HER4) on cell surfaces, a process that is believed to play a role in tumor growth and survival. Binding of Perjeta to HER2 may additionally signal the body’s immune system to destroy the cancer cells. The mechanisms of action of Perjeta and Herceptin are believed to complement each other, as each bind to the HER2 receptor, but to different locations. The Perjeta-Herceptin combo is believed to provide a more comprehensive, dual blockade of HER signaling pathways, thus preventing tumor cell growth and survival.

Neuroscience represents another major focus of R&D at Roche. Management says the company’s goal is to pursue groundbreaking science to develop new treatments that help improve the lives of people with chronic and potentially devastating diseases.

Roche is investigating more than one dozen products for neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and autism spectrum disorder. “Together with our partners, we are committed to pushing the boundaries of scientific understanding to solve some of the most difficult challenges in neuroscience today,” according to Roche.

One of the lead stories of Roche’s product performance during 2022 was the U.S. approval of Evrysdi in May for babies under 2 months of age with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Roche said this approval is particularly significant, as early treatment of SMA – before symptoms start to appear – can help babies achieve motor milestones. The marketing clearance is based on interim RAINBOWFISH data demonstrating pre-symptomatic babies treated with Evrysdi for at least one year were able to sit, stand, and walk. The drug’s prescribing information was updated with FIREFISH data demonstrating the majority of symptomatic babies treated with Evrysdi for at least two years could sit for at least five seconds.

Also, the company announced new three-year data from the FIREFISH study, reinforcing the long-term efficacy and safety of Evrysdi in infants with symptomatic type 1 SMA.

Roche announced clinical trial results of crenezumab in June 2022. The study assessed the potential of crenezumab to slow or prevent Alzheimer’s disease in cognitively unimpaired people who carry a specific genetic mutation that causes early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. While the treatment did not show a statistically significant clinical benefit, Roche is “confident that the rich data collected will enhance the broader scientific community’s knowledge of Alzheimer’s disease as well as support future research efforts in the field.”

Data presented for Ocrevus during April 2022 demonstrated benefit in disability progression and cognitive decline in secondary progressive and primary progressive multiple sclerosis. The data showed 75 percent of patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS) achieved no evidence of progression (NEP) in a one-year interim analysis of the CONSONANCE study. Also, 70 percent of patients with SPMS and PPMS showed stable or improved cognition after one year of Ocrevus treatment in CONSONANCE. A separate analysis on treatment disparities demonstrated fewer Black and Hispanic patients with MS initiate high-efficacy treatments within two years of diagnosis The clinical data support the body of evidence for Ocrevus more than 450,000 patient years and over 225,000 patients treated worldwide.

Ocrevus is the first therapy approved for both RMS (including RRMS, active SPMS and CIS in the United States) and PPMS, with six-month dosing. The humanized monoclonal antibody is designed to target CD20-positive B cells, a specific form of immune cell believed to be a key contributor to myelin (nerve cell insulation and support) and axonal (nerve cell) damage. This nerve cell damage can result in disability in people with MS.

New data reported by Roche in July 2022 from the Phase III HAVEN 6 trial reinforce the favorable safety and efficacy profile of Hemlibra in people with moderate or mild hemophilia A. According to the study results, Hemlibra continues to show clinically meaningful bleed control, with 66.7 percent of participants with moderate or mild hemophilia A experiencing zero treated bleeds at 55.6 weeks median follow-up. The data additionally reinforce Hemlibra’s favorable safety profile, with no new safety signals observed, according to Roche.

Hemlibra is approved for treating people of all ages with hemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors in more than 110 countries and for people of all ages without factor VIII inhibitors in 95-plus countries. The bispecific factor IXa- and factor X-directed antibody is designed to bring together factor IXa and factor X, proteins involved in the natural coagulation cascade, and restore the blood-clotting process for individuals with hemophilia A.

The prophylactic (preventative) treatment Hemlibra was created by Chugai Pharmaceutical and is being jointly developed worldwide by Chugai, Roche and Genentech. The product is marketed in the United States by the Roche subsidiary Genentech as Hemlibra (emicizumab-kxwh), with kxwh as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the FDA.

During September 2022, the EC approved Vabysmo (faricimab) as a treatment for neovascular or ‘wet’ age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema (DME). Roche said these retinal conditions are two of the leading causes of vision loss globally, affecting more than 40 million people. Vabysmo is approved in the European Union and nine other countries, including the United States, Japan, and the UK, with filings to other regulatory authorities under way.

Vabysmo is the only injectable eye medicine available in Europe with Phase III trials supporting treatment at intervals of up to four months for people living with nAMD and DME. The bispecific antibody is uniquely engineered to target and inhibit two disease pathways, linked to various vision-threatening retinal conditions, by neutralizing angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), to restore vascular stability.

During February 2022, two-year clincial data were presented for Vabysmo and Susvimo (previously called Port Delivery System with ranibizumab) reinforcing the potential to maintain vision with fewer treatments for people with DME and nAMD. These longer-term results from the Vabysmo YOSEMITE and RHINE clinical trials in DME and the Susvimo Archway study in nAMD further reinforce the potential to allow for longer time between treatments and fewer eye injections for people with these conditions, while still achieving and maintaining vision gains evident with previous standard-of-care injections.

The refillable eye implant Susvimo is surgically inserted into the eye during a one-time, outpatient procedure. The implant continuously delivers a customized formulation of ranibizumab over time. According to Roche, Susvimo is indicated for intravitreal use via the eye implant only. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor ranibizumab is designed to bind to and inhibit VEGF-A, a protein that has been demonstrated to play a critical role in the formation of new blood vessels and the leakiness of the vessels.

Roche says Susvimo is different from the ranibizumab intravitreal injection, a blockbuster medicine marketed by the company as Lucentis (ranibizumab injection), which is approved for treating nAMD and other retinal diseases. Lucentis was initially approved for nAMD by the FDA during 2006.

Roche’s Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) won marketing clearance during August 2022 as the only single-dose oral medicine for treating influenza to be approved in the United States for children as young as 5 years of age. The FDA additionally approved Xofluza to prevent influenza in children aged 5 years and older following contact with an infected person.

Xofluza was previously approved by the FDA to treat influenza in people 12 years of age and older who have had influenza symptoms for no more than 48 hours and who are otherwise healthy or at high risk of developing influenza-related complications. Available as a one-dose, single-tablet, the product is also approved for the prevention of influenza in people 12 years of age and older following contact with someone with influenza (known as post-exposure prophylaxis).

COVID-19 therapeutics & Tests

Roche is deeply dedicated to supporting the worldwide response to put an end to the COVID-19 pandemic, management says. Around the globe, the company is “working with urgency, passion and purpose each and every day to deliver high-quality tests that are essential for healthcare systems and patients alike.”

Roche was issued FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) during June 2022 for the company’s cobas SARS-CoV-2 Duo, the first PCR test to detect the COVID-19 virus and simultaneously measure the viral load in an individual. The test assists healthcare providers with contact tracing, patient triage, therapy and monitoring.

Roche launched a new diagnostic test for the better understanding of immune response to SARS-CoV-2 during August 2022. According to Roche, Elecsys IGRA SARS-CoV-2 test supports the better understanding of immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. The test detects T-cell response, which may play a significant role in determining if immune protection has been achieved. The new diagnostic test may provide clinical care guidance, especially for immunocompromised and high-risk patient groups.

The FDA granted priority review during April 2022 to Actemra/RoActemra (tocilizumab) for treating COVID-19 in hospitalized adults. If cleared for marketing, Actemra/RoActemra would be the first U.S. FDA-approved immunomodulator for treating COVID-19 in hospitalized patients.

Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA was received in June 2021 for Actemra/RoActemra, which is approved for marketing in at least 16 countries for defined patients hospitalized with severe or critical COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) during February 2022 prequalified Actemra/RoActemra for patients with severe or critical COVID-19, supporting access to care in low-income and middle-income countries.

Beyond COVID-19, Actemra/RoActemra was the first humanized interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist approved for treating adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have used one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate (MTX), that did not provide enough relief.

Non-COVID Diagnostic launches & updates

For Roche’s Diagnostics business, among the 2022 highlights have been the launches of innovative platforms and systems for tissue-based cancer diagnostics, of HPV self-sampling solution and monkeypox virus test kits. According to Roche, diagnostic tools are critical for responding to and ultimately controlling emerging public health challenges.

Roche and the company’s subsidiary within the Diagnostics division, TIB Molbiol, in May 2022 swiftly developed three unique PCR LightMix Modular Virus test kits that detect the monkeypox virus and aid in tracking its epidemiologic spread. Roche executives said use of these new research test kits evaluate the spread of the virus and can help monitor the potential impact of therapeutics, vaccines, and public health interventions.

During March 2022, Roche and TIB Molbiol announced available testing solutions that can identify the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 variant and differentiate between the Omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.2.2, BA.3 and Delta. According to Roche, use of these tests evaluate the spread of circulating variants and can help monitor the potential impact of therapeutics, vaccines and public health interventions. Every Roche SARS-Cov-2 test correctly identifies the virus including these new subvariants, the company said.

Roche introduced during August 2022 a next-generation digital PCR system, a powerful new diagnostics platform in the fight against cancer and other diseases. The Digital LightCycler System helps clinical researchers better understand the nature of a patient’s cancer, genetic disease or infection.

According to Roche, the new system has the potential to find and quantify ultra-rare, hard-to-detect mutations, resulting in early diagnosis and treatment strategies. The system is designed for laboratories performing highly sensitive and precise DNA and RNA analysis in areas such as oncology and infectious diseases.

More than 600,000 women around the globe are diagnosed with cervical cancer annually, and over half die from the disease. According to Roche, cervical cancer is caused by infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) and is preventable with timely diagnosis. During June 2022, the company introduced a self-sampling solution for the cobas HPV test in countries accepting the CE mark. Enabling women to self-collect their own specimens for HPV testing is a critical step in the fight against cervical cancer, Roche said.

Additionally in June, Roche announced the CE launch of the Ventana DP 600. The high-capacity slide scanner produces high-resolution, digital images of stained tissue samples that aid in the diagnosis of cancer.

Ventana DP 600 also enables better and more personalized healthcare. In combination with Roche’s AI image analysis algorithms, this solution can help ensure that each patient receives the most effective treatment plan possible.

Roche also launched the advanced tissue staining platform BenchMark Ultra Plus during June. This system allows pathologists to provide quick and accurate results that help inform patient treatment options.

The company introduced during July 2022 Elecsys HCV Duo, the first commercially available diagnostic test for the simultaneous and independent determination of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) antigen and antibody status. About 60 million people around the globe live with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection, but only one in five is aware of it.

At the beginning of 2022, Roche introduced the cobas pulse system, an industry-first professional blood glucose management solution with mobile digital health capabilities to improve patient care. The handheld blood glucose management device is designed around the specific needs of healthcare professionals working in various care settings. Roche said this is the first diagnostic solution at the point of care to serve as a digital platform connecting developers of digital health software and applications to HCPs. The new system simplifies workflows and equips HCPs with valuable clinical insights to deliver better patient care.

Also during January, Roche launched cobas infinity edge, a new open digital ecosystem for point of care (POC) professionals, driving improved patient outcomes and operational efficiencies in healthcare.

The disappointing results for Roche put increased focus on late-stage Alzheimer's drugs from Biogen/Eisai (lecanemab) and Eli Lilly (Donanemab).​​

Roche, meanwhile, says it remains committed to Alzheimer’s disease: highlighting its pipeline of investigational medicines for different targets, types and stages of the disease; and the potential learnings from its gantenreumab data.

Clinical decline was not statistically significant

Gantenerumab is a fully-human monoclonal IgG1 antibody designed to target and bind to aggregated forms of beta-amyloid, including oligomers, fibrils and plaques, and activate immune cells in the brain (microglia) to clear amyloid plaques and prevent further accumulation. Gantenerumab was discovered in collaboration with MorphoSys.

The Graduate I and Graduate II studies evaluated gantenerumab in a study group of 1,965 people with early Alzheimer’s disease over 27 months: with half receiving a subcutaneous injection titrated to reach a target dose of 510mg administered every two weeks and the other half receiving a placebo.

The CDR-SB measures cognitive & functional change across 6 areas: memory, orientation, judgement / problem solving, community affairs, home & hobbies, and personal care.

Study participants showed a slowing of clinical decline of -0.31 (p=0.0954), and -0.19 (p=0.2998) respectively from baseline score on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), however, neither was statistically significant.

This represents a relative reduction in clinical decline of 8% in Graduate I and 6% in Graduate II compared with placebo.

The level of beta-amyloid removal, the protein that builds up to make plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, was lower than expected.

The incidence of ARIA-E (oedema or effusion) in the pooled gantenerumab arms was 25%, with the ‘vast majority being asymptomatic and very few leading to treatment discontinuation’. The incidence of isolated ARIA-H (haemosiderin) was balanced across the gantenerumab and placebo groups.

Roche will present topline findings of the trials at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) Conference on Wednesday, 30 November.

“So many of our families have been directly affected by Alzheimer’s, so this news is very disappointing to deliver,”​ said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development, commenting on the data.

“We are profoundly grateful to the study participants, their care partners and study sites for their contributions to this research. ​

""While the Graduate results are not what we hoped, we are proud to have delivered a high quality, clear and comprehensive Alzheimer’s dataset to the field, and we look forward to sharing our learnings with the community as we continue to search for new treatments for this complex disease.”​

Potential insights towards accessible and affordable treatments

The Alzheimer’s Association notes several areas for such learnings which could inform future drug development.

“There were several innovative aspects of these gantenerumab trials,"" ​says the organization.

""For example, the treatment was delivered by injection under the skin rather than an infusion directly into a vein, and the drug was administered with half the dose delivered twice per month, rather than the whole monthly dose given at one time. ​

""These features could make it possible to have a more accessible and affordable treatment that can be administered in a doctor’s office and perhaps even at home. ​

""The hope is that this method, which is also being tested in other treatments, will be just as effective, more convenient and reduce potential travel-related hardships on people living with Alzheimer’s, their caregivers and family members.​

“The global Graduate trials included local study sites in 32 countries, and we look forward to learning more about the representation in the trials in the coming weeks. It is imperative that clinical trials do more to reflect the global population and those most impacted by Alzheimer’s disease.”​",['Rachel Arthur'],2022-11-14 00:00:00

https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/events/company-events/roche-sets-gantenerumab-expectations,Roche sets the gantenerumab expectations,"With results of Roche’s pivotal gantenerumab studies, Graduate 1 and 2, now the hottest remaining catalyst of 2022, analysts are frantically crunching various scenarios. One possibility is that just one of the two studies succeeds, and on today’s third-quarter call Roche confirmed that this scenario would not preclude US regulatory filing.

This could be an important concession from a company that has tended to shy away from the sort of torturing of clinical data that saw Biogen’s Aduhelm controversially approved last year. Attention now falls on next month’s CTAD conference, at which the full study results are to be presented, and on topline data, to be put out by Roche press release at some point before.

It was perhaps disappointing that Roche was unable to reveal the results today, but this did not stop every analyst from asking about gantenerumab. Most importantly, the group’s outgoing chief executive, Severin Schwan, stated: “We do not yet have any (Graduate 1 and 2) results in house.”

But in response to questioning he confirmed that a pooled analysis of the trials was planned. Thus, if one study was positive and the other negative, and the pooled analysis suggested a “directionally positive” effect, this would present a path forward for US filing.

Mr Schwan also said the results would come simultaneously, so there was no risk of Roche sitting on some data while it awaited the rest. Such considerations might seem trifling, but they became key when Eisai/Biogen’s lecanemab unexpectedly rekindled the amyloid hypothesis last month; full data from the latter’s Clarity AD trial are also due at CTAD.

Similarities... and differences

Indeed, lecanemab’s success has largely stirred enthusiasm about gantenerumab. And there are enough similarities between the two molecules for some to see a positive read-across for Roche – as well as equally important differences that urge caution. Biogen’s Aduhelm, approved on the basis of two failed pivotal trials, from one of which a purported success was later teased out, gives an added dimension.

Still, until CTAD itself, or at least until Roche press releases the topline Graduate 1 and 2 data, all the markets can do is guess.

For the speculators, one similarity between lecanemab and gantenerumab is that both pivotal programmes had been launched after analysis of earlier negative trials suggested a path forward. Lecanemab had failed Study 201’s primary endpoint, 12-month change in Adcoms score, but a Bayesian analysis teased out a benefit for the highest, 10mg/kg every two weeks, at 18 months.

In Roche’s case two large gantenerumab trials had drawn a blank: Scarlet Road was halted in late 2014 after failing its primary endpoint, CDR-SB, and then recruitment into Marguerite Road was halted. But these two trials tested relatively low gantenerumab doses, 105mg or 225mg every four weeks, and an open-label extension then took place, dosing the MAb up to 1.2g per month.

It was this that showed some efficacy on plaque reduction, and on the strength of this Graduate 1 and 2 were launched. Both the two new pivotal studies effectively test a 1.02g gantenerumab monthly dose (either every four weeks or at 510mg every two weeks), the theory being that amyloid-beta MAbs have to be dosed much higher than before, and in many more patients, to have a shot at showing efficacy.

One obvious question is whether Roche has now indeed dosed gantenerumab high enough, and whether such dosing can be maintained without triggering the notorious Aria-E side effect. Importantly, the result of Eisai/Biogen’s Clarity AD study largely justified the move to press on on the basis of a purported benefit backing lecanemab’s high dose.

Protofibrils?

On a mechanistic level, lecanemab and gantenerumab both appear to target regions of amyloid-beta that include amino acid position 22, which lecanemab’s originator, Bioarctic, had found to increase the formation of large soluble oligomers called protofibrils. But only lecanemab was designed specifically with protofibrils in mind, whereas gantenerumab (and Aduhelm) target amyloid-beta more generally.

As for dosing, it will be noted that the pivotal trials use relatively high monthly dose levels – 10mg/kg of lecanemab every two weeks (so effectively around 1.6g per month) in Clarity AD, and 1.02g in the Graduate programme – and both involve roughly 2,000 patients with early Alzheimer’s, with the amyloid-beta MAb being compared against placebo.

But all is not so simple. Each molecule has its own bioavailability profile, and on top of this lecanemab is given IV whereas gantenerumab is subcutaneous. While the two pivotal programmes have broadly similar key endpoints, lecanemab’s were tested at 18 months, whereas gantenerumab’s are set at 27 months; if it is true that an effect develops over time this clearly favours the Roche project.

Of course, the Eisai/Biogen MAb faces questions of its own. What is the absolute effect on CDR-SB, what does this mean in terms of a real benefit for Alzheimer’s patients, how convincingly were key secondaries hit, and to what extent might unblinding have affected the outcome? All will be revealed, for lecanemab and gantenerumab, at CTAD.",[],2022-10-18 00:00:00

https://en.hdbuzz.net/335,Forward momentum for Roche and Wave in latest news about huntingtin-lowering trials,"By Dr Jeff Carroll and Dr Leora Fox Edited by Dr Rachel Harding

In the past week or so, during and following a big HD research conference, two companies developing medicines for Huntington’s disease announced news about their huntingtin-lowering drugs. First, the pharmaceutical company Roche announced plans for a new clinical trial of tominersen. Then, the genetic medicines company Wave Life Sciences shared early data showing that its drug WVE-003 seems to be hitting the right target in the first human trial participants. Both of these drugs are delivered via spinal injection and are known as ASOs. Let’s talk about the history and the caveats surrounding these hopeful pieces of news.

Updates from Roche

First, let’s recap Roche’s work in HD research in recent years. Roche had been running a global clinical trial, GENERATION-HD1, starting in 2019, to test a drug called tominersen in people with HD. This was a Phase 3 trial, a big study designed to determine whether a drug can slow or stop the progression of HD symptoms. An earlier, shorter trial, run by Ionis Pharmaceuticals had already shown that tominersen appeared safe and that it could lower the amount of huntingtin protein in the spinal fluid of people with HD.

Roche has been busy analyzing the data from GENERATION-HD1, to try and understand what went wrong, and whether there might be a future for tominersen in HD.

The 800 participants with HD in GENERATION-HD1 hailed from all over the globe, and were split into three groups, known as cohorts. One group received tominersen via spinal injection every 8 weeks, one every 16 weeks, and one received placebo (spinal injections but no drug). Their participation was planned to last for two years, with the option to continue in what’s known as an “open label” trial, in which every participant could choose to receive tominersen regularly after they completed their two year period in GENERATION-HD1.

In March of 2021, Roche stopped dosing people in the trial, because the data were starting to reveal potential safety issues. Tominersen not only had no overall benefit for people with HD, but the people in the 8 week group seemed to be doing worse, symptomatically, than those in other groups. It’s still not completely clear why this is the case, but it could have been due to the high dose of tominersen (120 mg) and frequent dosing leading to an immune reaction that was problematic over long periods of time. This would override the potential benefit of lowering huntingtin.

Wait, so why another trial?

Over the course of the past 18 months since the tough news came about GENERATION-HD1, Roche has been busy analyzing (and sharing) data from the trial, to try and understand what went wrong, and whether there might be a future for tominersen in HD. A glimmer of hope came in late 2021 when a new analysis showed that some participants in the trial might have benefitted from tominersen. Specifically, younger people who began the trial in earlier stages of HD did not seem to experience a worsening of symptoms over the course of their participation.

This finding comes with many caveats because the trial wasn’t designed to split people into smaller analysis groups, so it’s not clear how significant this finding is or if it will hold true for a larger group of people. However, Roche believed the data was hopeful enough to test tominersen again, this time in younger people with earlier signs and symptoms of HD. Taking all the data along with community and expert input into account, they have now announced what the new trial will look like. This happened in a presentation and community statement released during the recent conference of the European Huntington’s Disease Network (EHDN) in Bologna, Italy.

The new tominersen trial

This new tominersen trial will be called GENERATION-HD2, and if all goes as planned it will begin enrolling people with HD in early 2023. This is a Phase 2 study, looking at both safety and how huntingtin levels are lowered with different doses of tominersen. It will also involve three cohorts of participants, all receiving spinal injections every 4 months for 16 months. One group will get a lower dose (60 mg) of tominersen, one will get a higher dose (100 mg), and one will get placebo (injection with no drug). They aim to recruit about 360 people in 15 countries.

“ This new tominersen trial will be called GENERATION-HD2, and if all goes as planned it will begin enrolling people with HD in early 2023. ”

We’re waiting for more information on locations and exact guidelines for eligibility, but right now what we know is that the trial will recruit people aged 25 to 50, with very early subtle signs of HD or early movement symptoms. GENERATION-HD1 and the open label extension are now over, but people who previously participated in these trials of tominersen will not be eligible for GENERATION-HD2.

Just like with GENERATION-HD1, an independent data monitoring committee (iDMC) will review the data as the trial progresses. Roche scientists hope that lower, less frequent doses, and earlier treatment could help to overcome the safety issues and might reveal some of the potential benefits of huntingtin lowering with tominersen.

Updates from Wave

At nearly the same time that we got news from Roche that GENERATION-HD2 would be launching, another piece of news regarding huntingtin lowering emerged. This came from Wave Life Sciences, who are also using ASO drugs to try and improve HD symptoms.

Before we can talk about Wave’s news, we have to remind ourselves of some basic HD Biology. Every human has two copies of the HD gene - the one from mom and one from dad. In the vast majority of cases, HD patients have only one mutant (expanded) copy of the HD gene - the one they inherited from their parent with HD. Their other copy doesn’t have the genetic change required to drive the development of HD.

Wave’s approach to huntingtin lowering is a little different from that taken by Roche and Ionis. Instead of trying to use an ASO to silence both copies of the HD gene in treated patients, Wave is only targeting the expanded copy of the HD gene.

We’ve covered the ideas behind Wave’s approach before on HDbuzz, but basically the concept is that preserving the levels of the normal huntingtin protein could be important. Although researchers still don’t understand everything the HD gene does, we know it’s a very important one, and so keeping some healthy protein around might prove beneficial.

Roche and Wave have different targets for their huntingtin-lowering ASOs. While Roche is more broadly targeting both huntingtin copies, Wave is only targeting the expanded copy. The hope is that keeping more of the unaffected huntingtin protein around will be beneficial.

A selective approach to treat HD

What’s difficult about this selective approach is that, so far, we don’t have effective ASOs that target the actual HD mutation. So Wave has come up with a clever way to target only the expanded copy of the HD gene, by taking advantage of other tiny spelling changes in the HD gene.

While this technology theoretically lets you only reduce the mutant copy of HD, it has a limitation that a given person must have the right little spelling changes for Wave’s targeted drug to work. So not every HD patient could use any of the ASOs that Wave is currently testing in clinical trials.

An earlier version of their ASO failed in clinical trials; it wasn’t harmful, but it just didn’t lower huntingtin. Wave went back to the drawing board and made a new ASO with different chemistry which they hope will work better. Wave is now running a trial called SELECT-HD to test whether this new selective ASO drug can lower the mutant Huntingtin protein, and if that has benefit for HD patients. This is a relatively small trial - 18 participants have been enrolled to date and they expect around 36 total. Each participant is getting either placebo, or one of several doses of Wave’s selective ASO.

The goal of Wave’s study is to see if the drug is safe, and to try and figure out ahead of time what doses of the drug are effective at reducing levels of the huntingtin protein in the spinal fluid. This trial intentionally doesn’t include enough people to determine whether the drug has an impact on HD symptoms - as we saw with the GENERATION-HD1 trial, that takes many hundreds of participants. Exposing that many people to a drug at this early stage would be unethical, so Wave will dose a smaller group of volunteers with the drug to establish its safety.

Lowering of the HD protein

Last week, Wave provided us with an update from their trial. In a planned monitoring of the efficiency of the drug, Wave was able to see that treatment with 30 or 60 mg of drug led to a reduction of levels of the mutant Huntingtin protein. This is the first time that Wave’s HD ASOs have been shown to lower levels of the target protein.

“ This is, as far as we know, the first time anyone has ever selectively lowered only one copy of a protein inside of a human body. ”

The data are a little more complicated than we’re used to hearing about from Roche, because Wave has the goal of lowering the mutant HD gene, but preserving the regular one. Scientists at Wave have developed a test that they believe allows them to measure both of these things from the same sample. So, for the first time, we’re able to see what impact a treatment has on the levels of both normal and mutant huntingtin.

Wave shared data in their update which indicates that their drug was able to lower the levels of mutant huntingtin by 20-30%. This did not seem to be matched by a reduction in levels of regular Huntingtin, which stayed about the same. This is, as far as we know, the first time anyone has ever selectively lowered only one copy of a protein inside of a human body.

Increased neurofilament levels?

There was some news in the press release that gave us pause, however. While there weren’t any adverse events associated with treatment with Wave’s ASOs, some participants showed an increase in the levels of Neurofilament in their spinal fluid. We’ve discussed neurofilament before at Buzz - basically it’s a marker of brain cell damage.

In HD and other brain diseases, levels of neurofilament are increased, due to the harm caused to brain cells in these conditions. An attractive idea is to use neurofilament levels to try and see if an experimental drug lowers the levels of neurofilament as the damage to brain cells is halted or reduced.

The Wave study hasn’t run long enough to expect to see a big rescue of the neurofilament levels in HD patients. In the spinal fluid samples from some of the patients in the study, Wave saw an unexpected increase in the levels of neurofilament. No information has been provided by Wave as to why this might be happening but they plan to monitor this carefully.

Long-time readers might remember that in the early days of Roche’s development of tominersen, something similar happened. The people in the first human study of tominersen saw some increases in neurofilament as well. In the case of tominersen, those increases went away over time, for reasons that no one yet understands.

Wave shared data which indicates that their drug was able to lower the levels of mutant huntingtin by 20-30% Image credit: WAVE Life Sciences

It could be that the increase in neurofilament that Wave is seeing in some of their SELECT-HD study could get back to normal, as happened in the early studies with tominersen, but we just don’t know at this stage. We need more data from longer treatments in more patients to understand what these short-term increases in neurofilament might mean.

Key takeaways

The past few years have been a tough time for people in the HD community. The pandemic years have brought a pandemic of difficult news, most recently with the halting of the VIBRANT-HD trial being run by Novartis with yet another huntingtin lowering approach.

It’s a welcome change to have some more positive news on this front, and good to see advances being made by multiple companies, with distinct approaches to huntingtin-lowering. Until we have effective drugs for HD, we won’t know which approach will be most effective, so it’s critical that we continue testing different approaches to this really tricky problem.

That said, it’s important to remember that huntingtin-lowering remains an unproven approach to treat HD in people. Even if we can safely lower the levels of total huntingtin or just the mutant huntingtin protein in people, we don’t yet know if this will help slow or halt the progression of symptoms. But that’s why we need to run these clinical trials to test out these approaches and hopefully find something which works.

We remain optimistic that at least one of the approaches currently being tested in the clinic or the lab may prove beneficial for people with HD. It’s thanks to the brave and selfless volunteers who participate in this research that we may find a treatment. Stay tuned to HDBuzz for more news on these trials as they develop.

Switzerland’s Hoffmann La Roche AG no longer markets its cancer immunotherapy atezolizumab (Tecentriq) for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma in the USA: The reason for the pharmaceutical company's voluntary withdrawal from the largest western pharmaceutical market is the disappointing results of a post-marketing study that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had imposed on the manufacturer before the final marketing approval. Because of the medically high need for effective bladder cancer therapies, the FDA had initially granted Roche/Genentech accelerated approval on a thin data basis. The marketing authorisation remains valid for the indications lung cancer, breast carcinoma and liver carcinoma.

Atezolizumab binds to the surface protein PD-L1 (""programmed cell death 1 ligand 1""), with which cancer cells protect themselves from attack by the immune system, and was approved six years ago as a second-line therapy after cisplatin-based chemotherapy failed or could not be administered. Even then, the results were not very convincing; partial remission was achieved in only 14.8% of patients.

The follow-up study IMvigor130 with 1,214 participants worldwide, in which alezolizumab was administered together with gemcitabine and carboplatin/cisplatin and compared with chemotherapy, however, did not deliver results even in patients who expressed a lot of PD-L1: Their overall survival did not increase significantly.

https://www.roche.com/xproject/xstories/women-in-leadership/,Women in leadership: paving the way for equal health,"Although women comprise a majority of the overall health workforce, they make up a minority of leadership roles.

As leaders, women are more likely to make decisions that have a direct impact on the lives of women and children.1 Female representation in leadership positions can play a key role in prioritising women’s health issues, leading to more data being generated in women’s health that has to-date been missing and created a gap in care. Although more women are reaching decision-making positions, a large discrepancy remains across industries, including healthcare. That’s another key reason why we are so focused on enabling more women’s voices at the top, to ensure equal opportunities, diversity of thought and to pivot decisions that will close the gender data gap and improve health outcomes for the wider population. Data drives decisions Historically, decisions in healthcare have led to conditions primarily affecting women being understudied; in three quarters of cases, these diseases are underfunded compared to diseases that primarily affect men,2 meaning not enough data has been collected in women’s health. Further, when data is collected among men and women, it is often not subject to gender-based analysis, so how diseases impact each gender differently is generally not well-understood. “Data builds the foundation of all decisions that are made in healthcare. This means when there are gaps in data, there are gaps in care, which can have wide reaching health implications,” Avaleigh Milne, Head of Business Development for pRED, Pharma Partnering said. “The existing gaps in health data across gender, as well as race and ethnicity, provide an opportunity for the industry to increase focus on inclusive research, which starts with inclusive leadership.”

“The existing gaps in health data across gender, as well as race and ethnicity, provide an opportunity for the industry to increase focus on inclusive research, which starts with inclusive leadership.” Avaleigh Milne Head of Business Development for pRED, Pharma Partnering

Advancing change Various social and cultural barriers prevent women from attaining leadership roles, including gender discrimination, entrenched perceptions of women’s role in society and lack of work-life balance, among many.3 This means that improving the representation of women in leadership requires commitment to systemic change. “In a challenging and complex field such as healthcare, building a culture of different perspectives and varied expertise is key to come up with the best ideas and bring innovation forward to meet the needs of diverse patient populations,” Avaleigh shared. “At Roche, we place real emphasis on bringing together diversity in talent and in thought to enable our teams to thrive and have the greatest impact for all patients.” Enabling the representation of women at the leadership level is an important part of this. As such, Roche fosters an environment that supports women in leadership through systemic practices and policies, such as flexible working arrangements and childcare support. One leader at Roche, Barbara Lueckel, Head of Research Technologies, Pharma Partnering, experienced firsthand the impact these can have on her career. “When my daughters were born, having flexibility in my role was critical to balancing the responsibilities of being a working mother,” she explained. Barbara believes that another key element to addressing barriers lies in company culture and the network that supports you. “Having colleagues and leaders that see your potential and care for your success is so important. At Roche, I have been lucky to have people surrounding me who give me candid advice and strong support to ensure I pursue the career journey that fits my skills, ambitions and values. I now aim to do the same for other women, as I know how valuable this can be,” said Barbara.

More than 25 diversity networks at Roche make up the International Women's Networks, supporting professional development and advancement, through the sharing of best practices, participation in global initiatives and focus on allyship, mentorship, education and growth opportunities. Another resource is the Women’s Professional Group, which elevates, advocates, and facilitates the growth and development of women throughout the company. Roche also has initiatives in place to raise awareness of and mitigate unconscious biases in promotion patterns, performance evaluation, and selection processes. Continuing to empower and enable women to occupy decision-making positions will help kick off a domino effect to pave the way to closing the gender data gap and lead to a greater emphasis on women’s health overall.","['Avaleigh Milne', 'Head Of Business Development For Pred', 'Pharma Partnering', 'Barbara Lueckel', 'Head Of Research Technologies']",

https://www.mddionline.com/ivd/roche-scores-worlds-first-cdx-certificate-under-new-eu-regulation,Roche Scores World's First CDx Certificate Under New EU Regulation,"Last year, Roche Diagnostics became the first manufacturer to score certification for a class D product under the new in vitro diagnostic regulation (IVDR) in the European Union. Now, Roche has scored the world's first CDx (companion diagnostics) certificate under the IVDR.

TÜV SÜD Product Service issued the certificate for Roche's companion diagnostics assay used to identify cancer patients who are most likely to benefit from a specific therapeutic treatment.

Companion diagnostics are key diagnostic tools to further enhance the emerging field of personalized medicine, TÜV SÜD noted. companion diagnostics are clinically validated to identify patient populations, allowing more individualized treatment based on a specific patient’s likelihood of response.

The IVDR introduced a new concept of risk classification for IVDs as well as a reorganization of the conformity assessment process. In general, the mandatory notified body involvement for IVDs to achieve a CE mark has increased significantly, from about 15% of IVDs with certification to the present level of more than 80% of IVDs.

While the EU Commission's new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) has drawn considerable criticism from industry, complying with the EU IVDR has been less burdensome than the diagnostics industry once feared it would be. In March 2022, RQM+, a regulatory consulting firm, published a paper highlighting synergies between the EU Commission's IVDR requirements and the requirements of FDA in the United States.

Previously, manufacturers could put companion diagnostics on the market without notified body involvement. Companion diagnostics are now classified as Class C and need to undergo a newly established conformity assessment in which the notified body is required to consult the respective competent authority (CA) for medicinal products according to the 2001/83/EC directive or the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

The involvement of an additional stakeholder – in the form of the EMA or the respective CA – increases the time needed for the overall notified body conformity assessment process, and this must be taken into consideration by companion diagnostic manufacturers, TÜV SÜD noted. The IVDR now requires Class C CDx products to be CE marked with the involvement of a notified body such as TÜV SÜD Product Service by May 2026.

More devices, fewer notified bodies

Introduction of the new risk-based classification system also means that manufacturers now have to involve a notified body in the approval of most IVDs, according to TÜV SÜD. The notified body acknowledged that the IVDR also establishes significantly stricter requirements for notified bodies, which now need to consult reference laboratories and other competent authorities. This extends the time taken up by conformity assessment processes.

These stricter requirements have had a negative impact on the number of available notified bodies in the EU. To prepare for the regulation, however, TÜV SÜD said it increased and qualified its resources over the last four to five years at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 20%.",[],2023-01-04 18:37:07+00:00

An experimental Alzheimer’s drug designed to slow cognitive decline failed to meet the goals of two closely watched clinical trials, a discouraging development that underscores the challenges of developing treatments for the memory-robbing disease. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Genentech, a division of health-care giant Roche, said in a news release Monday that the treatment, called gantenerumab, slowed the pace of decline in patients with early-stage disease but not enough to be statistically significant.

The therapy was tested in identical late-stage trials, each with 1,000 participants. Half received placebos and half got the treatment. The studies lasted 27 months.

The drug, a monoclonal antibody, is designed to remove from the brain clumps of an abnormal version of a protein called amyloid beta, a hallmark of the disease. The company said Monday that the treatment removed less amyloid beta than expected. Some scientists have thought for years that amyloid-busting medicines could slow the fatal neurodegenerative disease, but there have been multiple failures, and just a few encouraging signs, involving amyloid-busting drugs.

“So many of our families have been directly affected by Alzheimer’s, so this news is very disappointing to deliver,” Levi Garraway, Roche’s chief medical officer and head of global product development, said in a statement. He said the company looks forward to sharing more information about the results “as we continue to search for new treatments for this complex disease.”

Genentech said that 25 percent of the patients who received gantenerumab experienced a side effect that can cause brain swelling and bleeding but that most did not have symptoms and few needed to stop taking the drug. The company said it planned to present more data from the trials at an Alzheimer’s conference this month.

The company assessed the drug by measuring trial participants’ performance on an 18-point measure of memory and cognition, called the Clinical Dementia Rating scale — Sum of Boxes.

The news on gantenerumab is a disappointment for patients, physicians and researchers desperate for effective treatments for a disease that affects 6.5 million Americans.

Hopes for anti-amyloid drugs rose in September when Japanese drugmaker Eisai and its U.S. partner, Biogen, announced trial results showing that their experimental amyloid-reducing drug slowed the pace of cognitive and functional decline by 27 percent.

That drug, called lecanemab, was the first therapy found to slow Alzheimer’s in a rigorous, well-executed trial. But like with gantenerumab, the information released on lecanemab was limited. More data is scheduled for release near the end of the month at the Alzheimer’s conference.

In a statement Monday, the Alzheimer’s Association said it was disappointed by the gantenerumab data but that the results will contribute to the understanding of Alzheimer’s. “Although the drug did not meet its primary endpoint, the trials further illustrate the relationship between removal of beta-amyloid and reduction of clinical decline,” the association said.

The statement said research on anti-amyloid drugs should continue.

“We know that current anti-amyloid approaches are not a cure, nor will they stop the disease on their own, but they are the first wave of effective treatments for Alzheimer’s, with more to come,” the statement said.

The Genentech trials were designed to be identical in the hopes that the results would replicate each other, officials said in interviews before the results were known. The drug is administered by a needle under the skin.

Another anti-amyloid treatment, by Eli Lilly, is in late-stage trials with results expected next year.

After the positive results for the Eisai-Biogen drug were announced in September, some Alzheimer’s researchers were hoping the field, long plagued by failure, might be turning a corner. But the disappointing Genentech data will bolster arguments by others who remain unconvinced that removing amyloid clumps from the brain is an effective way to go.

Last year, the Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to another anti-amyloid drug called Aduhelm, despite murky effectiveness data. Studies showed that the drug lowered amyloid, but they did not show that it slowed cognitive decline. The treatment never won broad Medicare coverage or acceptance from patients or physicians.

https://english.alarabiya.net/News/world/2022/11/14/Roche-Alzheimer-s-drug-fails-in-clinical-studies,Roche Alzheimer’s drug fails in clinical studies,"Roche Holding AG said a much-awaited drug for Alzheimer’s disease failed in a pair of large studies, another disappointment in a research field marred with failures.

The experimental medicine, called gantenerumab, didn’t slow clinical decline in people with early Alzheimer’s, Roche said Monday. Neither study met its main research objective.

Hopes rose for Roche’s drug after a similar treatment hit a milestone two months ago, becoming the first product to slow progression of Alzheimer’s in a definitive trial.

However, Roche had cautioned -- especially given the history of failures in the field -- that the success of Biogen Inc. and Eisai Co.’s lecanemab didn’t necessarily mean gantenerumab would also meet its targets.

Like Biogen and Eisai, Roche didn’t release the full study, making comparisons between the two trial results difficult.

The people who got the Roche medicine showed a rate of clinical decline that was 8 percent and 6 percent lower, in the respective trials, than those on placebo -- a result that wasn’t statistically significant. By comparison, lecanemab showed a 27 percent reduction.

Plaque Buildup

Both drugs are antibodies that targets the beta amyloid protein that accumulates in the brain years before symptoms of Alzheimer’s appear. There’s a difference in how they bind to beta amyloid, though, and gantenerumab removed less of the protein in the studies than researchers had expected, Roche said.

“Gantenerumab’s failure is likely due to lower-than-expected levels of beta-amyloid removal,” Peter Welford and Rosie Turner, analysts at Jefferies, wrote in a note.

They had estimated that the drug could generate $6 billion in peak annual sales. But like many investors, they didn’t expect the Roche studies to succeed.

The Swiss drugmaker ran two simultaneous large studies on gantenerumab in an effort to show clearly whether the medicine could help patients.

https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/sonny-vaccaro-chats-about-his-courtship-of-michael-jordan-for-nike-with-dan-roche/,'Air' inspiration Sonny Vaccaro discusses his courtship of Michael Jordan for Nike,"BOSTON -- Basketball and movie fans alike will enjoy ""Air,"" the new movie detailing Nike's courtship of Michael Jordan before he was Michael Jordan. The man behind that courtship, Sonny Vaccaro, is played by Cambridge's own Matt Damon.

The real Vaccaro was a consultant on the movie, but he wasn't the driving force to have the story hit the big screen.

""I had no idea the movie was being made,"" Vaccaro told WBZ-TV on Friday.

But Vaccaro was more than happy to chat with Damon, who gives another stellar performance in the flick.

""Obviously, Matt doesn't look like me,"" said Vaccaro, who is now 83. ""He had a balloon on to make him look heavier. In 1984, I was about 240 pounds. Much better now, I'm at high school playing weight now.""

Back in 1984, Vaccaro was working in Nike's lesser known college division. But when he was summoned to meet with the company's decision makers to discuss which players Nike should try to sign, Vaccaro had a gut feeling about one player: Michael Jordan.

Two years earlier, as a freshman, Jordan helped lead UNC to a national championship. But there were other stars that other Nike executives wanted to go after. And no one else wanted to put all of the company's eggs into one basket like Vaccaro.

""It wasn't easy. It was a miracle that those guys even listened,"" Vaccaro said. ""[Charles] Barkley was in that class. [John] Stockton was in that class. Hell, Hakeem Olajuwon [was in that class]. It was a great class ... but I think this kid is the kid.""

Vaccaro stuck with Jordan, who was the third pick in that 1984 draft, and pushed hard.

""Michael is different. The mindset inside of him that makes him competitive, it's a natural born thing,"" said Vaccaro.

After convincing Nike, it was time to convince Michael. That wasn't easy, either.

""He called Nike 'Nicky,'"" Vaccaro recalls of his first meeting with Jordan. ""He didn't know anything about it.""

In a desperation move, Vaccaro went through Michael's mother, Delores, who is played by Viola Davis in ""Air.""

""I made a blind call. She knew that Michael met with a guy from Nike,"" he said. ""She was kind. Nice.""

Vaccaro got Jordan to sign with Nike, beating out ADIDAS and Converse. Nike has gone on to make billions off the Air Jordan line.

""That changed my life. Nike's life for sure. And Michael started something that will live forever,"" said Vaccaro.

As part of his consultant duties, Vaccaro went out to L.A. to meet with Damon and director/star/fellow Boston native Ben Affleck and watch them make the movie. He says there are some embellishments -- but not harmful embellishments -- in the movie.

Vaccaro is happy that this story is being told, and to have a place in sneaker history.

""We'll both be dead, but they'll know 'Air.' And when they talk about Air Jordan, they'll think of Sonny Vaccaro also,"" he said. ""Somewhere, it will be written this guy was with Michael at the beginning.""","['Dan Roche', 'Dan Roche Is An Award-Winning Sports Anchor', 'Reporter For Wbz-Tv News', 'Wsbk-Tv .']",

The new system has the potential to find and quantify ultra-rare, hard to detect mutations, leading to early diagnosis and treatment strategies.

The Digital LightCycler System is designed for laboratories performing highly sensitive and precise DNA and RNA analysis in areas such as oncology and infectious diseases.





Basel, 23 August 2022 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced the launch of the Digital LightCyclerⓇ System, Roche’s first digital polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) system. This next-generation system detects disease and is designed to accurately quantify trace amounts of specific DNA and RNA targets not typically detectable by conventional PCR methods.

The Digital LightCycler System will allow clinical researchers to divide DNA and RNA from an already extracted clinical sample into as many as 100,000 microscopic individual reactions. The system can then perform PCR and produce highly sophisticated data analysis on the results.

""Understanding the hidden characteristics of serious diseases is fundamental for ensuring that the most effective treatment is selected for each patient,"" said Thomas Schinecker, CEO of Roche Diagnostics. “The Digital LightCycler System will support clinical researchers and laboratories in identifying rare and emerging disease mutations. This can be instrumental in early diagnosis and therapy decisions.""

For areas like oncology and infectious disease, the system provides new opportunities for researchers beyond what traditional PCR technology can achieve. This includes ultra rare targets, accurately quantifying how much of the target DNA or RNA there is at a molecular level, and other high precision analysis.

Roche has made significant contributions to establish and advance PCR technology over several decades. In 1991, Roche saw the potential in PCR and invested in refining the science for use in molecular diagnostics to detect pathogens and genetic code changes that lead to diseases.

The unique capabilities of the Digital LightCycler System complement the Roche suite of widely available PCR solutions. The launch of this new system adds to this PCR ecosystem, and builds on the company’s founding legacy in PCR. Both solutions will be offered by Roche, providing a suite of molecular solutions to the healthcare community.

The system will be available in 15 countries worldwide in 2022 with plans to launch into more countries in the near future. It will be CE-marked and has an FDA 510(k) exempt status.

About the Digital LightCycler System

The Digital LightCycler System is the first digital PCR (dPCR) system from Roche and is intended for in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) testing. It performs absolute quantification of DNA and RNA targets using PCR technology. The Digital LightCycler System provides flexibility for laboratories through three unique reaction plates allowing customisation of the sample volumes used, the number of times a sample is partitioned (divided), and how many different tests can be run on a single sample (known as multiplexing). The system also features an easy workflow, moving from sample to results efficiently.

The Elecsys HCV Duo immunoassay enables significantly earlier diagnosis of active HCV infection, making it possible to get patients appropriate care sooner to stop both the disease progression and transmission.

Basel, 18 July 2022 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced the launch of the Elecsys® HCV Duo immunoassay in countries that accept the CE Mark. Elecsys HCV Duo is the first available immunoassay that allows the simultaneous and independent determination of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) antigen and antibody status from a single human plasma or serum sample. This means that the test can be used to detect the early stage of infection, as well as when the patient is recovering from the virus, or showing signs of a chronic infection that may lead to other diseases, such as liver cancer.

By utilising the dual detection of HCV core antigen and antibodies to HCV, the Elecsys HCV Duo assay enables significantly earlier diagnosis of active hepatitis C virus infection compared to using antibody-only assays, as core antigen appears early in the course of infection and is a marker of ongoing viral replication. This can lead to earlier intervention for patients, reduction in the number of clinic visits needed to take additional test samples and can alleviate some of the testing burden on healthcare systems.

“With improved hepatitis screening, healthcare systems have the opportunity to eliminate the disease through improved prevention, testing and treatment services,'' said Thomas Schinecker, CEO of Roche Diagnostics. “The addition of the Elecsys HCV Duo assay to our HCV testing portfolio can help in the fight to eliminate the hepatitis C virus. The launch of this innovative dual antigen and antibody diagnostic test underlines our commitment to support clinicians and their patients in reducing the impact of infectious diseases, where it’s needed most.”

In 2019, 58 million people were living with chronic HCV infection, but only 21% were aware of it.1 290,000 people died of hepatitis C-related causes, like cirrhosis and liver cancer, more than those due to HIV or malaria. While there is no vaccine available for HCV, there is effective treatment with antivirals that can lead to a cure in 98% of patients.1 However, to find affected populations there is a greater emphasis on increased access and utilisation of testing to reduce the impact of the virus, as well as to provide better disease management for patients testing positive for HCV.3

Through early detection and intervention it is possible to get patients appropriate care sooner, stop the disease progression, as well as transmission and, potentially, reduce unnecessary healthcare costs. Addressing these factors is crucial in efforts to eradicate the disease. Currently, there are major gaps in access to hepatitis C testing and treatment in all populations, especially among economically disadvantaged populations, as well as those living in rural regions.

About the Elecsys HCV Duo immunoassay

Elecsys® HCV Duo is an immunoassay for the in vitro qualitative determination of hepatitis C virus (HCV) core antigen (HCV Ag) and antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) in human serum and plasma. The test, in conjunction with other laboratory results and clinical information, may be used to aid in the diagnosis of and the screening for HCV infection. The test can also be used as a screening test to prevent transmission of HCV to recipients of blood, blood components, cells, tissue, and organs. The subresults (HCV Ag and anti‑HCV) are intended as an aid in the selection of the confirmatory testing algorithm for reactive samples.

The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on the cobas e 801 and cobas e 402 immunoassay analyzers.

About hepatitis C

Hepatitis C is an inflammatory liver disease caused by infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). According to the World Health Organization, 1.5 million people were newly infected with HCV, in 2019.2 Approximately 58 million people are chronic carriers of the hepatitis C virus, and most do not know they are infected.2 The disease can ultimately result in cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma, which together are responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. While the momentum to address viral hepatitis is growing, progress in service delivery is still insufficient. Only 21% of people living with chronic hepatitis C infection know their status. 9.4 million people chronically infected with HCV were receiving treatment at the end of 2019, a 10-fold increase from 1 million people receiving treatment at the end of 2015, yet treatment coverage is only 13% of the people in need.2 Causes of hapatitis spreading include percutaneous exposure to blood (e.g. by sharing needles, poorly sterilised medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, unsanitary tattooing/piercing, blood/blood product transfusion, hemodialysis), organ and tissue transplants and grafts, sexual contact or from being passed from an infected mother to their fetus.4 These populations are the focus for existing testing protocols.

https://www.genomeweb.com/business-news/jp-morgan-healthcare-conference-day-2-thermo-fisher-agilent-roche-seer-more,"JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, Day 2: Thermo Fisher, Agilent, Roche, Seer, More","SAN FRANCISCO – The 41st Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference continued on Tuesday with more firms in the diagnostics and genomics tools spaces providing updates on their businesses.

Below are brief reports on individual presentations from the conference on Tuesday. A recap of Day 1's news is available here.

Thermo Fisher Scientific

Thermo Fisher Scientific CEO Marc Casper highlighted the firm's 2022 accomplishments, including its recent £2.25 billion acquisition of UK-based specialty diagnostics firm The Binding Site at a Tuesday morning session. Announced in October, Thermo Fisher closed the deal Jan. 3.

Having kept an eye on The Binding Site for nearly a decade, buying it was ""not a new idea,"" Casper said during the Q&A portion of his talk. Rather, several financial conditions aligned to allow Thermo Fisher to swoop in. Funding costs for private equity companies went up, warding off potential competition, while the pound sterling's relative weakness compared to the dollar allowed the company to ""leverage that moment of time on exchange rates,"" he said.

Overall, 2022 was ""one of our best years ever,"" he said, noting several product launches including the Sanger sequencing-based Applied Biosystems SeqStudio Flex genetic analyzer and the Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid mass spectrometer.

Casper also highlighted the firm's December announcement of loftier ambitions for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The firm now plans to decrease its Scope 1 and 2 — the emissions it has the most control over — by 50 percent by 2030, up from 30 percent.

Looking ahead, Casper said he is ""even more excited about 2023."" Regarding price increases in 2022 of approximately 3 percent that had been passed on to customers, Casper suggested that prices ""will not revert back to normal but won't be as elevated as in 2022.""

The firm had recently guided to foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $1 billion. However, the current foreign exchange environment is ""more positive than it was"" and the impact will likely be less, Casper said.

Lastly, he noted that Thermo Fisher has ""substantial firepower… in terms of the ability to deploy capital,"" with approximately $50 billion available over the next three years.

Agilent Technologies

Agilent Technologies CEO Mike McMullen highlighted the firm's recent $725 million commitment to expand its therapeutic nucleic acid manufacturing capabilities in his presentation.

On Monday, the firm announced it would invest to double manufacturing capacity at its Frederick, Colorado, facility in response to growing demand in a market it values at $1 billion now and up to $2.4 billion by 2027. The funding will create two additional manufacturing lines, or trains, which will produce siRNA, antisense oligos, and CRISPR guide RNAs by 2026.

Agilent already has one train running and the second train will become operational midyear, adding at least $150 million in revenue capacity and ramping to full production by the end of the firm's fiscal year in September. The company’s existing business crossed the $300 million revenue threshold in fiscal year 2022. ""We're on the road to a $1 billion revenue business,"" McMullen said.

During the Q&A portion of the session, Agilent CFO Robert McMahon said he was ""confident"" there will be enough demand for these molecules, based on conversations with existing customers about their future clinical trials. ""If you look at the areas for oligo therapeutics being targeted, they're broader and broader patient populations,"" he said.

McMullen also touched on the firm's recent collaboration with Akoya Biosciences to commercialize a spatial tissue analysis platform. ""It's a great way to participate in the space,"" he said, noting that the deal was nonexclusive.

He noted that the firm saw 18 percent growth in China in fiscal year 2022, despite COVID-19 lockdowns in the country that have hampered revenues from that region for many other life sciences tools companies. Cell analysis provided approximately $400 million in revenues in FY2022, he said.

In November, Agilent provided fiscal 2023 revenue guidance of $6.90 billion to $7.00 billion, or growth in the range of 5 percent to 6.5 percent, and EPS guidance in the range of $5.61 to $5.69. ""We have good visibility for the next three to six months,"" McMullen said. ""We really don't know what the back half of the year is going to look like.""

Regarding M&A potential, McMullen reiterated that cell analysis, genomics, and diagnostics ""still remain the priority areas for the company.""

Roche

Roche CFO Alan Hippe said in his presentation that COVID-19 sales are fading as the base business grows and the company expects to lose roughly CHF 5 billion ($5.42 billion) in COVID-19 sales in 2023, which represents about 8 percent of total sales and will be hard to compensate for. He did not provide preliminary Q4 or full-year 2022 results but confirmed Roche's 2022 outlook of stable to low-single-digit group sales growth and said he doesn't expect any surprises in the results.

The COVID-19 pandemic provided a much higher instrument installed base — as of Q3 2022, the firm had about 2,000 high-throughput Cobas 6800/8800 instruments placed. The placements allowed Roche to gain market share in the US and China, Hippe said.

In the Cobas serum work area, menu expansion is driving future growth with a constant flow of tests, he said. There are more than 100,000 installed Cobas SWA instruments with more than 240 assays available.

The company is also developing an integrated mass spectrometry instrument that will open a lot of opportunities, and the firm has 30 to 40 mass spec tests in the works, Hippe said. Roche sees the instrument as a significant market opportunity with a CHF 2.9 billion accessible market. Hippe noted that many mass spectrometry instruments are very manual and require a customized approach, but that Roche would like to offer a high-throughput system that doesn't require a lot of manual effort and produces standardized results.

There is also a benchtop analyzer in development designed for the needs of emerging markets that combines immunochemistry and clinical chemistry, as well as a next-generation sequencing solution that would be integrated with Roche's existing sequencing infrastructure and open the door for high-throughput sequencing, Hippe said.

Roche Diagnostics has had difficulties with its diagnostics business in China due to COVID-19-related lockdowns, but Hippe said it is getting closer to normalization. However, the chance of future lockdowns is a risk and would have an effect on the business.

Hippe also mentioned that Roche has made significant investments in artificial intelligence and digital health, spending roughly CHF 3 billion per year on digital opportunities in every area of the company.

In addition, Hippe said that the firm has a lot of financial flexibility to fund both its own business and M&A and is aiming for bolt-on acquisitions on both the pharmaceutical and diagnostics sides of the business.

Seer

Proteogenomics firm Seer more than doubled its revenues and platform installed base year over year in 2022 — its first year of broad commercial release — CEO Omid Farokhzad said in a Tuesday afternoon presentation.

While most of his talk focused on the relative advantages of the firm's nanotechnology-based protein detection platform, he noted that the firm collected $11 million in revenues in the first nine months of the year and has reached 165 full-time employees.

He highlighted the firm's new Proteograph Analysis Suite 2.0 workflow and said the firm has placed its next product in the hands of early-access customers, though he did not provide additional information.

The Proteogenomics Consortium, announced at last year's virtual JP Morgan Healthcare meeting in partnership with Discovery Life Sciences and Sciex, has a facility ""up and running"" in Boston, Farokhzad said, and is ready to receive customer samples.

""What we've tried to do is take down the accessibility barrier,"" Seer CFO David Horn said during the Q&A portion of the session. The consortium allows access to the technology for researchers who may not yet be interested in buying the platform. ""We don't want [Seer] to be a service business,"" he added.

In 2023, the firm will seek to obtain ISO 13485 certification to enable future clinical validation of its proteograph technology.

Seer's pipeline is split ""50-50"" between commercial and academic entities; however, the current customer base is 60-40 in favor of commercial entities. Commercial customers are ""more positioned to pursue large-scale studies quicker,"" Horn noted.

For example, PrognomiQ, a multiomic liquid biopsy firm spun off of Seer prior to its 2020 IPO, is planning a 15,000-subject study.

In Tuesday trading on the Nasdaq, shares of Seer were up nearly 13 percent at $5.67.

Abbott

Despite the tough macroenvironment conditions, such as supply chain issues and labor shortages, that are acting as headwinds on the business, Abbott CEO Robert Ford in his presentation said that the firm has seen positive momentum since Q3 2022 as some of those headwinds have slightly abated. Abbott took advantage of its leadership position in COVID-19 testing to make investments in new technologies for non-COVID-19 diagnostics. Piggybacking off some of the R&D work already done for its COVID-19 tests means that the company doesn't have to put the same amount of investment into R&D this year to deliver top-line growth and that there is a lot of strategic flexibility within the business due to its strong balance sheet.

Although demand for COVID-19 testing will come down, Abbott still sees a continued need for testing as the virus becomes endemic, Ford said. The challenge in an endemic environment, Ford noted, is that the firm knows that while COVID-19 testing will decline, there's a lack of clarity in how quickly and at what rate those levels will decrease. The expected decline in 2022 didn't materialize, raising questions about how the transition from pandemic to endemic COVID-19 testing will go. Ford said Abbott will be a leader in the segment regardless due to its portfolio and the position, scale, and economic value it brings to the market.

Regardless, COVID-19 testing will still be important, either because of variants that will escape immunity or increases in respiratory testing overall during Q1 and Q4, correlating with the respiratory season in the Northern Hemisphere. ""When those [tests increase], it actually brings along all testing,"" as users want to know what disease they have, whether its COVID-19, influenza, or respiratory syncytial virus, he said.

The pandemic provided the public more access to rapid testing, opening up a whole new testing channel for Abbott, which it has taken advantage of to bring more assays into the market, Ford said.

He forecast high-single-digit percentage growth moving into 2023, similar to pre-pandemic growth rates, while noting that there have been challenges with input costs, inflation, and some supply chain disruption. Disruptions have been mitigated because of the company's diversity in businesses and geographies and its lack of reliance on a single product or platform, leaving it well positioned to weather any storms or recessionary periods.

As for the pipeline, Ford said that there is a mix of iterative projects and more transformational ones. For the diagnostics space, the No.1 R&D investment that Abbott can make is to increase the menu that will run on the instruments that it placed during the pandemic. Ford highlighted its blood-based traumatic brain injury assay to determine whether someone has experienced a TBI within 15 minutes. The test received 510(k) clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration in 2021 for use by physicians, but Abbott is working to move it to other settings outside of the laboratory.

Ford also addressed potential M&A opportunity, noting that its strong balance sheet ""leaves plenty of firepower"" for deals and that the company has strategic flexibility. The two key factors for M&A are whether there's a strategic fit, since Abbott doesn't want to dilute its growth rate or top line, and whether it fits financially. Strategically, Ford said that there is more of a focus on the firm's medical devices and diagnostics business for M&A and that Abbott sees a lot of opportunity and potential targets. On the financial side, he noted that there are many targets that may not have made sense financially in 2021 or 2022, but have now started to make sense.

He emphasized, however, that Abbott doesn't feel it needs M&A to reach its long-term growth goals, allowing it to be more opportunistic with any deals it makes.

Becton Dickinson

Becton Dickinson CEO Tom Polen emphasized ""BD 2025,"" the firm's three-year-old strategy to deploy organic R&D and tuck-in M&A in order to drive a shift to higher-growth end markets.

""We are executing very well, and have set the foundation for durable, profitable growth,"" Polen told the JPM audience.

Polen boasted that the Franklin Lakes, New Jersey-based firm launched 25 new products in fiscal year 2022 and projected it would launch more than 100 by 2025. A quarter of these new products have the potential to generate more than $50 million per year five years after launch, he said. Overall, the firm's R&D initiatives are on track to double new product revenue by 2025.

The new products that Polen highlighted in BD's life sciences division included the BD Max Plus, new BD Cor and BD Max Respiratory panels, and the BD Veritor combination COVID and influenza point-of-care test. The firm has launched two assays for the BD Cor system so far, with three more in the pipeline through 2024. BD is developing an over-the-counter at-home flu/COVID combination test, Polen said, while the company also teased a POC molecular system, trademarked BD Elience.

Within microbiology, key products in development include the Synapsys ID/AST system, the BD Kiestra 3rd Generation Lab Automation System, and a next-generation version of the BACTEC system. For single cell analysis, BD anticipates launching the FACSDiscover S8 Cell Sorter in the second half of the year, followed by the FACSDuet Premium and additional BD Horizon RealBlue and RealYellow dyes.

For FY 2022, ""with base revenue growth of 9 percent, we exceeded our revenue and earnings guidance, and achieved our margin expansion goals,"" Polen said, adding that this was despite the continued macroenvironment challenges. He provided FY23 base revenue growth guidance of 5.25 percent to 6.25 percent and adjusted EPS of $11.85 to $12.10 implying approximately 9 percent to 11 percent currency neutral growth.

""The future has never been brighter for BD,"" Polen said.

Danaher

During his presentation, Danaher CEO Rainer Blair provided additional color on his firm's preliminary Q4 earnings results announced after the close of the market on Monday. The company's estimated Q4 revenues are anticipated to increase in the low-single-digit percent range year over year, with Q4 core revenue growth in the high-single-digit percent range. The firm previously released guidance predicting flat to low-single-digit percent declines in core revenue growth, but better than expected respiratory testing revenues driven by growth in Danaher subsidiary Cepheid. The firm saw more than $1 billion in respiratory testing revenue during Q4, Blair said.

Base business core revenue growth is expected to be in line with the company's previous guidance in the high-single-digit percent range.

Blair also provided additional details on the planned spinout of Danaher's environmental and applied solutions business — containing its water quality and product identification segments — that was announced in September. The separation is on track to be completed by Q4 of this year and will allow both companies to reach their full potential, Blair said. Long-term performance for the new business, referred to as EAS, is expected to reach mid-single-digit core revenue growth with about 55 percent recurring revenue. The new company will also be able to meaningfully deploy cash for M&A, Blair said.

Danaher is also changing the makeup of its other product segments, extracting the biotechnology business, including Cytiva and Pall, from the life sciences segment. Biotechnology revenues are estimated to be about $8.8 billion for 2022, with Cytiva contributing about $6.0 billion. Life sciences revenues are anticipated to be around $7.0 billion and diagnostics revenues around $10.8 billion. While the diagnostics business outperformed expectations, Blair said that Beckman Coulter saw some headwinds from COVID-19 outbreaks in China that impacted patient volumes in the fourth quarter. The bioprocessing and life science instruments businesses grew as expected in the high-single-digit percent range.

The long-term growth rates for all three business segments after the EAS separation are expected to be in the high-single-digit percent range, Blair added. The company is rerating its growth and margin profile higher after the separation, forecasting low double-digit growth for the molecular diagnostic business, strong double-digit growth in the genomic franchises, and core revenue growth in the high-single digits.

Regarding China, Blair said despite the widespread COVID-19 outbreaks, the life sciences instruments business continues to be very strong even into the fourth quarter of 2022. Danaher expects the markets to release pent-up demand in the second half of 2023, and the company remains bullish on the nation as a long-term growth market. The firm is ""just scratching the surface"" on meeting the needs of the Chinese population from a healthcare perspective, he added.

Sophia Genetics

As it strives for profitability, Sophia Genetics touted its recent partnership agreements, including an announcement earlier on Tuesday that the Swiss-American company has entered into a collaboration with New York's Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to combine predictive algorithms to offer new testing and analytical capabilities to cancer researchers and clinicians worldwide.

Cofounder and CEO Jurgi Camblong also referenced deals with Microsoft, Agilent Technologies, AstraZeneca, and Boundless Bio as engines for growing its customer base to what now stands as more than 750 hospitals in Europe and the US. That base then allows the company to pursue a strategy of ""land and expand,"" in which customers start with an application or two from Sophia and then purchase more services as the first ones prove useful, according to Camblong.

The strategy led to ""core growth acceleration"" in the 2022 fourth quarter, according to CFO Ross Muken. He expects that acceleration to continue in 2023.

https://www.roche.com/stories/redefining-lung-cancer-together/,Redefining lung cancer together,"Every 14 seconds, someone is diagnosed with lung cancer.¹

Today, the definition of lung cancer is very different to what it was 20 years ago. What was once treated as a single condition, is now recognised as a diverse disease made up of numerous subtypes that all work differently.2-5 Our growing understanding of the science means that people can now undergo biomarker testing and receive treatments personalised to specific genetic features or immune pathways. Advances have changed the meaning of a lung cancer diagnosis; long-term survival is now a reality for some, rather than just a possibility.5,6 While we are making significant strides against lung cancer, progress has been slower compared to other cancer types. Unfortunately, many people still face poor prognosis and do not receive the best possible care.

Lung cancer is…

The leading cause of cancer deaths, more than breast, prostate and colon cancers combined¹ One of the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide¹ An aggressive disease and one of the most the most difficult to treat cancers¹⁻³

The earlier that lung cancer is diagnosed, the more likely it is that treatments can be effective, meaning patients may live longer.3,7 Unfortunately, there are numerous factors that can delay the diagnosis and treatment of people with lung cancer.8

Personalised care, targeted therapies and immunotherapy are the most important things we’ve done in the past 20 years in oncology. These advances are a major leap from where we were when I started this journey. But we still have a long way to go. Charlie Fuchs MD, MPH, Global Head of Oncology & Haematology Drug Development at Genentech and Roche

Key factors preventing early diagnosis

Symptoms

Screening

Stigma

Geography Lack of symptoms The absence of symptoms in the earlier stages make it difficult to detect. When symptoms do appear, they are often unspecific and can be mistaken for other diseases.8 Screening Screening can detect lung cancer at a much earlier stage and has been shown to reduce mortality by nearly a quarter among high-risk people. Yet very few countries have screening programmes for lung cancer.8-10 Stigma Diagnosis can be delayed due to the stigma and fear associated with lung cancer, often regarding smoking history, which may prevent people from seeking medical help, even if they are experiencing symptoms.8 Geography Disparities in healthcare across different countries and regions mean that some people have limited or no access to innovative services that support earlier intervention in lung cancer, such as screening, testing and treatment.8

One of the most important things we can do is find the best treatment for each person with lung cancer. The discovery of specific mutations and immune pathways has transformed the way some patients are treated.3,5 However, there are still many people in need of new options. We must continue to expand our understanding of how lung cancer operates to discover potential new drug targets.

Given what we know now about the complexity of disease, comprehensive biomarker testing at diagnosis is critical to rapidly and accurately identify each patient’s subtype and match them with the most optimal treatment, as quickly as possible.

By pioneering new ways to test for lung cancer, we can provide more accurate and timely results to help find the right treatment for the right patient, as well as monitor treatment performance and detect resistance.

Our teams are working tirelessly to redefine the future of clinical care and ensure each person diagnosed receives the care that they need. To truly make a difference, we must collaborate across the community to understand, recognise and address the most important challenges for patients. Continuing to drive progress in early diagnosis, testing and innovative treatment approaches, can help redefine this disease. There is still a long way to go, but Mark Brooke, CEO of Lung Foundation Australia, is optimistic for the future. “I think in the past three to five years, there is a sense of optimism creeping into lung cancer.”

While the five-year survival rates remain woefully low, what we are seeing with the age of precision medicine is more treatment options being available to patients and certainly with the increased number of biomarkers and targeted therapies available, more opportunities to beat that terrible survival statistic. Mark Brooke CEO of Lung Foundation Australia

At Roche, we are working closely with our partners – from patients and healthcare professionals to health systems and industry – towards our goal of improving the patient experience for every person, at every stage of their journey.

Every day we get closer to the promise of “mission cure”. We’ve got to be committed to taking bold steps – like moving medicines quickly into curative settings, which can be a risk. But that’s what we owe to patients.

https://www.irmagazine.com/sell-side/roches-new-head-ir-discusses-his-latest-role,Roche’s new head of IR discusses his latest role,"Bruno Eschli on identifying priorities, building his IR team and positioning IR in a large innovation-driven corporation

You’ve been part of the Roche IR team for several years and before that worked on the sell side. What elements of your past experience do you think made you best suited for the head of IR position?

I think it’s a mix of things. Actually, I would go back one further step in my career as the basis was laid with my training as a biochemist, doing basic research for six years, before joining a small boutique investment firm that focused on life sciences and healthcare investments. Both the narrow view as an expert scientist on a topic and the high-level view as an industry expert, which also included some work on corporate finance projects, were essential for successfully moving into the IRO role.

Bruno Eschli, Roche

Working as a scientist teaches you a lot about how scientific progress is achieved only slowly over time through hard work in an extremely fast-moving and competitive environment. Working as a sell-side financial analyst teaches you something about how to manage risk and reward in innovation from a portfolio and company perspective. What is also very important is that you get to know first-hand what life feels like for analysts, fund managers and investors, and you gain a deep understanding of the rules of the game.

What have been your biggest IR challenges and achievements since taking on the lead IR role at Roche? What excites you most about the role and IR more generally?

Because I was involved in all major aspects of IR at Roche before, I think we were able to manage a smooth hand-over in January. To me it was critical to keep the pace and quality of our communication and to ensure that engagement levels with the investor community remained high.

Besides our regular IR events at medical conferences and our Pharma Day – which we could finally host again in London – we also held our first ESG event on the topic of ‘Access to healthcare’ recently. Overall, I am very pleased with how the transition went. The top ratings we achieved a few weeks ago for our senior management and the entire IR program are a testimony to our efforts.

On the challenges: after the share price hit an all-time high, we faced some volatility due to first clinical data from late-stage trials for giredestrant and tiragolumab, which despite confirming their efficacy did not allow for an early launch. And with [potential Alzheimer’s treatment] gantenerumab there is another major readout just around the corner – overall I would say business as usual for an innovative pharma company, although it does not happen too often that the share price of a company the size of Roche gets moved that much.

Another challenge was an internal one: at the same time as the hand-over from Karl [Mahler], we had to fill several positions in the IR team. Keeping the pace, finding suitable candidates and getting them started was demanding but, overall, a good problem to have as our new team members bring additional, rich backgrounds and nicely complement the team’s capabilities.

I consider IR to be uniquely positioned within a large corporation like Roche with 100,000 employees. As IR people, we have two major tasks: one is inward-facing and includes building and maintaining a broad network so we get all necessary information in a timely manner. The other is external-facing in fulfilling our duties to keep investors updated on the company’s business prospects at any given time.

What really excites me is that because we are an innovation-driven company operating in highly competitive markets, you remain very close to scientific progress with many opportunities to meet key opinion leaders first hand so it really never gets boring and there is always something new to learn. As we are closely following analysts and competitors on a daily basis, there is also an occasional opportunity to bring an external perspective to the table.

What are your IR plans for the near term?

For the remainder of this year, we still expect a few late-stage read-outs, including gantenerumab – which is probably getting the most attention right now – and Vabysmo, which could lead to a label extension beyond the already approved indications in age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. In addition, we have scheduled one more IR event at a medical conference (ASH on December 14), where we will highlight our maturing portfolio in malignant and non-malignant hematology.",['Garnet Roach'],

https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/trail-tips-training/coach-roches-9-favorite-workouts-for-trail-runners/,Coach Roche’s 9 Favorite Workouts For Trail Runners,"When I first started learning about running training theory, I played football, but watched running and cycling races for fun whenever I could. For some reason that I can’t remember, it took going to college to realize that I may have chosen to play the wrong sport. After a few weeks of royally sucking at college football, I I hung up my cleats and ordered some running shoes. And I wanted to learn EVERYTHING.

I grew up with a dad who biked and taught me to cheer for Lance Armstrong at the Tour de France, so I always knew that I wanted endurance sports to be in my future. Quitting football meant that I could start the process four years sooner, with 25% less brain damage! Maybe the concussions from high school explained why I was so sure that Lance was 100% clean.

I read everything I could get my hands on. Books, studies, articles, Slowtwitch, LetsRun forums, blogs–I read like I was running out of time, already feeling past my prime at 18 years old. And my favorite type of writing was always about workouts. I was still struggling to run more than a few miles at a time, and these stories of badass sessions got me so damn hyped for the future. “One day,” I thought. “One day.”

After a few years of building up my base and adapting past every injury under the sun, that day came for me. A few years after that, I started coaching. First it was whoever accepted the offer for free coaching on a Facebook post. In retrospect, advertising free coaching on Facebook was a bit like advertising free soup in a public restroom. Thank god for my naivety. Eventually, I was coaching pros, learning from them and my co-coach Megan. We developed a massive almanac of workouts together, and an even bigger dataset showing how sessions correlate with subsequent trajectories.

This article is an attempt to distill what Megan and I have learned into a pre-Christmas gift to all of the aspiring athletes and coaches out there. Hopefully it plants some seeds for a kid or two out there who reads way too much so that they can take our lessons and exceed anything we have ever done. If that describes you, I have one request: anywhere from one to twenty years from now, you promise to write a similar article so that we can learn from you.

How to Do Trail Running Workouts: Background

As context, I think this statement is important (though don’t tell anyone I said it): I’m not sure that exact workout structure is the most important thing for athletic growth. It matters some, particularly for athletes wringing the last 0.1% out of their physiology, and especially in track and road racing. But the more data we gather from pro athlete training, the more we see that even for people pushing that last sliver of a percent, it’s less about the perfect workout design and more about balancing two general principles.

RELATED: The 4 Hardest Mid-Week Workouts I Give Athletes To Prepare For Races

Principle One: The amount of time within each aerobic intensity zone and how that relates to intensity distribution and stress generally.

Is the workout in Zone 3, or a moderate tempo? Zone 4, or a classic threshold or critical velocity effort? Zone 5, or a VO2 max+ push? Or is it some combination of those? Zones 3/4 will support a Pyramidal training structure, which may be better for long-term growth, but Zone 5 is important in small pulses to develop aerobic capacity and mechanical output. Most importantly, how does the aerobic intensity fit into the broader narrative of a training cycle? Highly stressful sessions may lead to optimal adaptations, or to an athlete snapping in two like a Twix bar. And 50 workouts that fall into the optimal category might not justify risking 1 workout that falls into the Twix category.

RELATED: 5 Workouts To Get You Faster . . . In 20 Minutes Or Less

Principle Two: Mechanical demand of the session.

Is it on flats, with a stronger neuromuscular and biomechanical emphasis, but also higher injury risk? Is it on hills, calling on muscular power, but with less neuromuscular speed adaptations? Or is it a combination of those? Hill workouts are much safer for most athletes, and that power will usually translate to flat speed. But there are tradeoffs, with many athletes overdoing intensity prescriptions on hills in a way that may reduce aerobic efficiency over time.

Balancing the Tradeoffs

Science and art come into conflict in coaching in that competition between aerobic development, mechanical output, and how those principles impact overall stress. The best workouts for aerobic development usually involve as much time as possible in Zones 3 and Zones 4. You can look to cycling for examples–sessions like 6-9 x 10 minutes or 2-3 x 20 minutes are common on the bike. When Nils Van Der Poel was training to set his speed skating world records (article here), he was looking for workouts that maximally stressed his aerobic system (which he couldn’t do on skates, where everything he did was race-pace or faster). So he’d do workouts like 4 x 30 minutes at bike threshold EVERY DAY FOR 5 DAYS! Shit gets wild at the margins of human performance.

I think that applying similar cycling-aerobic principles to running risks losing sight of the significantly greater mechanical demand, neuromuscular stress, and injury risk. Unless an athlete is very speed-talented, emphasizing bulky aerobic workouts over speed development usually results in them peaking young and slowing down progressively with time. And as coaches, we evaluate ourselves on 5+ year timescales. I want to coach like a Vanguard index fund, not a pump-and-dump Bitcoin scheme.

The best workouts for mechanical demands are usually harder/faster, or on hills, often pushing athletes into Zone 5 where output is highest. Here, take a look at swimming. Their workouts are often shorter and faster intervals since the biomechanical demand of swimming is so high. Personally, my swimming form looks like someone electrocuted a turtle.

Swim workouts often resemble the hardest running track workouts! While that is extreme, and the correct training answer for most athletes lies combines the prototypical cycling and swimming approaches, we really want athletes to think about developing their mechanical efficiency, since that is often the first limiter for speed development (see article here). However, that relationship starts to break down for very high VO2-max athletes, who barely need to reinforce the adaptations at all. In some cases where high talent meets high durability, they can excel through being treated like indestructible aerobic machines.

The workouts below try to balance those competing demands. As long as ~80% of your training is easy or steady (ideally half of the time being very easy in Zone 1 and half easy to easy/moderate in Zone 2), you can have fun with these workouts, doing one per week after the base is developed, or 2 per week for advanced athletes. Workouts 1 through 6 are good for a mid-week session; Workouts 7 through 9 are great in long runs. You can chop any of these workouts in half for less stressful sessions, or add 25% for a rare supercompensation stimulus. When in doubt, always err on the side of the least amount of stress possible to spur adaptation, even for pro athletes.

RELATED: Easy/Moderate Fartlek Workouts For Improving Endurance

Workout 1: Smooth speed development via 1/1s

Advanced: 3 miles easy, 16-20 x 1 minute fast/1 minute easy (think 10k effort to start, progressing to 5k effort or faster as you go and finishing smooth and fast), 4 minutes easy, 4 x 30-second hills fast (can push), 3 miles easy

Intermediate: 2-3 miles easy, 8-12 x 1 minute fast/90 seconds easy (same effort), 3 minutes easy, 4 x 30-second hills fast, 2-3 miles easy

Track application: 3 miles easy, 4 x (4 x 400 fast with 200 easy recoveries) with 400 easy between sets (same effort), 4 x 150 fast with 250 easy recoveries (push a bit), 2-3 miles easy

Every athlete we have ever coached is acquainted with 1-minute intervals. It’s like M. Night Shyamalan having a twist at the end of his movies, or Tarantino having an unnecessary close-up of feet. These types of short intervals are wonderful tools because unless an athlete really overdoes it and fully sprints, they won’t spend too much time in Zone 5, but they’ll be spending a lot of time at Critical Velocity and faster. The hills at the end get full muscular recruitment, something that the intervals may miss–they may almost feel like a plyometric session.

To level up the aerobic strain, keep the easy recoveries as a bit of a “float,” something just above easy effort. That prevents you from going too hard in the intervals and adds threshold work to the session, which is great during base builds. A float-focused 1/1 workout will often have athletes averaging marathon pace or faster for the entire session, including the recoveries!

We almost always start speed work within training blocks with a workout like this (usually after introducing hill workouts). I think that an athlete who repeated this session weekly could continue to improve as long as their aerobic stress is high enough from easy running and a more moderate long run.

RELATED: Anytime, Anyplace Trail Running Workouts

Workout 2: Critical Velocity

Advanced: 3 miles easy, 8-12 x 2-3 minutes fast/90 seconds easy (think 10k effort, with light progression in the 2nd half of the workout on good days), 3 minutes easy, 4 x 30-second hills fast, 2-3 miles easy

Intermediate: 2-3 miles easy, 5/4/3/2/1 minutes fast with 2 minutes easy recovery (think 10k effort with light progression toward 5k effort), 4 x 30 second hills fast, 2-3 miles easy

Track application: 3 miles easy, 5 x 800/400/200 with 400 easy after the 8, 200 easy after the 4, and 400 easy after the 2s (think 10k/5k/3k), 2-3 miles easy

We generally try to avoid having athletes do too many intervals that are longer than 3 minutes without strict intensity control. The problem was demonstrated in a 2020 study that looked at the training practices of 85 of the best runners in the world over 7 years. The researchers found that long intervals had the lowest correlation with long-term growth of any training element by a substantial margin (defined as intervals beyond 1 kilometer).

What were they seeing? While the answer is uncertain, my guess is that the long intervals can create lactate storms that curtail aerobic development, unless they are accompanied by extreme pacing discipline as seen in Norwegian training approaches. You can visualize the problem:

5 x 6 minutes at threshold/critical velocity (think 10k effort or so, depending on fitness level) is great aerobic stress.

5 x 6 minutes at VO2 max (pushing as hard as you can given the duration) will end your bloodline and archaeologists will only be able to hypothesize that you existed from your MRI reports.

This type of workout is the sweet spot, with a big quantity of work at moderately fast paces around 10k effort (with faster athletes going a bit easier, beginner athletes going a bit harder), but without pushing deep into the pain cave (where aerobic adaptations go to die). Save this session for when fitness is well-developed, with some hill workouts and 1/1s under your belt. You can get creative with workout structure, even breaking things up into sets (like 3-4 x 3/2/1 minutes fast), with the general goal of getting 15 to 30 minutes of relaxed intervals with smooth recoveries.

A cue I love for athletes on big interval workouts like this: maintain high cadence as you fatigue. While power may go down as an athlete gets tired, cadence can stay high and be a backstop against excessive fades. Just make sure the first couple of intervals err on the side of easier–progression throughout the session is better for the aerobic system, and it’s more fun. I’d rather an athlete go 30% too easy on a big interval session than 1% too hard. You can float these intervals as well for a more tempo-heavy session.

Workout 3: Hill power/tempo combo

Advanced: 3 miles easy, 12 x 45-60 second hills fast (think 5k, progressing to 3k effort) with run down recovery, 10-20 minutes moderate (think 1-hour effort), 1-2 miles easy

Intermediate: 2-3 miles easy, 8 x 30-45 second hills fast (think 3k), 10 min moderate (think 10k), 2-3 miles easy

Track Application: 3 miles easy, 10 x 300 fast (think 5k, progressing toward 3k) with 300 easy to float recovery, 2 miles moderate, 2-3 miles easy

Now we’re working on multiple different systems! I’m so fancy, you already know. The short hills are power-based–while they will get into Zone 5, it’s just a short time around there and will only be a couple of percent of a weekly intensity distribution. You’ll see similar workouts common for Norwegian athletes with shorter hills, likely to reinforce absolute power in the context of a training plan that mostly focuses on aerobic development.

After the hills, the moderate tempo is a supercharged aerobic stress. The legs will be tired, so you will be running on oxygen transport and grit. With fitness growth, this type of session gets massively easier, and it’s one of those indicator workouts that shows how well-developed an athlete’s threshold is (and can serve as a field test for fatigue resistance).

This workout is perfect for the later stages of a build phase, when you want to sustain power but also focus on aerobic system development. We see that athletes who can excel in the tempo after the hills are able to race incredibly strongly at events half-marathon and above.

RELATED: Why You Should Jog the Recovery in Interval Workouts

Workout 4: Hill capacity

Advanced: 3 miles easy, 6 x 3-minute hills mod/hard (think 5k effort) with run down recovery after each, 3 miles easy to easy/moderate

Intermediate: 2-3 miles easy, 4-5 x 3 minute hills mod/hard (think 5k), 2-3 miles easy

Track Application: 3 miles easy, 8 x 800 meters at 5k effort with 400 easy recovery, 2-3 miles easy

3-minute hills are the desert-island workouts for both Megan and I. We’re talking power with the climbing, VO2 max with the aerobic system, neuromuscular development with the sheer difficulty of it. Given that it’s on hills, it’s safe for any time of year due to lower impact, just leave it off any pure base-building block since it’s very hard. Doing this type of workout too often risks creating a Polarized training plan, with excessive intensity for aerobic development, so work these types of extremely difficult sessions in for boosts within well-designed training blocks.

Most workouts should be intensity-controlled and fun. But occasionally, you need to throw all caution to the wind and crush some workout bitches.

Hill workouts can be adjusted for intervals between 1 and 4 minutes, thinking 12-20 minutes of total intervals with run down recovery. For advanced athletes, they can experiment with progressing to steady running afterward. That Zone 3 work after the maximal hill power is another chance for major aerobic development. And you may notice something very weird–some athletes report their paces coming much easier after the hills! That likely has to do with the central governor, and the brain recalibrating what “hard” feels like. How cool is that?!

Workout 5: Threshold intervals with speed combo (double workout option)

Advanced: 3 miles easy, 5 x 6 minutes moderate (think 10k effort or a bit easier) with 3 minutes easy recovery, 5 x 30 seconds fast/1 min easy, 2-3 miles easy

Intermediate: 2-3 miles easy, 4 x 5 minutes moderate (think 10k effort) with 3 minutes easy recovery, 4 x 30 seconds fast/90 seconds easy, 2-3 miles easy

Track Application: 3 miles easy, 6 x 1 mile moderate (think 10k effort) with 400 easy recovery, 5 x 200 fast/200 slow, 2-3 miles easy

Time to take some risks! These longer intervals are high-risk, high-reward. Go too hard, and it could be excessive for recovery and adaptation, leading to a peaking process that requires a training recalibration. But nail the effort between ~Critical Velocity and threshold, and it’s the ultimate aerobic-system stimulus. The fast strides to end are the reward for all that effort-discipline!

For a truly sexy wrinkle, advanced athletes can add a SECOND WORKOUT on a day with an AM session like this. The Norwegians often do workouts like 15-20 x 1 minute on/1 minute off on top of an AM threshold session, with the efforts controlled as well. We save that sort of thing for pros during build blocks when they are not racing, but it’s a worthwhile experiment for any extremely durable athlete that finds themselves stagnating.

If you do a double workout, with two sessions in one day, we just ask that you have a good health insurance policy first. We’re talking a gold or platinum plan, only. If you’re bronze-level with Blue Cross/Blue Shield, stick with one workout a day. It’s suboptimal when training theory goes from a fun experiment to personal bankruptcy.

Workout 6: Hill strength

Advanced: 3 miles easy, 10/8/6/4/2 minute hills mod/hard with run down recovery after each, 3 miles easy

Intermediate: 2-3 miles easy, 8/6/4/2 minute hills mod/hard with run down recovery after each, 2-3 miles easy

Track Application: Run from the track to a big hill

Oh hell yeah, now we are talking HILL BEAST! This workout is the best for trail race readiness, anytime in the 6-8 weeks before key events (or for perverse fun in any build phase). The uphills are important, sure. But the emulsion with the downhills is what creates the tasty umami flavor! The up-and-down stimulus absolutely fries the quads, and will prepare them for anything on race day. If your race has a lot of climbing and descending, you can make this workout so steep that your nose caresses the trail in front of you.

To really level this session up, after the final 2 minute hill, turn around and run back up for 3 minutes ALL OUT. We call it our fatigue resistance monster session with that bonus, since your body has to reach deep into the cellular crevasses to find whatever is left to power that effort. It might not be fun, but the athlete that comes out the other end is capable of magic on race day.

It hurts, though. The Hill Beast is when running for fun becomes more like training BDSM. Make sure you’re into that sort of thing first, and always have a safe word.

Workout 7: Threshold tempo with speed combo

Advanced: 3 miles easy, 20-30 min moderately hard (think 1-hour effort, with option to end harder), 5 minutes easy, 5 x 1 min fast/1 min easy (smooth flow), 2-3 miles easy

Intermediate: 2-3 miles easy, 15-20 min moderately hard (think 1-hour effort), 5 min easy, 5 x 45 second hills fast (think 3k), 2-3 miles easy

Track Application: 3 miles easy, 4 x 2k moderately hard (think 1-hour effort) with 400 float recovery, 5 x 200 fast with 200 easy recovery (smooth flow), 2-3 miles easy

A bread-and-butter workout for every athlete is the threshold tempo. Generally, tempos consist of 15-30 minutes around an effort you could sustain for about 1 hour, starting moderate and getting harder by the end. These workouts involve threshold training at its purest, an aerobic stimulus that is beneficial for athletes racing 1 mile or athletes racing 100 miles due to how it helps the body shuttle lactate during exercise. You can include float recoveries to break up the tempo as well if you find your pace fades due to fatigue–so the 30-minute tempo can be 3 x 10 minutes with a three-minute float recovery, or similar.

The addition of speed or power at the end adds a neuromuscular and mechanical stimulus that helps that aerobic stress get in the context of high output. We don’t just want aerobic beasts. We want aerobic beasts who are fast as heck.

For all athletes, threshold tempos are good to insert into long runs year-round every few weeks. We theorize that doing some tempo to start long runs may improve adaptations, but require fewer total miles (and the injury risk that comes along with it). However, if you’re doing the tempo within a long run, don’t mess around with the speed, since the main goal is aerobic development.

Workout 8: Pure tempo

Advanced: 2 miles easy, 45-60 min moderately hard (think half marathon effort, ending hard in some cases), 2 miles easy

Intermediate: 2 miles easy, 30-45 min moderately hard (think 1-hour effort), 2 miles easy

Track Application: Don’t. Though tempos are great for track athletes over hilly terrain!

Oh yes, this is the good stuff. The pure tempo sessions are running at its purest–go out there and run kinda hard for a kinda long time. These longer tempos are best saved for a race prep period when the specific stress of sustaining fast paces is most useful.

The ultimate pure tempo is the POWER HOUR, 1 hour seeing what you’re made of (in a controlled way). We save those types of sessions for just once or twice a training block even in advanced athletes, since they are mentally and physically demanding, and you don’t want to do them without fitness already built up. Training races like 10ks or half marathons fit into this bucket too! Split the tempo into intervals like 5 x 8 minutes with 2 minutes easy recovery if you do these sessions often, to prevent excessive stress and fatigue accumulation.

Workout 9: Aerobic monster tempo

Advanced: within a long run, do 90 min to 2 hours moderate starting around 50k effort, finishing harder

Intermediate: within a long run, do 1 hour moderate around marathon effort

Track Application: Double dog don’t. Though it’s great off the track for long runs!

If you read the training articles on Kilian Jornet or Eliud Kipchoge, you probably noticed a unifying workout–the long tempo within a long run. Look across the training plans of the world’s best, and it’s a pretty common thing to see. Long runs aren’t just slow, at least during focused training builds. Especially as an athlete develops toward their potential, they often involve focused progression over an excruciatingly long time.

This focused steady running is good to introduce into long runs after a base period every month or so (with a higher density for athletes that recover fast or those training for marathons). The Zone 3/4 aerobic work is burly and tough, and it’s shocking how much easier it gets after one or two tries. We have seen these tempos have a strong correlation with ultra performance as well.

For athletes training for road marathons where there is an outsized demand on running economy, it’s best to split up this quantity of work into shorter bouts to make it easier to maintain pace. Examples include 5/4/3/2/1 miles at marathon effort with 1 mile float recovery, 3 x 4 miles with 1 mile float recovery, and 2 x 6 miles at marathon effort with 1 mile float recovery.

A hypothetical long-run build for an advanced trail/ultra athlete we coach outside of specific training might look like this:

Week 1: Easy/mod long run (20-30 min moderately hard after warm-up)

Week 2: Easy/mod long run (1 hour moderate, or pushing uphills throughout depending on route)

Week 3: Easy/mod long run with option to push to steady

Week 4: Easy long run

Repeat!

Final Message

The goal of this article was just to give you some ideas to incorporate into your training. You can adjust any of these sessions a ton, since there is no magic in the specifics. Just always come back to the 2 big goals of workouts: aerobic development and improving mechanical/neuromuscular output. How can you balance those priorities optimally with overall stress levels given your goals and background? Aerobic development is most important, but you always want to make sure your aerobic system is growing within a mechanical/muscular context that leads to each breath of oxygen leading to more power generation.

Layer those types of sessions together with lots of easy running and cross-training, and the sky is the limit. But the key message to remember: even though you may do some workouts, the goal is always PLAY. Whatever sounds the most fun to you will likely be the workout that leads to the most long-term growth, too.

And that’s the message to aspiring coaches out there too (including the future coaches who don’t know it yet). Learn what you can, but don’t put pressure on yourself to know everything, because no one does. Put in the work, but keep it fun. By playing in your approach to coaching, learning from everyone you can while incorporating your unique background and perspective, you may find yourself playing at the margins of human performance in ways that old coaches like me could never anticipate.

Just promise me that you’ll write about what you learn so that I can take notes.

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/14/disappointment-after-potential-alzheimers-drug-fails-roche-trial-gantenerumab,Disappointment after potential Alzheimer’s drug fails Roche trial,"Hopes of a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease have been dealt another blow by the failure of an experimental drug to slow the progression of the condition in global clinical trials.

The Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche said its drug, gantenerumab, showed no clear benefit in twin trials which explored its impact on memory, problem solving and other cognitive skills in people with early stage Alzheimer’s.

Experts had hoped for positive news from Roche’s Graduate 1 and 2 clinical trials after a US-Japanese collaboration between Biogen and Eisai reported in September that a similar drug, lecanemab, slowed cognitive decline in patients, making it the first proven to do so.

“This news is very disappointing to deliver,” said Levi Garraway, Roche’s chief medical officer in a statement.

Gantenerumab is an antibody therapy designed to bind to clumps of amyloid beta proteins and remove the plaques from the brain. The abnormal protein aggregates are believed to play a major role in Alzheimer’s, though many patients are likely to have multiple disease processes at work in their brains.

Roche conducted two identical phase 3 trials of gantenerumab, with about 1,000 volunteers in each receiving an injection of the drug or a placebo every two weeks. The participants took part in tests to monitor their cognitive decline for more than two years.

While those given the drug showed a relative reduction in clinical decline of 8% and 6% on the Graduate 1 and 2 trials respectively, the results were not statistically reliable, the company said. Roche released the main outcomes of the trials on Monday and will give more details at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease conference in San Francisco on 30 November.

Rachelle Doody, Roche’s head of neurodegeneration, told Reuters the drug was less effective at removing amyloid than expected. “We will be showing that there is a relationship between the lowering of amyloid and the clinical outcomes. It’s just that when you don’t get the amyloid lowering that you expected you won’t get the clinical outcome that you expected.”

“Any large scale clinical trial of an Alzheimer’s drug that fails is a massive disappointment to patients,” said Prof Jonathan Schott, a neurologist at UCL’s Dementia Research Centre and chief medical officer at Alzheimer’s Research UK. “This is a particular disappointment because gantenerumab is given as a subcutaneous injection, which would have made it easier to administer than the infusions needed for most other anti-amyloid drugs.”

Dr Richard Oakley, associate director of research at Alzheimer’s Society, said: “These results today are disappointing, as we don’t currently have a drug for Alzheimer’s disease in the UK which slows down its progression. However, this is still an exciting time for dementia research, with promising early results from a similar Alzheimer’s drug, lecanemab, and 143 other drugs currently in clinical trials aiming to slow down the disease or help with symptoms.”

“Alzheimer’s Society research over 30 years ago was pivotal in highlighting the importance of amyloid protein in the development of Alzheimer’s disease – laying the basis for these drugs being tested today. But it’s so important to remember we need research into other types of dementia as these drugs are only for Alzheimer’s disease,” he added.",['Ian Sample'],2022-11-14 00:00:00

Summary

Summary Companies Biogen, Eisai report landmark result for experimental drug

Nearly all Alzheimer's trials have failed previously

Drugs from Roche and Eli Lilly target the same protein as Biogen, Eisai compound

Shares of all four drugmakers soar on news















LONDON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The results of a key Alzheimer's drug trial on Wednesday have reignited decades-old hopes that targeting a particular protein helps arrest the progression of the fatal brain disease, giving a big boost to similar studies being run by Roche and Eli Lilly.

Eisai Co Ltd (4523.T) and Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) said their experimental drug significantly slowed cognitive and functional decline in a large trial of patients in the early stages of the disease, a rare positive outcome in a field littered with failure.

The drug, lecanemab, slowed progress of the brain-wasting disease by 27% compared with a placebo, offering the promise of an effective treatment to desperate patients and their families.

The read-out is supportive of a longstanding but controversial theory that removal of sticky deposits of a protein called amyloid beta from the brains of people with Alzheimer's can delay the progression of the most common form of dementia, which affects an estimated 55 million people globally.

Nearly all Alzheimer's drugs, including those targeting amyloid, have stumbled in trials.

Dr. Kristian Steen Frederiksen, director of a clinical trial unit at the University of Copenhagen said the latest data was solid evidence that amyloid beta is not just an ""innocent bystander"" in the development of dementia drugs.

Prospects of other high-profile anti-amyloid drugs currently undergoing clinical trials, including Roche's (ROG.S) gantenerumab and Eli Lilly's donanemab, are higher as a result of the Biogen-Eisai data, analysts said.

""Investor expectations (for rival studies) will certainly rise, as very few would assign a likelihood of success >50% for these trials considering the graveyard of past failures,"" said Daniel Chancellor, healthcare analyst at Citeline.

Late-stage data on gantenerumab is expected by the fourth quarter, Roche said in a statement, saying it was encouraged by the lecanemab data.

Lilly said it remained confident in its donanemab development programme. Results of a key late-stage trial testing the drug are anticipated by mid-2023.

Alzheimer's researchers have suggested success for one or more of the three drugs is likely to invigorate research across the entire field, if the results withstand scrutiny.

Biogen's stock surged 35.4% in early U.S. trading while shares of Eisai jumped 17% to the daily limit in Tokyo. Lilly and Roche's stock rose between 6% and 7%.

AMYLOID HYPOTHESIS

Some researchers, including Frederiksen, are cautiously optimistic about the impact the Biogen, Eisai data has on the likelihood of success for the other two drugs in development.

The three experimental drugs differ in terms of which types of amyloid beta they bind to, and there are differences in trial designs, and potentially safety profiles, he said.

""We've learned lately not to get our hopes up too much,"" said Tara Spires-Jones, deputy director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh.

Scientists also caution there are many brain changes implicated in Alzheimer's in addition to amyloid, and that some of the other targets being explored are more likely to work for people who have established dementia.

Alzheimer's is a complex disorder, and only targeting amyloid may not be enough, said Miia Kivipelto, professor of clinical geriatrics at the Karolinska Institutet Center for Alzheimer Research.

An individualised treatment approach as is the case with cancer is likely needed, she said.

The so-called amyloid hypothesis has been challenged by some scientists, particularly after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's controversial approval of Aduhelm in 2021 based on its plaque-clearing ability rather than proof that it helped slow cognitive decline. The decision came after the FDA's own panel of outside experts had advised against approval.

""This (latest data) will certainly make the strongest proponents of the amyloid hypothesis very happy and may dampen the arguments of the strongest critics,"" said Spires-Jones.

https://pharmaphorum.com/news/roches-head-of-pharma-bill-anderson-heads-for-exit,Roche's head of pharma Bill Anderson heads for exit,"Roche announced this morning that its head of pharmaceuticals, Bill Anderson, is leaving the company to pursue ""other opportunities"" after four years in the role.

[caption id=""attachment_103834"" align=""alignright"" width=""117""] Bill Anderson[/caption]

Anderson will be replaced in the interim as chief executive of Roche Pharma by Thomas Schinecker – currently head of Roche Diagnostics – after he steps down on 1 January. Schinecker had already been scheduled to pass the reins of the diagnostics unit to Matt Sause on the same day and replace Severin Schwann as CEO of the Roche group in mid-March.

Roche said in a statement that a permanent successor for Anderson is due to be named by the time Schinecker takes up the top job.

""Over his 16-year career at Roche, Bill Anderson has demonstrated excellent leadership,"" said Schwann. ""He has been instrumental in shaping Roche's transformation and I wish him all the best for the future.""

Anderson joined Roche's Genentech division in 2006 as head of its immunology and ophthalmology business unit, after nine years at Biogen that culminated in a two-year stint as head of neurology. He rose to the position of head of global product strategy at Roche in 2013, before taking the CEO role at Genentech in 2017 and then group head pharma in January 2019.

There's no word yet on where Anderson will continue his career, but a CEO role at a biotech company seems a likely destination.

He has been a lynchpin of Roche's diversification away from oncology into areas like multiple sclerosis and haemophilia, and managed a particularly severe patent cliff as the group lost exclusivity for big selling antibodies for cancer and immunological diseases.

Roche also confirmed in its update that Schwan will be proposed as the company's new chairman at its annual general meeting in March, replacing Christoph Franz who has decided not to seek re-election to the role.

It also announced the promotion of Silke Hörnstein, currently global head of strategy and transformation at the diagnostics division.

As of April, she will become head of corporate strategy for the group, as well as joining the corporate executive committee as secretary.",[],

La Roche-Posay has been pioneering dermatology since its creation in 1975, working in close partnership with dermatologists.

Beyond its products, La Roche-Posay aims to make dermatology accessible to people through health tech. In 2016, the brand launched the first stretchable skin sensor to monitor UV exposure. In 2019, La Roche-Posay launched Effaclar Spotscan, the first web app co-developed by dermatologists and based on artificial intelligence to analyze acne-prone skin and provide personalized advice and recommendations. Additionally, the brand introduced My Skin Track UV in partnership with Apple, a battery-free wearable sensor and companion app to measure UV, pollution, pollen and humidity exposure and provide personalised advice.",[],
https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/comment/roche-wet-amd/,A game of two halves for Roche’s recently approved wet AMD assets,"Of late, it seemed that all the stars had aligned well for Roche in the wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) space. With Susvimo (ranibizumab sustained release) winning US FDA approval last year, followed by an FDA approval for Vabysmo (faricimab) this year, Roche had all the right assets to take the game to the current market leader, Regeneron and Bayer’s Eylea (aflibercept), at an accelerated pace. However, that pace is likely to slow down after Susvimo was voluntarily recalled due to a manufacturing defect; the recall was announced on 18 October during an investor call.

Susvimo’s recall is due to a problem related to the seal on the port delivery device, which keeps the medicine from leaking out once it has been injected. Susvimo is an implant that is inserted into the eye to enable continuous release of ranibizumab, and refilled every 24 weeks. The frequency of administration associated with Susvimo represents a significant advancement over other anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies that are more commonly used. The latter set of therapies need to be administered on a more-frequent basis, most of them every eight weeks on average, leading to a significant treatment burden.

The need for therapies that can help to prolong treatment intervals for patients with wAMD is an area that pharmaceutical companies continue to focus on for this indication. In that sense, Susvimo represents a significant advancement compared to current standards of care. However, there are a number of caveats associated with this therapy. For one, the need to insert this implant via a surgical route represents a resource-intensive procedure and is likely to limit its wider adoption in the market. In addition, the Susvimo implant is associated with a higher rate of endophthalmitis compared to monthly injections of Lucentis (ranibizumab). These are factors that will be taken into consideration before a patient and physician decide on whether to opt for this therapy, and are likely to be further exacerbated with the latest recall. However, there is no taking away the fact that Susvimo will be of significant value, especially to a select population that requires regular treatment and has demonstrated a good response to anti-VEGF therapy.

Vabysmo, on the other hand, represents a more accessible therapy for patients with wAMD and presents Roche with a therapy that has the potential to compete directly against Eylea. Vabysmo is administered every four weeks for the first four doses, and this frequency may be reduced to as little as twice a year thereafter, depending on results of optical coherence tomography and visual acuity evaluations. That is a significant improvement over the current formulation of Eylea, which needs to be administered every eight to ten weeks, on average. However, Regeneron reported last month that results from a pivotal clinical trial evaluating high-dose Eylea in wAMD patients demonstrated that 77% of patients were maintained on 16-week dosing intervals. While the longer-acting therapies score a definite win for patients and physicians, it is also anticipated that the competition between Roche and Regeneron to win patient shares for this indication with newer formulations will be fierce and one to watch.",['Globaldata Healthcare'],2022-10-21 10:43:20+00:00
https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/fda-grants-eua-to-roche-s-real-time-pcr-test-for-monkeypox-virus,FDA Grants EUA to Roche's Real Time PCR Test for Monkeypox Virus,"The FDA has granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Roche’s cobas monkeypox virus (MPXV) real time PCR test to use on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems for the detection of monkeypox. The test is used for the qualitative detection of DNA from MPXV in lesion swabs taken from those with suspected MPVX infection by their health care provider.

cobas MPXV targets 2 different regions of the MPXV genome that are less prone to mutations than other parts of the genome. The dual-targeting system allows the cobas MPXV test to detect the virus regardless of whether a mutation occurs in either of the target regions, according to Roche.

“When multiple clusters of monkeypox virus infection were initially reported in countries where the disease is not endemic, Roche was among the first companies to address virus concerns with test kits,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO of Roche Diagnostics, in a press release. ""In order to meet the testing needs and workflow demands of laboratories as well as expand access to safe and reliable diagnostic solutions, we developed the cobas MPXV on the fully automated and high-throughput cobas 6800/8800 system.""

The cobas 6800/8800 Systems are able to produce results in 3 and a half hours, providing up to 96 results in approximately 3 hours with a total of 1440 results for the cobas 6800 System and 4128 results for the cobas 8800 System in 24 hours, according to Roche. The EUA for the high-throughput test will enable individuals to obtain quick test results to spare them from unnecessary additional testing or isolation. It will also enable patients to access the appropriate treatment as soon as possible.

The symptoms of MPVX include fever, chills, headaches, muscle aches, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and a painful rash typically presenting as raised bumps on the skin of the face, extremities, and genitals. The bumps typically fill with pus and fluid as the disease progresses and before they eventually ulcerate, scab and fall off. However, MPVX is not able to be conclusively diagnosed by symptoms alone because many of these symptoms are similar to other rash-producing illnesses, such as chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, and even hives or allergies.

cobas MPXV is the first monkeypox test granted an EUA after an evaluation in actual patient samples instead of samples developed in a laboratory. The assay uses β-globin, a target found in human DNA, as an endogenous control to ensure specimen adequacy.

“Unlike the previously cleared assay, cobas MPXV detects monkeypox nucleic acids and the endogenous control in the same well, improving laboratory efficiency by effectively doubling the number of clinical samples a laboratory can assess on each plate and halving reagent needs per sample,” Roche said in a press release.

The test is only for use under the FDA’s EUA in laboratories that are certified under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments meeting the requirements to perform high or moderate complexity tests. The cobas MPXV test is intended for use by qualified clinical laboratory personnel who are specifically trained on the techniques for real-time PCR and for use with the cobas 6800/8800 Systems.

These patients with HER2 low status may now be eligible for a targeted treatment, which could significantly improve their outcomes. 1,2

The PATHWAY anti-HER2 (4B5) test is the only FDA approved companion diagnostic indicated as an aid in the assessment of HER2 low status in metastatic breast cancer patients. These patients may now consider ENHERTU as a treatment option based on the results of the Phase 3 DESTINY-Breast04 trial.3

Basel, 4 October 2022 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the PATHWAY anti-HER2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody* to identify metastatic breast cancer patients with low HER2 expression for whom ENHERTU® (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) may be considered as a targeted treatment. ENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo.

HER2 is a receptor protein that helps cancer cells grow quickly. To determine a patient’s HER2 status, pathologists evaluate, or score, the level of HER2 receptor protein expressed in breast cancer tissue samples. If a patient's tumour expresses high levels of HER2, the patient is identified as HER2-positive and may be considered for HER2-targeted treatment. However, half of all patients with metastatic breast cancer express low levels of HER2 which historically classified them as HER2-negative.

The PATHWAY anti-HER2 (4B5) test now includes a scoring algorithm that helps pathologists to identify “low expressors” of HER2, assigning a HER2 low status to this group of patients. With this lower cutoff, the test is able to identify patients who may benefit from ENHERTU as a treatment option.

“Roche is proud to lead the way in HER2 diagnostics through critical innovations that support the identification of patients who may benefit from novel HER2-targeted therapies,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO of Roche Diagnostics. “Previously, metastatic breast cancer patients with a lower level of HER2 expression were considered to be part of the HER2-negative population and had no HER2-targeted treatment options. Now, they may be eligible for a HER2-targeted therapy, significantly increasing the number of patients who could have improved outcomes.”

The PATHWAY anti-HER2 (4B5) test was used as part of the DESTINY-Breast04 trial sponsored by AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo to identify patients whose tumours expressed low levels of HER2 protein. The trial reported a 50% reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death and an overall gain of six months over standard of care in patients treated with ENHERTU whose tumours had low levels of HER2 expression.

Breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases diagnosed worldwide each year. More than 620,000 people die from breast cancer every year.4,5

The FDA approval of the new HER2 low indication expands on the intended use for Roche’s proven, on-market PATHWAY anti-HER2 (4B5) test, delivering timely, clear and confident results. The launch exemplifies Roche’s commitment to continuing to innovate integrated, high medical value solutions that help to advance personalised healthcare.

https://www.roche.com/stories/making-sense-alzheimers,Deciphering Alzheimer’s clinical endpoints,"Finding the right tools to measure what matters most to people living with Alzheimer’s and care partners does present challenges, but researchers have developed a combination of sensitive tools to help us do this.

Alzheimer’s disease is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disease that leads to severe memory impairment as well as behaviour and social challenges, with individuals eventually losing the ability to undertake everyday tasks and function independently.

Across different individuals and across disease stages, the disease progresses at different speeds. For example, people in the early stages of the disease often progress slowly while people in later, more moderate stages may get worse at a faster rate. So identifying and measuring a meaningful treatment outcome can depend on multiple factors. In developing potential new treatments for the early stages of this disease, finding the right tools to measure what matters most to people living with Alzheimer’s and care partners does present challenges, but researchers have developed a combination of sensitive tools to help us do this.

Measuring what matters to people impacted by Alzheimer’s Disease: cognition and function

For people living with Alzheimer’s and their care partners, what’s often reported as some of the most important treatment outcomes are improving memory, slowing or stopping disease progression and retaining their ability to participate in daily activities, and maintaining their interests.1 Clinicians who treat people living with Alzheimer’s refer to many of these features in two main categories: cognition (related to memory and thinking) and function (related to performing daily activities).

Until recently, only symptomatic treatments for Alzheimer’s disease were available – medicines that temporarily ease the ways in which the disease manifests without addressing the underlying disease process. Now, novel disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) are being evaluated in large clinical trials in people with early symptomatic stages of Alzheimer’s disease. While DMTs are not expected to improve specific symptoms, the hope and goal for current DMTs under investigation is to slow disease progression and thereby the cumulative loss of cognition and function.

Alzheimer’s disease includes unique and compounded challenges for demonstrating treatment benefits compared to some other conditions. It develops and progresses over decades compared to other diseases that progress and present initial symptoms more dramatically, and then progress much more rapidly like infections and cancer. In the earlier stages of Alzheimer’s disease, the rate of disease progression on any given measurement scale can be slow, making it difficult to detect a difference from day to day, week to week, or month to month. In clinical trial settings, researchers have identified a series of sensitive scales and tests in order to develop a more complete picture of how a potential treatment may affect a person’s life across different areas. This includes looking at how people living with Alzheimer’s are able to go about their day-to-day activities such as organising calendar activities, pursuing hobbies, or getting to where they need to go in the community. These tests and measures reflect multiple experiences and perspectives of people living with the disease, and sometimes include input from their care partners and clinicians.

The biological impact from newer DMTs is promising. Most have demonstrated a reduction of key biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s – beta-amyloid, tau and neurofilament light, among others. The central question is whether those changes to the underlying biology of Alzheimer’s will translate into meaningful differences in a person’s life. That’s why it’s important to use instruments that may be sensitive enough to detect specific changes in cognition and function relevant to daily life when designing clinical trials in earlier stages of Alzheimer’s disease.

Breaking down Alzheimer’s benchmarks

There are a variety of clinical outcome assessments and tools the Alzheimer’s field is using to evaluate and quantify the therapeutic effect of potential new DMTs. The volume, complexity and overlap of these measures can be confusing.

Alzheimer’s disease clinical outcome assessments

Most clinical outcome assessments are validated questionnaires that include information from patients, care partners and clinicians that collectively assess a therapeutic effect.",[],

https://www.labiotech.eu/trends-news/roche-covid-test-variant/,Roche launches COVID-19 test to detect emerging variant of interest,"Roche and its subsidiary TIB Molbiol have developed a COVID-19 test for researchers that detects and differentiates the latest sub-variant of interest BA.2.75.

The test specifically targets two of the known unique mutations in BA.2.75, which allows clear differentiation against other notable subvariants.

“Roche is pleased to have developed a test for researchers that provides insights into the epidemiology of BA.2.75, helping to understand its impact on public health,” said Cindy Perettie, head of molecular labs at Roche Diagnostics Solutions.

“Being able to differentiate emerging variants and understanding their similarities and mutations, can provide a basis for experts to make predictions of their spread and response to treatment strategies.”

Since it was first detected in India in May 2022, cases of BA.2.75 have been reported in more than a dozen countries. The BA.2.75 is a sub-variant related to the Omicron variant. The sub-variant is being monitored by both the World Health Organization as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It has not reached the level of a Variant of Concern, but differentiating it from BA.4 and BA.5 allows for improved tracking to understand how it is spreading.

The available research use only test, VirSNiP SARS-CoV-2 Spike 147E 152R, adds to the broad suite of COVID-19 test kits developed by Roche and TIB Molbiol, for instance for the detection of the recent BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants, as well as other mutations present in the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant.

Roche and TIB Molbiol’s researchers continue to work in collaboration with partners globally to continually screen for new variants and emerging diseases.

Today GSK made a bid to jump ahead, saying its own Tim3 MAb, cobolimab, had met criteria enabling it to begin the pivotal portion of the phase 2/3 Costar trial. Not only that, but in March Roche quietly discontinued enrolment into the RG7769 cohort of a combo study, suggesting that this asset, a bispecific Roche had prioritised last year, has been shelved. Cobolimab represents an important pillar of GSK’s tenuous attempt to regain an oncology presence, though little actual data are available to gauge whether this is a smart move. Sabatolimab’s phase 2 readout has been delayed, while Lilly discontinued LY3415233, a Tim3/PD-1 bispecific, in favour of the pure anti-Tim3 asset LY3321367. Costar combines cobolimab with Jemperli in post-PD-(L)1 NSCLC. Today GSK also trumpeted the success of a separate trial, Perla, comparing Jemperli head to head against Merck & Co’s Keytruda in front-line NSCLC. Here too the win is hard to gauge, however, as the primary measure was overall response, no survival data are available, and Perla “was not designed to demonstrate superiority” over Keytruda.

With this acquisition, Roche will gain rights to Good Therapeutics’ innovative, conditionally active, PD-1-regulated IL-2 program and an exclusive right to the platform technology for the development of PD-1-regulated IL-2 receptor agonist therapeutics.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Roche will make an upfront cash payment of $250 million for the shares on a fully diluted basis and additional payments based on the achievement of predetermined development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. The transaction is conditioned upon clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2022.

Following the close of the Roche acquisition, the Good Therapeutics team plans to apply the technology for the design of conditionally active therapeutics to other targets in immuno-oncology and beyond in a new company, Bonum Therapeutics.

“Good Therapeutics was founded to create a new class of conditionally active therapeutics that will be more effective and avoid the problem of systemic immune activation seen with previous versions of such drugs.

Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche Canada) has entered an agreement with the Canadian Government to supply Actemra IV (tocilizumab for injection) courses to treat adult Covid-19 patients.

Under the deal, the company will be responsible for the supply of 15,000 courses of treatment to the government for adult hospitalised Covid-19 patients.

The Canadian government is working with its provincial and territorial partners to allocate treatment courses across jurisdictions.

In October, Actemra IV received approval from Health Canada to treat hospitalised adult Covid-19 patients who are on systemic corticosteroids and need additional oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

The regulator recommended a single intravenous infusion of 8mg/kg Actemra dose given over 60 minutes for adult Covid-19 patients. Doses exceeding 800mg per infusion are not recommended in this patient group.

McMaster University Infectious Diseases physician and associate professor Dr Zain Chagla said: “Actemra has become a standard of care for moderate to severe Covid-19 patients requiring hospitalization, and this agreement allows for a stable supply of essential medications for the management of Covid-19.”

The treatment has been approved in several territories including Japan, Myanmar, Australia, Peru, Honduras, the EU, Ecuador, Ukraine, and the UK for treating severe or critical hospitalised Covid-19 patients.

Actemra has also been authorised for emergency use in the US and Ghana.

Roche estimates 429 adults will be eligible to receive treatment with tocilizumab for every 1000 hospitalised adult Covid-19 patients.

This may prevent 12 instances of invasive mechanical ventilation and 17 deaths.",['Hasini Devarasetti'],2022-12-02 07:34:34+00:00

Genentech (Roche)’s Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) stole the show at last month’s European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) meeting, particularly in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS).

The South San Francisco-based biotech made approximately 35 presentations involving Ocrevus, which is a key driver of Roche’s pharmaceutical division. The drug gained 16% in third-quarter sales, bringing in a total of $1.52 billion Swiss francs.

In an interview with BioSpace, Ashish Pradhan, M.D., executive director and disease area lead, neuroimmunology at Genentech noted that with MS there are two broad treatment strategies.

The first is escalation, which is the use of relatively older but now less effective therapies. This has been shown in head-to-head clinical trials, Pradhan said.

In some cases, physicians may start treatment with those drugs, and then “escalate” to a “highly effective therapy”, such as Ocrevus, if they do not get the response they’re looking for, he noted.

But increasingly, the treatment strategy is to start with the highly effective therapies, “so you hit the disease with the best therapy that you have and try to contain [it] as quickly and as effectively as possible without putting the patient through the process of starting on a less-effective therapy.”

What is important, within the context of some of these clinical studies, is that many patients may have been on less-effective treatments before shifting to newer therapies such as Ocrevus, “which also means that a number of years have passed since their diagnosis,” Pradhan said. This forms part of the basis for Genentech’s Phase IIIb ENSEMBLE trial.

The company presented two-year interim analysis from the open-label study at ECTRIMS. The trial evaluates the effectiveness and safety of the drug in patients with early-stage RRMS over 192 weeks with a follow-up period of at least 48 weeks.

After 96 weeks of treatment with Ocrevus, 77% of patients saw no evidence of disease activity (NEDA), the most standard accepted measure of disability. “They will, of course, be followed for another couple of years,” to determine the final results, Pradhan said.

“What particularly needs to be pointed out is that the EDSS [expanded disability status scale] score, which is a measure of disability, remained stable, or in some instances even showed some improvements in these patients,” he added.

Another study looked at long-term safety across all Ocrevus clinical trials over the last nine years. This safety research has been presented at almost every major MS-related conference since the drug was approved, Pradhan noted.

Genentech collects data from all of the studies as well as from various regulatory databases, and the company’s own Ocrevus website database, “which is the first in the industry,” he said. This particular presentation included approximately 250,000 people from all clinical trials that are ongoing. It looks at two predominant safety outcomes, serious infections and malignancies with a particular focus on female breast cancer.

Genentech has not seen any particular signal for a particular adverse event, Pradhan said, noting that this has been the case in previous instances.

The company plans to continue its vigilance program, as well as long-term studies such as ENSEMBLE, studies in pregnant women and the CHIMES trial in Black and Hispanic Americans.

Interim analysis from CHIMES was also presented at ECTRIMS. One-year data is expected to read out at some point in 2023.

“We demonstrated again that Ocrevus is effective in these populations, which are under-represented in clinical trials,” Pradhan said.

“We’re very proud to say that our commitment to this molecule continues unabated,” Pradhan said of Ocrevus. “It’s a very rich investigation program that is still ongoing and will continue for many years.”",[],
https://www.reporterherald.com/2023/02/13/larry-roche-bidens-presidency-has-been-a-failure-to-date,Larry Roche: Biden’s presidency has been a failure to date,"I was a regular contributor to the RH Open Forum during the previous election cycle, in an effort to inform (hopefully persuade) voters to consider conservative values and candidates in their voting decisions. As my efforts were important then, the conservative messages of lower taxes, smaller government, border security and less government spending are just as important now. Particularly as Congress is more balanced with a Republican-controlled House.

Last Tuesday, Biden delivered the State of the Union address. Since Biden’s last State of the Union address, we have seen many of our problems only get worse:

1) The immigration crisis. Since Biden was sworn into office, there have been an estimated 5.5 million “illegal” border crossings. In December alone, there were 251,487 illegal border encounters as reported by Customs and Border Patrol. The largest number ever recorded! The border crisis started the minute Biden took office. The immigration problem began at the border towns, but the whole country is now feeling the effects of the illegal immigration crisis. The border situation has contributed to large quantities of illicit drugs (fentanyl) coming into America. The drug cartels are thriving on our feckless border policies and enforcement. With DHS Director Alejandro Mayorkas saying the border is secure, Biden’s cleaned up and manicured visit to El Paso, and their excuse for the border crisis being that “Biden is a victim of circumstances,” it is hard not to believe the border crisis isn’t just incompetence but intentional.

2) Growing debt. Both Democrat and Republican administrations have failed to control spending and the national debt. Unfortunately, Biden has taken spending to a whole new debt level. The United States started 2023 fiscal year with a national debt of more than $31 trillion, having increased by about $4 trillion since Biden’s arrival in the White House. The Democrat controlled lame-duck Congress just passed a massive $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill in December. A United States debt disaster isn’t here yet, but it isn’t that far away.

3) Inflation. Fortunately inflation is slowing largely due to falling rent, used car prices and some relief at the gas pump. The current CPI inflation rate is 6.5%. But don’t look at the price of your electricity and natural gas bills going down anytime soon. While the U.S. has low unemployment for now, inflation and the cost of living is resulting in a lower standard of living for the average American family. As reported by the Heritage Foundation, the average American family has lost $7,100 in purchasing power during the Biden presidency. While Biden celebrates a rise in take-home pay during his presidency, it has been nullified by rising inflation. Biden likes to chant “inflation is coming down”; however, prices are still rising, just not as fast as before.

4) Scandal. The most recent revelation of the Biden presidency is the discovery that he had classified documents from when he was vice president. Does Biden hold himself to the same standard he held Trump? Biden said he couldn’t believe how “anyone could be that irresponsible” to keep classified documents. Before Biden was elected president, there were questions about influence peddling by his son, Hunter Biden, to enrich himself. There are serious questions about if President Biden was in the know about Hunter’s influence peddling. Remember the “Big Guy”?

5) Unity. Biden in his inauguration speech spoke of unity and a return to normalcy. Biden’s idea of unity was to portray half of the country as evil, anti-democratic extremists, identifying MAGA Republicans as an existential threat to the country. Biden doubled down on his contempt for his critics with a polarizing speech in front of a hellish red background in Philadelphia. At times, it is difficult to believe if Biden really believes what he is saying. Biden is right that we are in a battle for the soul of the nation — a battle for the wealth of the average American, the sovereignty of our borders, abuses by unelected bureaucrats in Washington and a president who is failing to uphold his constitutional duties to carry out the laws of this country.

Biden’s presidency has been a failure to date. We will see if he can come to the middle and work with a Republican controlled House of Representatives.

https://www.prweek.com/article/1805133/roche-diagnostics-brings-johnny-smith-lead-comms-strategy,Roche Diagnostics brings on Johnny Smith to lead comms strategy,"INDIANAPOLIS: Roche Diagnostics has hired Johnny Smith as VP of communications.

Smith, who has two decades of experience working in communications for healthcare systems, joined Roche Diagnostics in October. The U.S. headquarters of the Swiss company, which produces diagnostic equipment for cancer, cardiac health and infectious diseases, among other sectors, are in Smith’s hometown of Indianapolis.

“This presented a great opportunity to reunite with family back in Indianapolis but also tackle a new side of healthcare, more on the diagnostic side,” Smith said. “This gives me the opportunity to really zero in on diagnostics solutions and the role that diagnostics plays in the overall patient-care journey. So I’m really looking forward to joining a very established, incredible and amazing organization.”

Smith will manage public relations, media relations, internal communications, community engagement, creative services and digital communications, according to a biography from the American Lung Association, where Smith serves on the board.

He will oversee Roche’s communications strategy and execution, reporting to Matt Sause, president and CEO of Roche Diagnostics, North America.

Smith previously worked as VP of marketing services for Encompass Health, which operates rehabilitation hospitals, and as national senior director of marketing and communications for Ascension, the largest nonprofit health system in the U.S. He was also a member of PRWeek’s 2018 40 Under 40 class.

When asked which campaigns or products he would work on, Smith said he was still on a listening tour.

“I have had a deep, deep rich background on the healthcare provider side,” Smith said. “Now I just get the opportunity to lean in from a diagnostic standpoint and learn much more about how we support our laboratories, how we support healthcare providers and how we support patients across the country.”",['Eric Berger'],

This situation is especially acute in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where diagnostics plays a critical role for treating and containing the spread of infectious diseases such as Tuberculosis (TB) and HIV

New partnership between Roche and the Global Fund supports low- and middle-income countries in broadening access to diagnostics, helping millions of previously undiagnosed people with TB and HIV get diagnosed and eventually treated





Basel, 12 May 2022 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), through its Global Access Program, and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria are joining forces to build and strengthen diagnostic capacity and pandemic preparedness in low-and middle-income countries fighting against HIV and tuberculosis (TB).

About 2 billion people worldwide are estimated to be infected with tuberculosis, with 95% of TB deaths occurring in LMICs. Of more than 37 Million people living with HIV globally, over 6 Million people are undiagnosed. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many HIV and TB programs, resulting in HIV testing rates falling by 22% and an estimated additional 100 000 deaths from tuberculosis in LMICs in 2020.1,2

Roche and the Global Fund have joined forces to improve the diagnosis of HIV and TB in LMICs by building local capacity to tackle fundamental infrastructure challenges for generating and delivering diagnostic results and managing healthcare waste.

This includes building effective processes to collect, transport, test samples and return the results to patients for timely clinical interventions, as well as addressing challenges arising from a lack of network infrastructure, workforce capacity, access to roads, and IT systems. The partnership will also include novel approaches to reduce the environmental and economic burden of healthcare waste generated during the testing process itself and the disposal of instruments and medical devices at the end of its/their useful life.

“Roche is excited to join forces with the Global Fund and their partners to support countries in developing critical diagnostic networks in the global fight against HIV and TB.”, said Thomas Schinecker, CEO of Roche Diagnostics."" Connecting our experts with critical local stakeholders, we are aiming to help build sustainable solutions that could be scaled across countries.""

“Getting people to test for HIV and TB is fundamental to containing transmission and enrolling people on treatment, which are crucial steps to saving lives and ending these diseases as public health threats,” said Peter Sands, Executive Director of the Global Fund. “We are pleased to partner with Roche in expanding access to diagnostics tools for HIV and TB. These efforts will strengthen the fight against these diseases and help the world prepare better for future pandemics.”

Through collaboration with the Global Fund, Ministries of Health and country-based partners, Roche will first support assessments and implementation of new technologies and knowledge transfer in 2 to 3 pilot countries, with the ambition to scale up and expand support in 10 countries over the next five years.

About the Global Access Program

In 2014, Roche first launched its Global Access Program to support the UNAIDS 2020 targets to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Since then, the program was expanded to include solutions for other high-burden diseases such as Tuberculosis (TB), Hepatitis B and C (HBV and HCV), and Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Most recently, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 test was included into the program. The program is designed to support end-to-end, sustainable, local solutions that build capacity and strengthen healthcare systems, with a focus on diagnostics and laboratory networks.

The continual expansion of offerings highlights Roche's commitment to eliminate high burden infectious diseases for patients living in resource-constrained settings with limited access.

Any laboratory that implements a Roche instrument system gains the ability to scale up testing across multiple disease areas, thus increasing efficiency with respect to limited resources or time. An integrated approach supports national programs focused on increasing access to diagnostic testing, to help manage or reduce the impact of preventable disease for patients.

‒ Real-world studies of Vabysmo demonstrate ability to extend treatment intervals in the first four months while maintaining visual acuity –

‒ Clinical data on an investigational anti-interleukin-6 treatment in uveitic macular edema (UME) will be presented for the first time –

Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), announced today that new data for its approved and investigational medicines will be highlighted in 30 abstracts at the 2023 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Annual Meeting, which will be held from April 23-27 in New Orleans, LA. The abstracts showcase the strength of Genentech’s Ophthalmology portfolio, including post-hoc data from Phase III Vabysmo® (faricimab-svoa) studies that support its benefit in drying retinal fluid in wet, or neovascular, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME). Real-world data on Vabysmo treatment patterns and outcomes will also be presented, as well as approaches to personalized healthcare that include the use of artificial intelligence (AI) modeling to predict retinal disease progression. Additionally, Phase I data for an investigational anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) treatment in uveitic macular edema (UME), to be presented for the first time, suggest the monoclonal antibody may improve visual acuity in patients with UME.

“The breadth of data we are presenting at ARVO demonstrates our sustained commitment to preserving vision for people with potentially blinding retinal conditions,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “We are particularly encouraged by data indicating that Vabysmo may stabilize blood vessels and reduce fluid in the retina. Fluid control is essential for optimal central vision used for everyday activities such as reading and driving.”

The following data will be presented at ARVO 2023:

Vabysmo improves drying for people with wet AMD and DME

A post-hoc analysis from the head-to-head dosing period of the Phase III TENAYA and LUCERNE studies suggests Vabysmo results in greater drying of retinal fluid compared to aflibercept in people with wet AMD. The data include change in central subfield thickness (CST), absence of subretinal and intraretinal fluid (SRF and IRF) and time to absence of SRF and IRF.

A post-hoc analysis from the head-to-head dosing period of the Phase III YOSEMITE and RHINE studies also supports the positive impact of Vabysmo on macular blood vessel leakage compared to aflibercept in people with DME. Outcomes include macular leakage area and the proportion of patients with minimal to no macular leakage - two important markers of vascular stability. Another analysis from YOSEMITE and RHINE suggests Vabysmo reduces retinal fluid when compared to aflibercept in people with DME. The data include time to absence of DME (CST <325 µm) and time to absence of IRF.

Vabysmo extends dosing intervals early in the real-world

Two Vabysmo real-world studies in wet AMD and DME show patients extended their dosing intervals early in their treatment while maintaining or improving their vision. The majority of patients were able to extend their treatment intervals during the four initial doses. Treatment intervals were categorized as “extended” if any interval was more than six weeks apart.

Investigational IL-6 monoclonal antibody may benefit people with UME

Phase I data on an IL-6 inhibitor that is in development for UME and other retinal conditions suggest that this investigational monoclonal antibody improves visual acuity and CST in patients with UME.

The IL-6 pathway plays an important role in the development and progression of UME by promoting blood vessel leakage and inflammation. UME is a complication of uveitis, a form of eye inflammation. This results in accumulation of fluid in the macula and can lead to significant visual impairment and vision loss. About 750,000 patients have uveitis in the U.S. and approximately one-third are impacted by UME.

Genentech recently launched two Phase III trials in UME based on encouraging Phase I safety and efficacy data. The first patients have been treated in the Meerkat (NCT05642312) and Sandcat (NCT05642325) studies, which are evaluating the safety and efficacy of the monoclonal antibody in people with UME. Genentech is also studying the IL-6 inhibitor in DME.

AI and machine learning in retina

Genentech will also present research related to the diagnosis and treatment of retinal conditions. These presentations include new research on the use of AI and machine learning to predict disease progression in geographic atrophy, a progressive and irreversible form of AMD; enable timely and accurate assessment of disease activity in wet AMD or DME; predict treatment response in DME; and investigate new imaging biomarkers in diabetic retinopathy.

About Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that affects the macula, the part of the eye that provides sharp, central vision needed for activities like reading, and is a leading cause of blindness for people aged 60 and over in the U.S. Wet, or neovascular, AMD is an advanced form of the disease that can cause rapid and severe vision loss. Approximately 20 million people in the U.S. have some form of AMD, and of those, about 1.5 million have late-stage AMD which includes wet AMD.

Wet AMD is caused by growth of abnormal blood vessels, also referred to as choroidal neovascularization (CNV), into the macula. These vessels leak fluid and blood and cause scar tissue that destroys the central retina. This process results in a deterioration of sight over a period of months to years.

About Diabetic Macular Edema

Affecting approximately 750,000 people in the U.S., diabetic macular edema (DME) is a vision-threatening retinal condition associated with blindness and decreased quality of life when left untreated. DME occurs when damaged blood vessels in the retina leak into and cause swelling in the macula – the central area of the retina responsible for the sharp vision needed for reading and driving. The number of people with DME is expected to grow as the prevalence of diabetes increases.

Genentech has a robust Phase III clinical development program for Vabysmo. The program includes AVONELLE-X, an extension study of TENAYA and LUCERNE evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of Vabysmo in wet, or neovascular, macular degeneration (AMD), and RHONE-X, an extension study of YOSEMITE and RHINE evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of Vabysmo in diabetic macular edema (DME). In addition, Genentech is investigating the efficacy and safety of Vabysmo in people with macular edema following retinal vein occlusion in two Phase III studies, BALATON and COMINO.Genentech has also initiated several Phase IV studies, including the Elevatum study of Vabysmo in underrepresented patient populations with DME, the SALWEEN study of Vabysmo in a subpopulation of wet AMD highly prevalent in Asia, as well as the VOYAGER study, a global real-world data collection platform. Genentech also supports several other independent studies to further understand retinal conditions with a high unmet need.

About Vabysmo® (faricimab-svoa)

Vabysmo (faricimab-svoa) is the first bispecific antibody approved for the eye. It targets and inhibits two disease pathways linked to a number of vision-threatening retinal conditions by neutralizing angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). While research is underway to better understand the role of the Ang-2 pathway in retinal disease, Ang-2 and VEGF-A are thought to contribute to vision loss by destabilizing blood vessels, which may cause new leaky blood vessels to form and increase inflammation. By blocking pathways involving Ang-2 and VEGF-A, Vabysmo is designed to stabilize blood vessels.

Vabysmo U.S. Indications

Vabysmo (faricimab-svoa) is a prescription medicine given by injection into the eye, used to treat adults with neovascular (wet) age‑related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME).

Important Safety Information

Contraindications

Vabysmo is contraindicated in patients who have an infection in or around their eye, have active swelling around their eye that may include pain and redness, or are allergic to Vabysmo or any of the ingredients in Vabysmo.

Warnings and Precautions

Injections like the one for Vabysmo can cause an eye infection (endophthalmitis) or separation of layers of the retina (retinal detachment). Patients should seek medical care if they experience increasing eye pain, vision loss, sensitivity to light, or redness in the white of the eye.

Vabysmo may cause a temporary increase in pressure in the eye (intraocular pressure), which occurs 60 minutes after the injection.

Although not common, Vabysmo patients have had serious, sometimes fatal, problems related to blood clots, such as heart attacks or strokes (thromboembolic events). In clinical studies for wet AMD during the first year, 7 out of 664 patients treated with Vabysmo reported such an event. In DME studies from baseline to week 100, 64 out of 1,262 patients treated with Vabysmo reported such an event.

Adverse Reactions

The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving Vabysmo were cataract (15%) and blood on the white of the eye (conjunctival hemorrhage, 7%). These are not all the possible side effects of Vabysmo.

Pregnancy, Lactation, Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Based on how Vabysmo interacts with your body, there may be a potential risk to an unborn baby. Patients should use birth control before their first injection, during their treatment with Vabysmo, and for 3 months after their last dose of Vabysmo.

It is not known if Vabysmo passes into breast milk. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider about the best way to feed their baby if they receive Vabysmo.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15874-4,Reliability and validity of the Roche PD Mobile Application for remote monitoring of early Parkinson’s disease,"Reliability and validity of the Roche PD Mobile Application v2

The Roche PD Mobile Application v1 was designed to measure the core motor signs of PD5,18, and was recently revised to v2 to primarily include two new active tests of bradykinesia (Hand Turning, Draw A Shape), as well as a test of psychomotor slowing (eSDMT) and a speech test. In addition, the original gait task was revised to a U-turn test, and a smartwatch was incorporated into the remote passive monitoring procedure. Preliminary test–retest reliability scores for the pre-specified sensor features from all active tests except Speech and eSDMT, and for both passive monitoring measures, were in the ‘excellent’ range22. Preliminary clinical validity was established via correlations with corresponding MDS-UPDRS item scores. We note that these findings are reassuring considering the continuous (sensor feature) versus ordinal (MDS-UPDRS) nature of the two datasets, and the lack of conceptually comparable MDS-UPDRS items for some active test features (e.g. Draw A Shape). Cross-correlations between sensor features and MDS-UPDRS subscale scores supported the convergent and divergent validity of bradykinesia and tremor sensor features. Most active test sensor features demonstrated sensitivity for subtle manifestations, discriminating individuals who received MDS-UPDRS item scores of 0 from those with item scores of 1. Measures of upper limb bradykinesia demonstrated known-groups validity, differentiating individuals in Hoehn and Yahr Stage I versus II. All lateralized sensor features discriminated least versus the most affected sides of the body. The results from shared active tests and passive sensor features confirm previous findings with the Roche PD Mobile Application v15. Taken together, these results indicate that the Roche PD Mobile Application v2 may prove suitable for quantifying motor disease severity and tracking disease progression in the earlier stages of PD.

DHT measurement of bradykinesia

The Roche PD Mobile Application v2 contains three active tests designed to measure upper limb bradykinesia: Dexterity (finger tapping), Hand Turning (pronation/supination), and Draw A Shape. Pre-specified sensor features from all three tests correlated with their corresponding MDS-UPDRS upper limb bradykinesia item scores, and showed convergent and divergent validity in cross-correlations with MDS-UPDRS Part III subscale scores, correlating numerically most strongly with bradykinesia compared with all other subscale scores. These findings indicate that the Roche PD Mobile Application v2 bradykinesia tests indeed reflect the neurological concept of upper limb bradykinesia. Finger tapping and pronation/supination tasks are well-established assessments of upper limb bradykinesia as evidenced by their inclusion in both the UPDRS24 and MDS-UPDRS8. Over the last decade, different digitized variants of finger tapping and pronation/supination tests have been developed21. Despite methodological differences, studies of these DHT tasks generally showed good correspondence between finger tapping sensor features and respective clinical ratings, as well as the ability to differentiate healthy controls from individuals with early PD, and individuals with early PD from individuals with later-stage PD5,18,25,26,27,28, in line with the present findings. While the literature on digitized pronation/supination assessments is less rich than for finger tapping, available results also consistently demonstrate correlations with related clinical scores and the ability to differentiate healthy participants from individuals with PD16,23,29,30,31. Spiral drawing is traditionally used in behavioral neurology to assess fine motor impairment including bradykinesia and tremor32,33,34,35. DHT versions of spiral drawing demonstrated that time to completion correlated with clinician ratings of bradykinesia severity, and differentiated PD cases from controls34. The majority of previous DHT spiral drawing tasks used pens/digital pens to draw on regular paper or tablets, a more challenging motor task compared with the present finger drawing on smaller smartphone touch screens. In the present study, celerity, i.e. accuracy/time to complete spiral shape tracing on the smartphone screen, was pre-specified to additionally consider the accuracy of directed fine motor movements in the unsupervised at-home setting. Spiral celerity correlated with MDS-UPDRS bradykinesia measures, and the strength of these correlations was numerically smaller compared with Finger Tapping and Hand Turning. This may be due to the relative difficulty of the latter two tasks compared with spiral drawing, which may have challenged individuals more, thereby revealing greater impairment. We note that additional sensor features (e.g. variability in drawing speed, hesitation), analyzed either individually or combined within and across shapes, are expected to provide additional meaningful information, as has been shown for PD and multiple sclerosis36,37.

Passive monitoring with smartwatches

Passive monitoring with smartwatches provides a unique opportunity to explore slowing of upper limb movements during daily life. Here, sensor data segments during arm movements were identified from the circa 90% non-walking periods in the passive monitoring sensor data stream, using the squared magnitude of the accelerometer sensor movement as the sensor feature. This same feature has been related to decreased expressivity in patients with schizophrenia with negative symptoms38. Here, arm movement power was specifically related to the MDS-UPDRS bradykinesia subscore and item scores, as well as the rigidity subscore, and is in line with a slowing of hand movement in daily non-gait-related activities such as gesturing when speaking, eating, etc. These findings are consistent with previous research with wrist-worn wearables, which traditionally focused on arm swing during gait39,40,41, as well as multi-sensor systems used to measure the impact of bradykinesia on activities of daily living15,42. Thus, passively monitored motor behavior in daily life may facilitate our understanding of the effect and burden of PD on individuals’ daily lives.

DHT measurement of bradyphrenia

The eSDMT43 is commonly applied to measure psychomotor slowing, or bradyphrenia, one of the earliest cognitive signs in PD, appearing up to 5 years prior to a PD dementia diagnosis20. However, as the test requires multiple cognitive functions, it is not surprising that it is sensitive to many forms of neurologic impairment44. Indeed, while SDMT performance is reduced in PD45, impairments are exacerbated in individuals with PD with concomitant vascular46 and amyloid47 imaging findings. A standard SDMT outcome measure, number of correct responses in 90 s, was pre-specified for the present analyses of the eSDMT, and showed ‘good’22 test–retest reliability (ICC = 0.75). However, it correlated only weakly (rho = −0.18) with the MDS-UPDRS item 1.1. assessing global cognitive impairment. This finding is surprising given the catch-all nature of both the eSDMT and MDS-UPDRS item 1.1., but may be accounted for by the fact that cognitive impairments were excluded during the screening process in the PASADENA study, leading to a truncation of range in both scores (see Supplementary Fig. 1). We note that we attempted to minimize the effect of bradykinesia on eSDMT scores by requiring a simple tap response on a number pad displayed at the bottom half of the smartphone screen. Nevertheless, to mitigate the risk of this confound, eSDMT performance could be controlled by a non-cognitively demanding motor test using a similar response format.

DHT measurement of voice and speech

Voice and speech impairments in PD are varied and generally summarized under the term dysarthria, and include resonatory, articulatory, phonatory, prosodic and respiratory components48. This symptomatology and its relevance to patients’ daily lives motivated the inclusion of a Sustained Phonation task in the suite of active tests, and the development of the novel Speech test. Voice jitter was pre-selected as a proxy of disordered vocal fold function for the sustained phonation test. In line with previous research49, increased voice jitter correlated weakly with MDS-UPDRS 3.1. (Speech) scores, and differentiated individuals with slight speech disturbances (MDS-UPDRS 3.1. score of 1) from those with no perceivable speech impairment at the site visit (MDS-UPDRS 3.1. score of 0). In the Speech active test, monotonicity (i.e. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient 2 [MFCC] 2 fundamental frequency variability) was selected as the sensor feature of prosodic deficits based on previous research demonstrating that this feature differentiated individuals with PD from healthy controls48. In the present study, MFCC2 variability correlated with MDS-UPDRS 3.1. (Speech) scores, and differentiated participants with MDS-UPDRS 3.1. scores of 0 and 1. The bulbar MDS-UPDRS Part III composite item score was designed to gauge the severity of motor impairments in body parts involved in speech production. Despite a truncation of range in this score (average < 3/20 points), MFCC2 variability correlated with the bulbar score, indicating that this feature may estimate the severity of motor impairments in the speech apparatus. Future research will investigate further richly multi-faceted aspects of speech function to better understand motor and cognitive behavior in PD.

DHT measurement of tremor, turning and balance

The Roche PD Mobile Application v2 aims to assess the broad array of motor signs in PD and related movement disorders. Thus, besides bradykinesia, speech, voice, and psychomotor slowing, tremor (rest, postural), turning during gait, and balance were also assessed. The rest and postural tremor active test features corresponded most strongly to the respective MDS-UPDRS concepts of tremor, as demonstrated by the highest correlation overall with any MDS-UPDRS item and subscale scores. This is consistent with similar DHT reports5,25,50. The novel U-turn test (which instructed individuals, if safe to do so, to walk several paces and make a U-turn at least five times) and the identification of turning while walking throughout the day in passive monitoring sensor data, were motivated by findings that turning is particularly impaired in PD5,51,52. For example, a 360 degree walking turn and instrumented timed-up-and-go test showed strong reliability and discriminated controls from PD participants53,54. Similarly, sensor-based measures of turn speed in daily life differentiated PD individuals from controls55. In the present study, turn speed measured in both the active test and passive setting correlated with MDS-UPDRS 3.14. body bradykinesia item scores, but was not specifically related to MDS-UPDRS PIGD relative to other subscores. While neither measure of turn speed differentiated between less and more affected individuals on MDS-UPDRS body bradykinesia scores of 0 versus 1, both differentiated between individuals in Hoehn and Yahr Stage I versus II. Although participants were not instructed to ‘turn as fast as possible’ to ensure a safe conduct of the active test, the U-turn test showed numerically higher correlations with body bradykinesia compared with passive turning speed, in line with similar profile of performance (active testing) versus capacity (passive monitoring) scores previously demonstrated for gait speed56. In the balance active test, the jerk sensor feature correlated with the MDS-UPDRS 3.12. postural stability item score, similar to previous reports5,57, and differentiated individuals with MDS-UPDRS item 3.12 scores of 0 versus 1, but failed to differentiate individuals in Hoehn and Yahr Stage I versus II. We speculate that this negative finding may reflect the low levels of gait and postural instability impairments in the present cohort (mean PIGD = 1).

DHT composite scores

A composite summary score of individual features across diverse assessments is expected to provide a more robust measure of global PD severity and progression, especially given the heterogeneous nature of PD. Several DHT solutions besides the Roche PD Mobile Application v2 administer different motor active tests, and some additionally collect passive monitoring data5,17,18. Supplementary Table 2 provides a high-level comparison of these DHT solutions. All solutions contain active tests for tremor and tapping, but vary with respect to the inclusion of other upper limb, postural stability/gait, cognition, and voice/speech tests, and whether passively monitored motor data are collected. The power of combining different features across the tests in these DHTs has been shown via machine learning models that predict MDS-UPDRS total scores (Roche PD Mobile Application v1)58 or lead to a new score based on differentiation of ON and OFF L-dopa states59, and distinguished between healthy controls, idiopathic Rapid Eye Movement and PD16,60. A machine learning approach was also used to combine different HopkinsPD baseline sensor features to predict clinically significant events (e.g. falls, functional impairment) at the 18-month follow-up61. In contrast to data-driven approaches to composite score development, a clinical outcomes assessment approach could be applied whereby information from individuals with PD informs the selection of sensor features such that they optimally reflect what matters most to patients62.

Limitations

Several facets of the present study limit the generalizability of the findings. Firstly, all individuals’ disease duration was < 2 years, and individuals were in Hoehn and Yahr Stages I or II. Thus, the applicability of the present findings to later-stage or prodromal PD is unknown. The reduced range of disease severities also appeared to limit the ranges of some DHT and clinical measures, which consequently limited the possibility to detect relationships between the two (Supplementary Fig. 1). Also, further research is necessary to better understand the suitability of this remote monitoring approach for later-stage patients with more severe cognitive or visual impairments. Second, since Roche PD Mobile Application v2 data are not yet available from neurologically normal individuals, sensor feature cut-off values differentiating normal from impaired motor behavior could not yet be calculated. It should be also noted that comparisons between DHT measures and clinical measures such as the MDS-UPDRS can also be affected by limitations in the clinical measures; if an active test is not adequately reflected by a clinical measure, the ability to detect meaningful correlations is reduced. Finally, only two continuous 2-week periods of DHT data were analyzed; thus, the long-term adherence to the remote monitoring procedure and ability of sensor features to detect changes over time remain to be established. Towards this end, it is critical to quantify and report test–retest reliabilities of sensor feature scores towards assessing a sensor feature’s potential to detect changes over time63 and any deviation from normal progression as a function of e.g. pharmacological interventions.

The Roche PD Mobile Application v2 was designed to measure the severity of early PD core motor signs and to provide information complementary to established clinical outcome measures. This remote monitoring approach enables high-frequency (i.e. daily) assessments with low average daily burden. The frequent measurement coupled with the high sensitivity of smartphone/smartwatch sensors may increase signal-to-noise of digital outcome measures for clinical research and provide novel insights into patients’ functioning in daily life.","['Lipsmeier', 'Roche Pharma Research', 'Early Development', 'Pred Informatics', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Neuroscience', 'Rare Diseases Discovery', 'Translational Area', 'Roche Innovation Center Basel']",

https://www.roche.com/stories/following-the-fibroblasts/,Pushing the boundaries of science: Following the Fibroblasts,"By thinking differently, we can one day complement existing therapies for a wide range of diseases for patients. An exciting collaboration significantly advances the understanding of how tissue cells contribute to immune responses in multiple diseases.

Over the past several decades, scientists have built a detailed catalogue of the many and varied immune cells in our body, and the parts they play in maintaining health and driving disease. Based on this knowledge, new therapies for diseases where the immune system is involved, ranging from autoimmune disease to fibrosis and cancer, target the immune system. Yet while these medicines work well for some patients, for others they don’t make a positive difference, or their bodies develop resistance to the therapies over time. One potential reason for this critical medical gap is the relatively poor scientific understanding of cells, known as fibroblasts, that make up the support and connective structures of tissues, and how they behave in disease. Unlike immune cells, a full catalogue of the many flavours of fibroblasts, including tissue-specific and shared subtypes, has been missing.

""We have to think differently for patients to get the tissue back to normal function."" Kara Lassen Head of Immunology Discovery

Without that knowledge, it is unclear whether there are similarities among fibroblasts in different tissues and disease contexts, or whether fibroblasts are bystanders or active players in diseases. And that, in turn, makes it impossible to develop new therapies targeting rogue fibroblasts. As Andreas Frei, Head of Biomarkers and Translational Technologies for Immunology at Roche, noted, “We need to understand the cell types before we can understand the interactions between them.” Five years ago, with this goal in mind, interested scientists in Roche Pharma Research and Early Development convened a consortium of top researchers in the field across academic centres and within Roche. Now, their research is coming to fruition: they have identified similar fibroblasts across several diseases in different organs, and are beginning to describe the fibroblast landscape of individual disorders as well. In a research article published recently in the scientific journal Med, the research network studied the fibroblasts from patients with four diseases: Sjögren’s syndrome, interstitial lung disease, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. They used new techniques that allowed them to determine the gene expression patterns of individual fibroblast cells, which they could then use to classify the cells into different types and across the different tissues studied.

In addition, patients treated with Vabysmo received up to 33% fewer median number of injections compared to aflibercept

Reducing the number of eye injections over time could offer a less burdensome treatment schedule for individuals, their caregivers and healthcare systems

Vabysmo simultaneously targets and inhibits two disease pathways involving Ang-2 and VEGF-A linked to a number of vision-threatening retinal conditions

Basel, 19 September 2022 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the European Commission (EC) approved Vabysmo® (faricimab) for the treatment of neovascular or ‘wet’ age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema (DME). These retinal conditions are two of the leading causes of vision loss worldwide, affecting more than 40 million people 1,2,3,4

“Many people with nAMD and DME struggle to keep up with the monthly eye injections and physician visits, often associated with current standards of care, and unfortunately their vision may suffer as a result of undertreatment,” said Prof Ramin Tadayoni, head of the ophthalmology department, Lariboisière, Saint-Louis and Rothschild Hospitals, Paris, France, and European Society of Retina Specialists (EURETINA) president elect. “For people in Europe living with these conditions, today’s approval offers the first new mechanism of action in over a decade; one which could improve and protect their vision with fewer injections over time.”

Vabysmo is the only injectable eye medicine approved in Europe with phase III studies supporting treatment at intervals of up to four months for people living with nAMD and DME.5,6,7 With the potential to require fewer eye injections over time, while also improving and maintaining vision and anatomy, Vabysmo could offer a less burdensome treatment schedule for individuals, their caregivers and healthcare systems 6,7,8,9

“The approval of Vabysmo in Europe is the result of years of pioneering research from Roche ophthalmologists and scientists, who are deeply committed to improving outcomes for people with retinal conditions,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., PhD., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are delighted to offer people in Europe this first-of-its-kind treatment option and are working to bring Vabysmo to people with nAMD and DME as soon as possible.”

Today’s approval is based on results across four phase III studies in two indications, involving 3,220 patients: TENAYA and LUCERNE in nAMD at year one, and YOSEMITE and RHINE in DME up to two years. The studies showed that people treated with Vabysmo, given at intervals of up to four months, achieved similar vision gains and anatomical improvements compared to aflibercept given every two months.6,7,8 The totality of data across all four studies at two years showed that more than 60% of people treated with Vabysmo were able to extend treatment to every four months, while improving and maintaining vision. Additionally, up to two years, people with nAMD and DME treated with Vabysmo received 33% (10 vs. 15) and 21% (11 vs. 14) fewer median number of injections compared to aflibercept, respectively.6,9

Vabysmo, a bispecific antibody, is uniquely engineered to target and inhibit two disease pathways, linked to a number of vision-threatening retinal conditions, by neutralising angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), to restore vascular stability. By independently blocking both pathways involving Ang-2 and VEGF-A, Vabysmo is designed to stabilise blood vessels and thereby reduce inflammation, leakage and abnormal vessel growth (neovascularisation) more than inhibition of VEGF-A alone.7 This sustained blood vessel stabilisation may improve disease control, vision and anatomical outcomes for longer.7,8

Vabysmo is now approved in the European Union and nine other countries around the world, including the US, Japan, and the UK, for people living with nAMD and DME, and submissions to other regulatory authorities are ongoing.5,10,11,12 Globally, more than 100,000 Vabysmo doses have been distributed for treatment of these conditions to date.13 Roche also continues to explore areas where Vabysmo has the potential to deliver additional benefits to patients, including retinal vein occlusion.

About the Vabysmo® (faricimab) clinical development programme

Roche has a robust phase III clinical development programme for Vabysmo. The programme includes AVONELLE-X, an extension study of TENAYA and LUCERNE, evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of Vabysmo in neovascular or ‘wet’ age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), and RHONE-X, an extension study of YOSEMITE and RHINE, evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of Vabysmo in diabetic macular edema (DME).14,15 Additionally, the BALATON and COMINO trials are underway, evaluating the efficacy and safety of Vabysmo in people with macular edema following retinal vein occlusion.16,17 Roche has also initiated the phase IV ELEVATUM study of Vabysmo in underrepresented patient populations with DME.18

About the TENAYA and LUCERNE studies7,9

TENAYA ( NCT03823287 ) and LUCERNE ( NCT03823300 ) were two identical, randomised, multicentre, double-masked, global phase III studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of Vabysmo® (faricimab) compared to aflibercept in 1,329 people living with neovascular or ‘wet’ age-related macular degeneration (671 in TENAYA and 658 in LUCERNE).

Both studies met their primary endpoint, with Vabysmo given at intervals of up to every four months consistently shown to offer visual acuity gains and anatomical improvements that were non-inferior to aflibercept given every two months. A secondary endpoint in both studies measured the proportion of people in the Vabysmo arm that were treated on dosing schedules of every three or four months during the first year. Importantly, 46% (n=144/315) of those receiving Vabysmo in TENAYA and 45% (n=142/316) in LUCERNE were able to be treated every four months in the first year, and an additional 34% (n=107/315) and 33% (n=104/316), respectively, were able to be treated every three months. Combined, nearly 80% of people receiving Vabysmo were able to go three months or longer between treatments during the first year.

At two years, vision improvements were comparable across both treatment arms. In TENAYA, the average vision gains from baseline at two years were +3.7 eye chart letters in the Vabysmo arm and +3.3 letters in the aflibercept arm. In LUCERNE, the average vision gains from baseline at two years were +5.0 letters in the Vabysmo arm and +5.2 letters in the aflibercept arm. Furthermore, 59% (n=160/271) of Vabysmo patients in TENAYA and 67% (n=192/287) in LUCERNE achieved four-month dosing at two years. This is an increase over one-year results, which showed 46% (n=144/315) of Vabysmo patients in TENAYA and 45% (n=142/316) in LUCERNE achieved four-month dosing. An additional 15% (n=41/271) of Vabysmo patients in TENAYA and 14% (n=41/287) in LUCERNE achieved three-month dosing at two years. Combined, approximately 80% of Vabysmo patients were able to go three months or longer between treatments at the end of the second year.

Vabysmo was generally well tolerated in both studies, with a favourable benefit-risk profile. In TENAYA and LUCERNE, the most common adverse reactions (≥3% of people) included cataract, conjunctival haemorrhage, vitreous floaters, retinal pigment epithelial tears, increase of intraocular pressure and eye pain. Safety results were consistent across study arms.

Two-year data from TENAYA and LUCERNE were presented at the 2022 American Society of Retina Specialists Annual Scientific Meeting. These data will be submitted to the European Medicines Agency in due course.



About the YOSEMITE and RHINE studies6,8

YOSEMITE ( NCT03622580 ) and RHINE ( NCT03622593 ) were two identical, randomised, multicentre, double-masked, global phase III studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of Vabysmo® (faricimab) compared to aflibercept in 1,891 people with visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema (940 in YOSEMITE and 951 in RHINE).

Both studies met their primary endpoint, with Vabysmo given at intervals of up to every four months consistently shown to offer visual acuity gains and anatomical improvements that were non-inferior to aflibercept given every two months. A secondary endpoint in both studies measured the proportion of people in the Vabysmo treat-and-extend arm that achieved dosing schedules of every three or four months. Importantly, 53% (n=151/286) of those in the Vabysmo treat-and-extend arm in YOSEMITE and 51% (n=157/308) in RHINE achieved four-month dosing at the end of the first year, and an additional 21% (n=60/286) and 20% (n=63/308), respectively, achieved three-month dosing. At two years, the number of people in the Vabysmo treat-and-extend arm achieving four-month dosing increased to 60% (n=162/270) in YOSEMITE and 64% (n=185/287) in RHINE. An additional 18% (n=49/270) of people in YOSEMITE and 14% (n=39/287) in RHINE achieved three-month dosing. Combined, almost 80% of people in the Vabysmo treat-and-extend arm were able to go three months or longer between treatments at the end of the second year.

Vabysmo was generally well tolerated in both studies, with a favourable benefit-risk profile. In YOSEMITE and RHINE, the most common adverse reactions (≥3% of people) included cataract, conjunctival haemorrhage, vitreous floaters, increase of intraocular pressure and eye pain. Safety results were consistent across study arms.

About neovascular age-related macular degeneration

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that affects the part of the eye that provides sharp, central vision needed for activities like reading.1,19 Neovascular or ‘wet’ AMD (nAMD) is an advanced form of the disease that can cause rapid and severe vision loss if left untreated.20,21 It develops when new and abnormal blood vessels grow uncontrolled under the macula, causing swelling, bleeding and/or fibrosis.21 Worldwide, around 20 million people are living with nAMD – the leading cause of vision loss in people over the age of 60 – and the condition will affect even more people around the world as the global population ages.1,2,22

About diabetic macular edema

Affecting around 21 million people globally, diabetic macular edema (DME) is a vision-threatening retinal condition associated with blindness and decreased quality of life when left untreated.3,23 DME occurs when damaged blood vessels leak into and cause swelling in the macula – the central area of the retina responsible for the sharp vision needed for reading and driving.19,24 The number of people with DME is expected to grow as the prevalence of diabetes increases.25

About Vabysmo® (faricimab)8

Vabysmo is the first bispecific antibody approved for the eye. It targets and inhibits two disease pathways linked to a number of vision-threatening retinal conditions, by neutralising angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). Ang-2 and VEGF-A contribute to vision loss by destabilising blood vessels, causing new leaky blood vessels to form and increasing inflammation. By blocking pathways involving Ang-2 and VEGF-A, Vabysmo is designed to stabilise blood vessels.

Although he is now an industry veteran, his journey into the pharma industry has been far from linear. Here, he shares how he found his first regulatory role in industry, his proudest achievements, and his thoughts on the trends set to take the sector by storm.

How did you first get involved with pharma?



I didn’t plan to pursue a career in pharma. I actually wanted to be a researcher. I studied pharmacy at a university in France and had my sights set on a completely different professional path – but I stumbled across an opportunity to work at a French medicines regulatory agency and ended up working there for 13 years, even though it was nothing I had ever intended to do! Nevertheless, it was an experience I thoroughly enjoyed.

Through the agency, I became involved in several committees – but a reshuffle within the organization prompted me to move on and see what was happening in the industry. Though I had worked closely with pharma companies, I had never had a role within one before. I ended up joining Roche and have been pretty happy with the nine years of experience I’ve amassed since then. It has taught me a lot about the inner workings of the pharma sector.

Why is the biopharmaceutical industry so inspiring to you?



Before joining pharma, I was concerned by what some might call the “dark side of the industry.” In other words, I was worried that companies would prioritize financial gain above all else. But I was surprised to find how patient-centric the industry was. When I joined Roche nine years ago, I wouldn’t have been able to imagine the number of conversations I have had about the future of patient care.

The attitude that I have encountered among my colleagues and peers has been incredibly inspiring. My current role also pushes me to think about the ways a given medicine could impact patient lives. It’s evident that a patient-first mindset permeates all aspects of the industry and helps drive progress in the field.

What have been your proudest achievements?



Around 2004, my team and I had a challenging time when it came to biosimilars. The European Commission wanted us to draft some guidance on their quality requirements, but we had a limited timeframe in which to do so. Despite the pressure, we managed to meet our deadline and the guidance was finally published in 2006. Many of the concepts outlined in the document are still used today on an international scale! It was a massive personal achievement and, in spite of the challenges, something I look back on with a sense of fondness.

I’ve also had the pleasure of working with the WHO. In fact, working alongside the organization has been one of the most gratifying and rewarding experiences of my professional life. The WHO’s efforts to support patients in need – wherever they might be – really bring you back to earth. The opportunity I’ve had to collaborate with them has reminded me that some of the challenges I often face within the pharmaceutical sphere are luxuries for most people around the world, who, at the end of the day, are looking for the simplest, most cost-effective methods to treat the diseases they live with.

What industry trends are you focused on?



A lot of my work focuses on the evolution of regulatory frameworks across the world. Currently, ATMP field is rapidly growing; as a result, we’re seeing a lot of different guidance popping up. Although it’s positive that so many people are interested in these products, monitoring the legislation that is developed is quite complicated. With the number of texts that are now being published, we are now at risk of divergence in terms of requirements and fundamental expectations when it comes to the quality standards and the classification of these products.

If you could create a wishlist of policies, what would it include?



There are two key elements. One would be the harmonization of technical requirements for R&D. The other would be reliance between healthcare authorities.

With regard to harmonization, there are increasing discrepancies between some regions. For example, in the EU or US regions there is a wealth of technical guidances for product development that have been published but, when we look farther afield, many countries in the world are developing their own regulation and technical guidance that introduces differences in the way products are registered. If we could develop agreements that help align these regulatory frameworks, we would see a difference in the ways companies approach product development and registration. Some industry groups are working toward this type of harmonization, but although organizations like WHO and ICH are attempting to drive convergence in that field, the broad range of topics they have to address and the limited experience mean that this won’t happen quickly.

Beyond this, I would love to see greater collaboration between all the stakeholders, including regulators, academics and industries. If people shared their experiences and challenges, we could mutually learn from each other and build a better framework to enable patient access to innovative medicines.

On what pharmaceutical frontiers are you most excited to see progress?



Two of the biggest areas of innovation I’ve noticed in recent years are the technological evolution that has happened in the gene therapy space and the use of big data and artificial intelligence platforms. We’re seeing the convergence of these two things more than ever before. When you develop gene therapies using AI tools, you end up with therapies that are so advanced it’s difficult to catch up. It’s also a challenge to develop appropriate regulations for this kind of fast-paced therapy development where there is a need to find a proper balance to properly enable innovation without over-regulating the field.

But this is an incredibly interesting area for regulatory professionals to contend with. The future will undoubtedly have hurdles for us to address, but I’m incredibly excited by the prospect of making a difference in this area.","['Maryam Mahdi', 'Deputy Editor', 'After Finishing My Degree', 'I Envisioned A Career In Science Communications.

ZURICH/LONDON, June 16 (Reuters) - Roche's experimental Alzheimer's drug crenezumab failed to meaningfully slow or prevent cognitive decline in people at risk of a rare, inherited form of the disease, the Swiss drugmaker said on Thursday.

The failure marks another blow to the hypothesis that targeting toxic protein plaque known as beta amyloid in the brain is a viable approach to arresting the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

Roche had hoped to prove crenezumab, which is designed to block beta amyloid, could prevent the memory-robbing disease if given before symptoms emerged.

The lengthy study involved 252 people from an extended family in Columbia diagnosed with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) caused by a specific gene mutation. They were enrolled before they showed any signs.

Participants were randomised to receive regular infusions of crenezumab or placebo over five to eight years. On Thursday, Roche said that although small numerical differences favoured crenezumab, the effects were not statistically significant.

Roche's shares slipped more than 1% in afternoon trading.

Crenezumab was discovered by fellow Swiss drug developer AC Immune (ACIU.O), but Roche was in charge of its development via a licence agreement. The drug previously failed a pair of phase III studies evaluating its use in the early stages of Alzheimer's.

The field targeting the fatal brain disease - which affects an estimated 55 million globally - is littered with high profile failures. Drugs designed to target Alzheimer's have nearly always stumbled in trials.

Adoption of the first new Alzheimer's treatment in nearly 20 years, made by rival U.S. drugmaker Biogen Inc (BIIB.O), spectacularly underwhelmed after the U.S. health regulator gave the green light to the treatment without clear evidence of patient benefit, driven in part by the lack of options for the most common form of dementia.

Roche, which recently suffered a key cancer drug setback, has its own keenly-watched Alzheimer's prospect. Late-stage data on the drug, gantenerumab, is expected later this year.

But the company has sought to temper expectations around high-risk, high-reward product.

""Everyone knows Alzheimer's research is a very risky type of research,"" Chairman Christoph Franz told Reuters last month. read more

Demand for newly launched medicines to treat severe diseases, namely Hemlibra (haemophilia), Ocrevus (multiple sclerosis), Tecentriq (cancer), Evrysdi (spinal muscular atrophy) and Phesgo (cancer) drove the Swiss pharma giant’s performance for the year. While sales of these medicines all increased, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have some negative impact on Roche’s pharmaceutical sales, as did biosimilar competition for MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin, Avastin and Lucentis.However, the negative impact caused by the pandemic and biosimilar competition, was partially offset by medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 that ultimately contributed to sales growth, including Actemra/RoActemra for severe COVID-19 pneumonia, which received U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of hospitalized adults and children. In addition, Ronapreve, an investigational neutralizing antibody combination for high-risk COVID-19 patients, developed with Regeneron, has been made available to patients in more than 40 countries across many geographies and economies.In January 2021, the European Commission (EC) approved single-dose, oral Xofluza for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza in patients aged 12 years and above. The EC has also approved Xofluza for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in individuals aged 12 years and above. Xofluza, with its rapid reduction in viral replication, could help patients recover more quickly, while also reducing the societal burden of influenza. This marks the first innovation in mechanism of action for an influenza antiviral approved by the EC in almost 20 years.In March 2021, Roche’s Actemra/RoActemra became the first biologic therapy approved by the FDA for slowing the rate of decline in pulmonary function in adults with systemic sclerosis (SSc)-associated interstitial lung disease, a rare, debilitating condition that affects about 2.5 million people worldwide. Approximately 80% of SSc patients may be affected by interstitial lung disease (ILD), a progressive disease that can significantly impact lung function and can be life-threatening. In a global study, Actemra/RoActemra reduced the rate of progressive loss of lung function in people with SSc-ILD compared to placebo.In April 2021, Roche confirmed that the FDA had approved its supplemental Biologics License Application for Xolair (omalizumab) prefilled syringe for self-injection across all approved U.S. indications. Xolair is the only FDA-approved biologic designed to target and block immunoglobulin E (IgE) for the treatment of moderate to severe persistent allergic asthma, chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) and nasal polyps.In May 2021, Roche’s Tecentriq was approved by European Commission as a first-line monotherapy treatment for people with a type of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Tecentriq significantly improved overall survival in people with high PD-L1 expression, compared with chemotherapy in a Phase III study and the approval offers an alternative to chemotherapy for all eligible patients. This approval marks Tecentriq’s fourth indication in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and fifth indication in lung cancer overall in the EU.In other Tecetriq, news, in October 2021, the FDA approved the cancer drug as adjuvant treatment for certain people with early non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tecentriq is the first and only cancer immunotherapy approved for NSCLC in the adjuvant setting. Approval is based on the Phase III IMpower010 study showing adjuvant Tecentriq improved disease-free survival by more than one-third in PD-L1-positive Stage II-IIIA lung cancer, compared with best supportive care.In October 2021, the FDA also approved Roche’s Susvimo, a first-of-its-kind therapeutic approach for neovascular or “wet” age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Susvimo, previously called Port Delivery System with ranibizumab, is the first nAMD treatment in 15 years to provide an alternative to standard-of-care eye injections needed as often as once a month. By continuously delivering medicine into the eye through a refillable implant, Susvimo may help people with nAMD maintain their vision with as few as two treatments per year. Neovascular AMD impacts approximately 20 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of blindness in people over the age of 60.In July 2021, Roche entered a drug discovery deal with Mimetas, a provider of organ-on-chip-based disease models and technology. The collaboration will focus on developing human disease models to characterize novel compounds in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and hepatitis B virus infections (HBV). Mimetas is responsible for developing tissue-based disease models and assays in the OrganoPlate, its proprietary organ-on-chip platform that increases predictability of biomarkers and reduces animal use in scientific testing. Roche gains access to technology, disease models, and scientific results. Roche will also receive an option to exclusively license specific disease models and assays for use in drug discovery.In August 2021, Roche entered a collaboration with Shape Therapeutics, a biotechnology company developing RNA technologies for gene therapy. Through this partnership, ShapeTX will apply its proprietary RNA editing platform RNAfix and potentially leverage its AAVid technology platform for next-generation tissue-specific adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) for the development of gene therapy for certain targets in the areas of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and rare diseases. During the course of the partnership, ShapeTX will conduct preclinical research to identify and deliver development candidates discovered by its AI-powered platforms RNAfix and, potentially, AAVid. Roche will be responsible for the development and worldwide commercialization of any potential products resulting from the collaboration. In addition to an initial payment, ShapeTX could receive milestones worth more than $3 billion from the collaboration.In September 2021, Roche, through its biotech subsidiary Genentech, entered a collaboration with Adaptimmune Therapeutics to develop and commercialize allogeneic cell therapies to treat multiple oncology indications. The collaboration entails the development of allogeneic T-cell therapies for up to five shared cancer targets, and development of personalized allogeneic T-cell therapies. Adaptimmune is responsible for developing clinical candidates using its induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived allogeneic platform to produce T-cells (iT cells). Genentech will be responsible for the input TCRs and subsequent clinical development and commercialization. Adaptimmune received $150 million upfront and additional payments of $150 million over five years, unless the agreement is terminated earlier. Adaptimmune may also be eligible to receive milestones potentially exceeding $3 billion.In December 2021, Roche acquired a 100% controlling interest in Protocol First, Inc., a privately owned U.S. company based in Salt Lake City, UT, for $55 million. The acquisition provides Roche access to Protocol First’s software solutions which enhance clinical research efficiency.Lastly, during the year, Roche formed a collaboration with PathAI for artificial intelligence-based digital pathology applications for improved patient care. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology shows promise in advancing pathology imaging, which can benefit cancer patients through more precise diagnosis leading to targeted treatment.The collaboration with PathAI expands pathologist access to innovative AI-powered technology to support companion diagnostic and drug development programs. It also builds on Roche’s Digital Pathology Open Environment, expanding the company’s commitment to improving patient outcomes and advancing personalized healthcare through innovation. Roche will initially distribute PathAI-developed research-use-only (RUO) algorithms through NAVIFY Digital Pathology, spanning multiple cancer types. The combined innovation will expand support for healthcare companies’ companion diagnostic and drug development programs.",[],
