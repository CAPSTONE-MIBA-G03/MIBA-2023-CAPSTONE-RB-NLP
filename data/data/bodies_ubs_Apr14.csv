In recent weeks, Iqbal Khan, global head of wealth management at UBS, met with counterparts at Credit Suisse, including the lender's local wealth head Puneet Matta in Singapore, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter.

The move would give the Swiss lender a stronger foothold among the growing ranks of Indian billionaires while underscoring a return for Khan, who steered the private wealth business during his time at Credit Suisse before joining UBS in 2019.

Credit Suisse has around 40 wealth management employees in India and around 7,000 people. According to the bank's website, India is the second-largest footprint for Credit Suisse outside of Switzerland.

The considerations aren't final, the people said. UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment on the report to Bloomberg.

By 2014, UBS had opted to exit India's private-wealth market.

In recent months, UBS has already hired several Credit Suisse private bankers in Singapore to target India's wealthy client portfolio, including Gautam Anand, a managing director.

The $3.2 billion central-bank-brokered deal will shut off most of Credit Suisse's investment banking.

UBS Group also announced elimination of about 20 to 30% of jobs worldwide amid the takeover.

Price Action: UBS shares are down 1.42% at $21.20 on the last check Wednesday.

The National Council voted 102 to 71 to reject government guarantees authorized last month of CHF 100B (~$110B) to keep Credit Suisse (CS) from failing and CH 9B to help UBS (UBS) absorb losses it may incur as a result of the takeover, the Associated Press reported Wednesday.

The vote was mostly symbolic as a parliamentary commission had already approved the rescue plan, which mostly involved guarantees through the Swiss central bank, not parliament,

In addition, the upper house of the Swiss parliament had voted earlier to accept the transaction that was announced on March 19 by Switzerland's seven-member executive branch — known as the Federal Council land headed by the Swiss president — along with the Swiss National Bank and Finma, the Swiss financial markets regulator.

Debate on Wednesday was expected to focus on working out the differences between the two chambers, the AP said.

https://money.yahoo.com/50-000-stores-could-close-193032161.html,"50,000 Stores Could Close in the Next 5 Years, UBS Says","Store closures are expected to pick up again in 2023 and could total more than 50,000 in the next five years.

That’s according to a recent report from UBS, which found that store closures in 2023 are already up significantly compared to the prior year. In the last few months, various retailers have announced plans to consolidate their store bases and close stores. Foot Locker last month announced a decision to close more than 400 stores locations through 2026 focus on higher-performing doors. Walmart also recently announced a plan to close seven underperforming stores, including its last two pickup and delivery concept locations.

More from Footwear News

By the end of 2027, UBS estimates that about 50,000 stores will close across the current U.S. store count of about 940,000 stores, meaning there would be less than 5 percent fewer stores by the end of 2027.

Retailers have announced about 2,600 store closures and 5,100 store openings for the year, according to Coresight Research cited in BDO’s bi-annual bankruptcy report. Store openings this year have been mainly led by dollar store and discount chains, which have benefitted from cost-cutting consumers.

As for the reasons for the predicted closures, UBS outlined a few key factors. For starters, the cost to run a store is going up, especially as wages increase and rents stay high. At the same time, a general slowdown in consumer spending, less available credit and e-commerce growth are also to blame.

UBS predicts e-commerce penetration to grow from its current 20 percent to 26 percent by 2027, with 25 percent of online sales being fulfilled from stores. This model also assumes that retail sales grow 4 percent annually.

Story continues

The National Retail Federation forecast that retail sales will grow between 4 percent and 6 percent in 2023, with sales reaching between $5.13 trillion and $5.23 trillion this year. While NRF has said a recession is unlikely in 2023, a recession could result in even more store closures, UBS said.

The stores at risk of closures are those of smaller chains, department stores and specialty retailers with mainly discretionary items.

“In our view, these smaller chains and mom and pops are most at risk of closures given these firms typically have less access to capital needed to invest in developing a robust omnichannel offering,” UBS analysts wrote in the report.

Meanwhile, off-price retailers and dollar stores are set to continue to grow their presence as they resonate with cost-conscious consumers.

Like store closures, retail bankruptcies are set to come back into play in a big way in 2023 after a relatively slow year in 2022. Between the start of 2023 through the end of February, six major retailers filed for bankruptcy, according to BDO’s bi-annual bankruptcy report. That’s more than the total number of retail bankruptcies in 2022.

In some cases, these bankruptcies could correlate with store closures for chains as well.

https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/10/sell-mining-stocks-and-load-up-on-energy-ones-with-these-8-names-ubs.html,Sell these mining stocks and load up on 8 energy ones instead: UBS,"Sell mining shares and invest in energy stocks instead — that's the message from the Swiss investment bank UBS. On the one hand, the bank believes that ""unsynchronized"" global growth and recessionary concerns in the U.S. make it difficult for mining companies to perform well. On the other hand, UBS expects energy stocks to continue delivering bumper cash flow this year, according to UBS. ""Both sectors tend to benefit from rising global growth, but we don't expect that. That is why we think this is an appealing relative opportunity,"" UBS strategists led by Gerry Fowler wrote in a note to clients on April 3. ""Energy free cashflow is very high and we think sustainable. Mining free cashflow is set to deteriorate significantly, in our view."" The performance of both sectors has been weak so far this year, with the Stoxx Europe Basic Resources index down by 6.7% and the Stoxx Europe Energy index up by just 1.8%. However, UBS thinks investors have an opportunity to target the relative value between those two sectors as their paths diverge during this period of global growth. The following table shows eight buy-rated energy stocks with double-digit price targets. The table below shows six sell-rated mining stocks with significant downside to their price targets. UBS analysts have forecast that free cash flow from the mining sector will decline as bulk commodity prices retrace from their highs. Copper prices are still hovering around their highs for this decade at about $4 a pound. If commodity prices move lower toward their forecasts, UBS estimates that free cash flow from the sector will fall to little more than 5%. On the flip side, UBS said it believes that even if Brent crude oil trades at $85 per barrel in 2024, current market levels would still provide a free cash flow yield of around 15% for energy stocks. That's likely to happen for two reasons. First, valuations on energy companies are currently priced at a discount rate compared with pre-Covid levels, according to UBS, making them cheaper than before. Second, the bank's analysts said the U.S. economy is predicted not to grow significantly, causing demand to exceed supply again within the coming months and leading to potentially sharp falls in commodity prices.",['Ganesh Rao'],2023-04-10 00:00:00

https://www.investmentnews.com/credit-suisse-deal-will-make-ubs-a-wealth-management-powerhouse-jpmorgan-236257,Credit Suisse deal will make UBS a wealth management ‘powerhouse’: JPMorgan,"UBS Group’s $3.3 billion acquisition of rival Credit Suisse Group will transform it into a banking juggernaut at a bargain price, JPMorgan analysts said Tuesday.

The deal is set to turn UBS into a wealth management “powerhouse” with “one of the most attractive business models in global banking,” analysts led by Kian Abouhossein said in a research note. Meanwhile, the price paid is “attractive” for UBS even after factoring in potential losses on Credit Suisse assets, litigation costs and restructuring expenses, they said.

UBS bought Credit Suisse last month in a deal orchestrated by the Swiss government, following a collapse in confidence at the lender that threatened to trigger a broader financial crisis. UBS, already one of the world’s largest wealth managers, is now taking over a key rival for a fraction of the value of its assets and as much as 9 billion Swiss francs ($9.9 billion) in government loss guarantees.

UBS shares plunged after the deal announcement but they have since gained more than 10% as investors increasingly seem to see the terms as positive. By comparison, the Bloomberg Europe 500 Banks And Financial Services Index — a benchmark for the industry as a whole — has only increased by about 5% over the same period.

“The transaction has potential to be very attractive on an economic return-on-investment basis,” the analysts wrote. They forecast that the combined group could generate $7 billion in wealth management pretax profit by 2027.

However, the government-orchestrated rescue of Credit Suisse has met with some discontent among the Swiss population and politicians, with some lawmakers voicing their frustration over the government’s use of emergency measures at a parliamentary session on Tuesday.

Job cuts at Credit Suisse’s Swiss operations following the takeover could be delayed if they become “a political issue,” the JPMorgan analysts said in their note. Risks to the smooth execution of the deal could end up forcing UBS to sell or float the Credit Suisse’s domestic universal bank, which would fetch at least $10 billion in such a scenario.

That would “more than offset” the amount spent on the acquisition of the group by UBS, they wrote.

The company, which now has around one-third of its employees based in the U.S., inked its most high-profile stateside deal by putting the UBS name on the Isles’ arena as part of a 20-year pact. “It was an opportunity for us to demonstrate and accelerate our commitment and presence in the U.S.,” said Mesilati. “We viewed that this would be a highly visible destination for visitors across the globe, but also from the New York area, which is extremely important for our ultra-high net worth clients.” Mesilati also noted the timing of the deal, signed in July 2020, meant UBS was taking something of a chance on the bounceback of the live fan experience. “It was very counterintuitive to enter into a naming rights agreement in the middle of a global pandemic,” she said. “But we always had absolute confidence.”

STRONG AS OAK: One key area of collaboration between UBS and the Islanders at the local level has come in the form of the 43 Oak Foundation, a DEI-driven youth hockey program that UBS and the Islanders have pledged $1M toward over a five-year period. The effort, which has seen involvement from both Islanders and UBS execs, focuses on bringing down barriers to playing hockey for underprivileged and minority athletes, serving primarily N.Y. metro area players ages 12-22 by providing transportation, equipment, ice time, funding for travel and other resources -- not to mention mentorship from both Islanders and UBS senior execs. “We work very closely with the players on career development, interview skills,” Mesilati noted when talking about off-ice efforts within the program. “We can have generational impact there.” Participation in the initiative has grown 500% since its start, and has even expanded beyond the N.Y. metro area.

WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Another key sports sponsorship pact for UBS is with the Mercedes F1 team, which counts Lewis Hamilton and George Russell as drivers. Mesilati said the growth of F1 in the U.S. has “extremely important” to UBS -- something she attributed to the popularity of “Drive to Survive” on Netflix. “Miami is a core market for UBS,” Mesilati noted when discussing the race that debuted on the grounds of Hard Rock Stadium last year. “We have a huge percentage of our business in the Miami area. We were extremely over-subscribed. Huge amount of demand from our clients. … We cannot wait for Vegas. … It will be a huge platform for us.” UBS around two years ago also began sponsoring shows on streaming service PlayersTV to promote its wealth management services. That included “Front Office,” a Chris Paul-backed show focused on athlete entrepreneurs such as Michelle Wie, Mookie Betts and Travis Kelce. Two other shows -- “Long Game” and “Level Up” -- are hosted by former NFLer and current UBS exec Wale Ogunleye. “It really worked for us because it enabled a way for us to authentically engage with athletes,” said Mesilati.",[],2023-04-10 00:00:00

Investment bank UBS has signed a 12-year lease for 23,644 square feet at Skanska’s 17xM office tower in Downtown Washington, D.C., which is currently under construction.

This is the second lease at the property after law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher announced it would anchor the 11-story property at 1700 M Street NW, having signed a lease for 163,715 square feet back in 2021, Commercial Observer reported at the time.

Together the two leases bring the 334,000-square-foot property to 56 percent pre-leased.

Construction at the Kohn Pedersen Fox-designed building topped out last month, and it is scheduled for completion in 2024, at which point UBS will relocate, moving from its current offices at 1501 K Street NW, according to Skanska. The project was estimated to cost $216 million when the company first broke ground in 2021.

Skanska signed a long-term ground lease with JBG Smith in 2019, which owns the 34,000-square-foot property to develop on the site.

Brian Raher at Cushman & Wakefield represented UBS, while CBRE’s Randy Harrell, Jill Goubeaux, Joe Coleman and Lara Nealon represented Skanska in the deal, and are marketing the available space in the property.

https://www.retaildive.com/news/50k-stores-may-close-2027-ubs/647392/,More than 50K stores may close by 2027: UBS,"Dive Brief:

Slowing consumer spending, reduced availability of credit and rising penetration of e-commerce may contribute to the closure of 50,000 retail stores by 2027, UBS analysts led by Michael Lasser said in a report published Tuesday. That forecast is based on the assumption that 25% of online orders will be fulfilled by a retail store by 2027, up from 15% now.

If online penetration reaches 28-29% with 2.5% retail sales growth, up to 130,000 stores could close. Although that estimate is down from what UBS forecasted in 2021, with less access to capital needed to invest in omnichannel, smaller retail chains are most at risk of closing, the analysts said.

Retailers closed more stores than they opened in 2022, reversing a trend in 2021 that saw about 11,000 net stores added to the U.S. retail sector’s brick-and-mortar footprint. That trend is likely to continue “as a tough macro backdrop and shift in spending away from goods forces closures at smaller, undifferentiated retailers,” the analysts said.

Dive Insight:

Over 5,000 stores across all retail sectors have closed since January 2021 or are set to, according to UBS’s tally. “We believe this trend should continue in the years to come, with consumers consolidating their trips and shifting towards online channels. As underperforming retail stores are shuttered, it should help the store productivity of surviving locations,” the analysts said.

Excluding fuel and food service, the U.S. has a current base of about 940,000 retail stores.

UBS highlighted several factors that are driving retail store closures. They include higher costs, which raise the bar for keeping stores open; a decline in units per store in most retail sectors; and the likelihood that store closures will disproportionately affect smaller chains.

“We suspect the pace of store closures among smaller firms will accelerate going forward as online penetration climbs higher,” the analysts said.

From 2007 to 2019, firms with less than 500 employees closed about 40,000 stores, or 5% of their base, while retailers with more than 500 employees added 17,000 stores. The overall cost of doing business rose significantly in the last 12 months, due in part to higher wages. Retail hourly wages, which are typically the largest cost component of running a store, increased about 5% over the last years, the analysts said.

On top of that, retailers will need to increase store productivity by 4.5% annually as retail rents per square foot increase for neighborhood and community centers. “These costs will likely continue to move higher, increasing the hurdle rate to keep stores open,” UBS said.

About 14,000 of the estimated closings will be in the softlines sector. UBS forecasts that department stores and specialty retailers will remain net store closers. Retailers with a heavy mall presence are likely to continue store closings, but off-price retailers should grow units.

The report also singles out consumer electronics and home furnishings as retail sectors that also need to shrink their store footprint. Consumer electronics retailers should close about 9,000 stores, while home furniture stores should shrink by about 4,000 locations.

One change that’s become essential versus discretionary for retailers is an increasing embrace of digital investments like buy online, pay in store; ship from store; same-day delivery; and buy online, return in store. UBS says online retail spending per household was $9,900 in 2022, up from $8,900 a year ago and up from $4,000 in 2015. Companies with a strong DTC focus combined with high brand loyalty, like Nike and Levi’s, are best positioned for the ongoing shift to digital fulfillment.

And, the report notes, in-store fulfillment of digital orders may reduce the risk of store closures, especially for brands and specialty retailers. That shift to individual stores serving as digital fulfillment centers may also reduce the chance that unprofitable stores will close.",['Nate Delesline Iii'],2023-04-12 12:06:00

Colm Kelleher sounded like he was presiding over a funeral. The chairman of UBS Group AG struck a somber tone at the bank’s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, especially for someone who has just snagged potentially one of the biggest bargains ever in global banking. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Such seriousness is needed to keep its rescue of Credit Suisse Group AG on track in the face of a skeptical Swiss public and angry investors. The executives of both banks and leaders of Swiss authorities have put up a united front. Axel Lehmann, Credit Suisse’s chairman, toed the official line at that bank’s annual meeting Tuesday. “Ultimately, there were only two options: ‘deal’ or ‘bankruptcy,’” he told shareholders.

The takeover is agreed. It was driven by the Swiss government, central bank and financial regulator, and key officials around the world have signaled approval. All were worried about the consequences for the global financial system if Credit Suisse failed chaotically.

But plenty of room for argument remains. Some Credit Suisse shareholders at Tuesday’s meeting demanded more detail on how the low takeover price was decided, while a major Swiss proxy advisor said it could be contested. Junior bondholders, who were wiped out, are drawing up lawsuits. The dominant market share of the combined UBS-Credit Suisse within Switzerland will also face challenges.

UBS Vice Chairman Lukas Gaehwiler tacitly acknowledged worries about domestic competition on Wednesday by saying all options would be considered for Credit Suisse’s local business, which will continue to exist as a brand for now. UBS definitely wants to keep it. Before the deal, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. among others valued Credit Suisse’s domestic business at a minimum $11 billion, or nearly four times what UBS is paying for the entire group. Credit Suisse shareholders have grounds for their grievance.

As a reminder, UBS is buying its long-time rival for a slim fraction of its last reported book value. Credit Suisse needed to be rescued from a ruinous run on its deposits and liquid assets. The Swiss authorities who sponsored the takeover have all said the bank would have become insolvent had it opened on Monday, March 20. Bankruptcy would very likely have caused mayhem for the Swiss financial system and been extremely disruptive for banks and markets far beyond.

However, the takeover is hugely unpopular in Switzerland, according to early polls. Credit Suisse shareholders are unsurprisingly angry and sad. Many still don’t fully understand exactly how the deal was negotiated and the price was set. Credit Suisse shareholders are getting 1 UBS share for each 22.48 shares they currently own. On the Sunday when the deal was struck, that valued Credit Suisse’s shares at less than half the price they closed at the previous Friday and only 7% of its last reported tangible book value per share.

There are huge operational and financial risks for UBS, particularly in winding down the large parts of Credit Suisse’s investment bank and trading operations that it doesn’t want. That’s why Kelleher swiftly replaced Ralph Hamers as chief executive officer with former UBS head Sergio Ermotti. And yet the bargain price it is paying and the extra capital injection gained from the writeoff of Credit Suisse’s junior bonds, gives Kelleher and his team a big cushion against losses.

UBS, already the world’s second-biggest wealth manager, is gaining a big step-up in this business, especially in the US and Asia. A year ago, the bank was set to pay $1.4 billion for a startup US wealth business with $27 billion in assets. Now, it is paying barely more than double that amount for more than 50 times the assets in Credit Suisse’s wealth units, as Bloomberg News noted.

This deal means UBS can challenge the world-leading position of Kelleher’s former employer, Morgan Stanley. He saw how a series of large-scale takeovers transformed Morgan Stanley from an investment bank severely wounded by the 2008 crisis into a much lower risk and more profitable global wealth manager.

The integration of Credit Suisse’s global wealth business will be hard work and the combined bank will likely lose assets from clients that previously banked with both institutions. But this is the kind of dream trade Kelleher could barely have imagined possible when becoming UBS chairman last year. Really, he must be over the moon.

His funereal tone was necessary because the politics are so fractious. But UBS could neutralize much of this by spinning off or listing Credit Suisse’s domestic Swiss bank and offering more compensation to its former investors with extra shares in that unit, for example.

The prize for UBS is Credit Suisse’s wealth business. The difficult and dangerous part is its investment bank. The domestic Swiss business could be the bargaining chip that Kelleher can use to ease the protests and complaints that a much enlarged UBS provokes. Play that chip well and he can turn the wake for Credit Suisse into a proper celebration.

https://news.yahoo.com/swiss-parliament-grapples-compromise-ubs-072753540.html,Swiss Parliament Nears Deal on UBS Guarantees as MPs Change Vote,"(Bloomberg) -- Swiss parliament is approaching a deal to push through government guarantees for UBS Group AG’s takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG after a upper houses compromise was met with approval in the lower chamber.

Most Read from Bloomberg

“The majority of our party will vote for this proposal if the government will pursue higher capital ratios and restricted bonuses,” Social Democrat lawmaker Roger Nordmann said in the lower house in Bern on Wednesday. The stricter stance on banks is “a major development,” he said.

The 200-member lower house late on Tuesday voted against the 109 billion francs ($120 billion) in guarantees. While that was a symbolic vote that can’t stop the deal, it clashed with the upper house’s approval earlier in the day.

As a stalemate would force the bill to fail, the upper house earlier today adopted amendments in line with what their lower-house colleagues had demanded. Those provisions seek to adjust the law to limit the risks systemically relevant banks pose to taxpayers.

Comments by Nordmann and other lower-house lawmakers now suggest that a majority will be achieved in both chambers, allowing Switzerland to avoid an embarrassing situation.

Irrespective of the vote, parliament can’t stop the takeover negotiated last month as the government already got approval from a small group of senior lawmakers, which is entitled to act on behalf of parliament in case of urgency.

The key demand the upper house now passed calls on the government to revise banking laws demanding higher capital requirements and restrictions on bonuses. But lawmakers’ agreed wording only stipulates that the executive should “examine” this, not that it is “instructed” to do so.

Story continues

“We are agreed that after the events of March 19 we cannot just move on,” said Pirmin Bischof, a Center Alliance member in the upper house, referring to the day the deal was agreed. “The too-big-to-fail regulation just simply didn’t have any effect. And so we need to ask the government to come up with a changed law that will solve this problem.”

Symbolic Vote

The lower house’s rejection — just before midnight on Tuesday — highlights the anger among lawmakers on both sides of the political spectrum ahead of national elections later this year. An overall rejection would send a signal of Switzerland’s legislative not backing the deal, which some MPs suggested should be done.

“We should only approve a deal when it’s good enough for the Confederation — right now this deal is only good enough for UBS,” said Thomas Minder, adding that a ‘no’ wouldn’t be the “end of the world.”

Lawmakers also acknowledged their lack of power of actually influencing the deal.

“If we could really turn down the loans here, I believe nobody would hesitate,” said Eva Herzog of the Social Democrats.

The standoff is largely symbolic. The government had said that “if parliament refuses subsequent approval, it will be tantamount to a political reprimand” for the group of senior lawmakers that green-lit it, but would have “no legal effect.”

The Credit Suisse crisis three weeks ago has shaken Switzerland, evoking memories of the Great Financial Crisis. The government argued on Tuesday that the creation of a Swiss banking juggernaut was the best solution among a limited number of options.

In addition to state guarantees, the Swiss National Bank offered liquidity assistance. SNB sight deposit numbers published this week suggest that after accessing such money, Credit Suisse may have returned more than half of the funds.

Switzerland’s executive isn’t made up of a coalition or an outright majority, but of seven ministers from the country’s four largest parties. They usually make decisions by consensus and try to find pragmatic compromises — often outside of party lines.

Ministers don’t publicly oppose government decisions, irrespective of their parties’ stance on a matter or how they personally voted behind closed doors.

This setup means that parliament offers parties the most prominent platform to sway voters, which explains aggressive comments in that forum even if they at times lack bite.

Here’s a full picture of job cuts around the world.

Share this article









UBS Group AG's reported plan to lay off as many as 36,000 workers would make it the company with the largest job cuts globally in the past six months.

The cuts, which were reported by Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung on Sunday, could reduce the combined workforce by as much as 30% as part of UBS’s takeover of long-time rival Credit Suisse Group AG. Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann apologized at the bank’s annual shareholder meeting for failing to save the 167-year-old lender. UBS hasn’t commented on the layoffs.

The layoffs come on the heels of last month’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which sent shockwaves through an economy already shaken by mass layoffs and under pressure from central banks locked in a high-stakes battle with inflation — sharpening the risk of recession and even greater job losses.

While the US economy has so far remained strong, adding 311,000 jobs in February after adding more than half a million jobs in January, central banks’ increasingly aggressive campaign of rate hikes may expose more vulnerabilities in banks with interest-rate risk, like SVB, and startups that rely heavily on venture capital funding to maintain operations and payrolls.

The rush of layoffs that began late last year isn’t letting up, marking the worst start to a year since 2009, with 52,000 jobs lost in one week in January alone. Since Oct. 1, executives across sectors have sacked almost 538,000 employees around the world, according to a comprehensive review of layoffs by Bloomberg News.

Second only to UBS, Amazon.com Inc will wipe out close to 30,000 jobs with the most recent round of layoffs announced March 20. Meta Platforms Inc. takes third place, with a sweeping 21,000 roles eliminated. But they’re just three of 760 firms that have slashed more than half a million jobs since October, with the median layoff leaving the company workforce 10% smaller, according to Bloomberg’s analysis. Another 108 companies made cuts without specifying how many employees were given pink slips.

The tech sector has seen some of the biggest losses, accounting for almost a third of the total cuts. Company leaders said they overhired as demand for their services surged during the pandemic. The mass layoffs stunned many Silicon Valley workers, who had long enjoyed generous pay and cushy benefits. Management has promised investors a new era of austerity, with Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg calling 2023 the “year of efficiency.”

The carnage extends far beyond technology. Out of all the cuts where the share of jobs axed was reported or could be derived, the median tech layoff sent 10% of the company’s employees packing. In the communications, financials, health care, real estate and energy sectors, the median layoffs were as big or bigger, even though the total job losses were smaller. In health care, for example, the median reduction in workers was 21% across more than 130 layoffs, driven by massive cuts at small startups like Rubius Therapeutics Inc., which let go of more than 80% of its staff in November.

The consumer discretionary sector has eliminated more than 110,000 roles, as demand falters and sales at outlets like Amazon fall short of expectations. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and other big banks cut thousands of jobs despite glimmers of hope on Wall Street of a soft landing.

Source: Data compiled by Bloomberg

Energy companies were among the least affected, with fewer than 4,000 jobs cut. Major oil companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron have raked in record profits and announced massive stock buybacks as Russia’s war in Ukraine caused a surge in energy prices.

Across sectors, job security and stability have emerged as priorities for many workers. Around 4 million US workers quit their jobs in February, down from Covid-era highs though still hovering above pre-pandemic norms.

Overall, the layoffs have been remarkably concentrated. Almost half of the job cuts were carried out by just two dozen companies, including big names like FedEx, Ikea and Philips.

https://news.yahoo.com/swiss-lower-house-votes-second-122149689.html,Swiss Lower House Censures UBS Guarantees in Symbolic Vote,"(Bloomberg) -- Switzerland’s lower house made a symbolic vote against providing state guarantees for UBS Group AG’s takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG, reflecting a high degree of public discontent with the deal.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The lower house rejected a compromise offered by the upper house, leading to a failure of the bill and ending parliamentary proceedings. Irrespective of the vote, parliament can’t stop the takeover negotiated last month as a designated committee of lawmakers had already signed off on it.

The rejection nonetheless casts a shadow over the already-fraught process of integrating two global banks, particularly as significant job cuts loom in Switzerland in a year when national elections are due. In the aftermath of the historic $3.3 billion deal, lawmakers have called for various changes including greater powers for the financial regulator Finma, though little consensus has emerged.

“The majority in parliament wanted to make a statement,” said Michael Hermann, a political scientist and head of Zurich-based research institute Sotomo. “This shows that the topic politically causes high waves in Switzerland.”

A coalition of the populist right and the left generated enough votes to ensure the bill didn’t pass. It would have given the stamp of approval for putting state funds of as much $120 billion at stake. The Swiss People’s Party SVP, which forms the largest bloc, lobbied together with the Greens and some Social Democrats against it.

“The SVP has been insisting since 2008 that we have no bank that cannot go bankrupt,” said Pirmin Schwander, a member of the lower house for the party. The state guarantees only fuel a “narcissistic company culture” among bankers, he said.

UBS Effect

The vote, with 103 ballots against, 71 in favor and eight abstentions, is a defeat for Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter and the delegation of senior lawmakers which agreed to the backstop on behalf of parliament before the takeover was announced in March.

The debate is unlikely to have any immediate effect on UBS, but may indicate appetite for stricter rules on the horizon. UBS has already faced questions over the combined company’s heft — double the size of the Swiss economy — and its potential local dominance. UBS’s vice chairman said last week that the bank will consider all options for Credit Suisse’s Swiss unit.

The Swiss government earlier this month said that UBS must ensure its pay structures encourage employees to avoid using the state guarantee.

Politicians and business leaders had voiced worries that the combined lender will have excessive market power, leading to a loss of competition. Despite the risks involved in integrating Credit Suisse, UBS stands to become a banking “powerhouse” post merger, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in a note Tuesday.

The deal was also met with little public enthusiasm.

During the afternoon it looked like the parliament in Bern could reach an agreement, with some Social Democrats changing their views. A stricter stance on banks — a compromise had lined out higher equity requirements and restricted bonuses — is “a major development,” Social Democrat lawmaker Roger Nordmann had said.

“The debate is ticked off now. There will be no further cleanup of the differences between parliament and government,” Sotomo’s Hermann said. “Now everyone can feel vindicated again that democracy has been eroded. This discontent with the system will further strengthen populists and the far right.”

Swiss Politics

Switzerland’s executive isn’t made up of a coalition or an outright majority, but of seven ministers from the country’s four largest parties. They usually make decisions by consensus and try to find pragmatic compromises — often outside of party lines.

Ministers don’t publicly oppose government decisions, irrespective of their parties’ stance on a matter or how they personally voted behind closed doors.

GENEVA -- The UBS chairman voiced confidence Wednesday that the Swiss bank will succeed in a government-engineered takeover of hobbled rival Credit Suisse, pledging the deal will reduce costs, benefit shareholders and buttress Swiss finance despite “huge” risks in knitting the global lenders together.

Speaking to UBS shareholders, Colm Kelleher gave an overview of the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.25 billion) takeover that he said would close in the next few months, alluding to the complexity of the first-ever merger of two “global systemically important banks.”

Swiss government officials and regulators hastily orchestrated the deal that was announced on March 19 after Credit Suisse’s stock plunged and jittery depositors quickly pulled out their money.

Authorities feared that a teetering Credit Suisse could further roil global financial markets following the collapse of two U.S. banks.

“Whilst we did not initiate these discussions, we believe that this transaction is financially attractive for UBS shareholders,” Kelleher said at the annual shareholders meeting in the Swiss city of Basel. “I’m convinced that we made the right choice.""

Kelleher said fully integrating the banks is expected to take three to four years and that while UBS is “laser-focused on integrating Credit Suisse,” there are possible pitfalls.

“There is a huge amount of risk in integrating these businesses,” he said. “But let me assure you, we are doing everything to execute this deal in the best possible way in order not to let it compromise our financial strength or stability.”

UBS executives did not face the same outcry that Credit Suisse shareholders unleashed a day earlier at what was likely the 167-year-old bank’s last annual general meeting. On Tuesday, Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann acknowledged the anger and apologized for the failures leading up to the bank’s rescue.

The Swiss attorney general’s office has opened a probe into events surrounding Credit Suisse ahead of the UBS takeover, and the executive branch on Wednesday ordered tens of millions in cuts to the bonuses of top Credit Suisse executives.

Swiss regulators, meanwhile, said the takeover was “the best option,” offering the least risk of fanning a wider crisis and damaging Switzerland’s standing as a financial center.

The merger “minimized risk of contagion and maximized trust,"" said Urban Angehrn, chief executive of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or FINMA.

Two other solutions — a takeover by the Swiss government or putting Credit Suisse into insolvency proceedings — had serious drawbacks, he said Wednesday.

Insolvency would have left the functional parts of Credit Suisse in operation as a Swiss-only bank, but one with a “damaged reputation” through bankruptcy, he told reporters in the Swiss capital of Bern. A temporary takeover by the Swiss government would have exposed taxpayers to the risk of losses.

“One can well imagine what devastating effect the insolvency of a big wealth management bank of Credit Suisse AG would have had on Swiss private banking,” Angehrn said. “Many other Swiss banks could have faced a bank run, just as Credit Suisse did itself in the fourth quarter.”

The world’s biggest banks, including Credit Suisse and UBS, are required to submit emergency plans for winding them up if they fail, emerging from international negotiations aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2008 global financial crisis triggered by the failure of globally connected U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers.

Triggering such an emergency plan “would have achieved its immediate aim” of preserving payments and supporting the economy in Switzerland, Angehrn said.

“But the damage to Switzerland as a place to do business, to the reputation of Switzerland, to tax revenue and jobs, would have been enormous,” he said.

Shareholders did not get to vote on the merger after the Swiss government passed an emergency ordinance to bypass that step.

Kelleher acknowledged that the government-organized deal meant UBS shareholders could not be consulted before the takeover was announced.

“I understand that not all stakeholders of UBS and Credit Suisse are pleased with this approach,” he said.

At the meeting, UBS shareholders approved reelection of the board, compensation for executives and a 10% increase to the 2022 dividend, totaling $7.3 billion after the bank recorded a net profit of $7.6 billion last year.

“We have laid the foundation that now puts us in a position to stabilize Credit Suisse for the benefit of both banks and the Swiss financial center,” Kelleher said.

BASEL, April 5 (Reuters) - UBS's (UBSG.S) Chairman told the bank's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday that the takeover of rival Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) was a significant milestone for Switzerland and for the global financial industry.

Swiss regulators explained Wednesday that last month's controversial decision to sell off the country's troubled Credit Suisse bank cheaply was the best available solution to limit the risk of contagion to the global financial system. File Photo by Hugo Philpott/UPI | License Photo

April 5 (UPI) -- Switzerland's financial regulator sought Wednesday to justify the controversial decision made by the government and central bank to sell Credit Suisse to rival UBS for $3.2 billion, imposing massive losses on investors. The Financial Markets Authority, or FINMA, said that following a six-month run on the bank it had four pre-prepared options on the day -- two of them ready to be signed -- resolution, nationalization, bankruptcy or a takeover. Advertisement

Resolution and temporary nationalization were ruled out due to requiring more state funds and 100% investor bail-ins while the contagion risk to the global financial system of bankruptcy was considered so high that a takeover was deemed the least harmful solution, FINMA said.

""After carefully weighing up the advantages and disadvantages and the potential upsides and downsides, everyone involved came to the same conclusion,"" CEO Urban Angehrn said. ""In this specific situation, a takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS was the best option available.""

Anghern said the merger was the option that would most likely ""stabilize the situation"" and prevent the crisis from spreading further.

""As a global systemically important institution, Credit Suisse is not just any bank. The nature of the bank's business means it is highly interconnected with other market participants, both in Switzerland and globally,"" he said.

Angehrn said the current fragile state of the financial markets due to the shift to monetary tightening in 2022, the uncertain economic outlook, the Silicon Valley Bank and Signatures Bank crises in the United States and the whole geopolitical backdrop were also relevant to the decision.

RELATED Swiss prosecutor to investigate UBS takeover of Credit Suisse

""There was a high probability that the resolution of a global systemically important bank would have led to contagion effects and jeopardized financial stability in Switzerland and globally,"" he said.

The March 19 rescue deal saw Credit Suisse, which at the end of 2022 has assets of $1.4 trillion, sold for just $3.2 billion with shareholders receiving one UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares they held.

Already wounded from a series of scandals and incidents, withdrawals on a ""globally and historically unprecedented scale"" totaling $153 billion in the fourth quarter caused the market's assessment of Credit Suisse's business model and the future to falter.

FINMA said that was the trigger for it to enter into an even closer, daily exchange with the bank from this point on, and in particular closely monitor Credit Suisse's liquidity situation.

A Federal Department of Finance-led steering committee was set up and met repeatedly with FINMA's committee on financial crises along with the Swiss National Bank.

Credit Suisse was ordered to prove it had contingency measures in place including risk reduction and strengthening capital and liquidity and to do everything possible to prepare for a potential sale, including finding a buyer.

But that effort was overtaken by last month's mini-banking crisis in the United States which threatened to topple Credit Suisse, forcing FINMA and SNB to cobble together the merger with rival UBS behind closed doors on a Sunday afternoon.

The deal has been mired in controversy ever since with FINMA forced to defend a decision ordering Credit Suisse to write down $17 billion worth of junior bonds to zero, UBS' CEO replaced and the country's top prosecutor launching a criminal probe into the takeover.",['Paul Godfrey'],2023-04-05 00:00:00

LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - The Bank of England has approved UBS Group AG's (UBSG.S) takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S) in the United Kingdom, people familiar with the process told Reuters, a key market for the Swiss lenders racing to close the rescue deal.

Reuters could not establish if any conditions have been requested for the approval, which comes less than three weeks since the takeover was announced and reflects the urgency surrounding the transaction.

Change of control approvals by regulators typically can take up to 60 working days to secure in Britain. Representatives for UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment.

On March 19, just after the deal was announced, the Bank of England said it welcomed ""the comprehensive set of actions set out by the Swiss authorities today in order to support financial stability,"" without elaborating.

UBS needs 58 countries to sign off on the combination that will make Switzerland biggest bank a wealth management giant with more than $3 trillion in assets. The longer the deal takes to close, the harder it could be for Credit Suisse to hold on to its business.

The United Kingdom, where Credit Suisse has $60 billion of risk-weighted assets primarily in its investment banking division, is one of its biggest markets outside of Switzerland.

UBS on Tuesday also secured a temporary green light from European Union antitrust regulators to complete its acquisition of Credit Suisse, but will still have to request clearance under EU merger rules, the European Commission said.

UBS Chief Executive Officer Ralph Hamers, who will step down on Wednesday after the annual shareholder meeting, told reporters on March 29 that ""plans can only partially be developed"" because Credit Suisse is still a separate company.

""That's why it's very important that we get the regulators support globally and as soon as possible,"" he said.

John Glen, chief secretary to the UK Treasury, said last week he did not have any immediate concerns about the execution of Switzerland's Credit Suisse rescue by UBS.

UBS’ stock (NYSE: UBS) has gained 14% YTD, whereas the S&P500 has increased 7% over the same period. Further, at the current price of $20 per share, it is 13% below its fair value of $23 – Trefis’ estimate for UBS’s valuation. The bank agreed to acquire Credit Suisse earlier this month for $3.2 billion. Notably, the deal was pushed by Swiss regulators to bail out Credit Suisse from its difficult liquidity position. While details about the integration are yet to be officially disclosed, it is likely to take 3-4 years.

The Swiss bank posted better-than-expected profits in the fourth quarter of 2022, despite an 8% drop in total revenues to $8.03 billion. The top line suffered due to a 24% decrease in investment bank revenues, followed by a 31% decline in asset management, and a 5% drop in the global wealth management divisions. That said, the personal & corporate banking revenues grew 5% y-o-y driven by higher net interest income. Further, the noninterest expenses decreased 13% y-o-y, leading to an adjusted net income of $1.65 billion – up 23% y-o-y.

UBS’s net revenues marginally decreased to $34.56 billion in FY2022. It was driven by a 2% decrease in wealth management and an 8% drop in the investment bank units, almost offset by a 13% increase in asset management and a 1% rise in personal & corporate banking revenues. On the cost front, the operating expenses were reduced by 4% y-o-y, improving the adjusted net income by 2% y-o-y to $7.63 billion.

Moving forward, we forecast UBS’ revenues to remain around $35.23 billion in FY2023. Additionally, UBS’ adjusted net income margin is likely to remain around the same level as the previous year. It will likely result in an annual GAAP EPS of $2.32, which coupled with a P/E multiple of just just below 10x will lead to a valuation of $23.

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/swiss-lawmakers-open-session-looking-at-ubs-credit-suisse-deal-63d064b9,Swiss lawmakers open session looking at UBS-Credit Suisse deal,"GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland’s parliament is opening a special session Tuesday to scrutinize the state-imposed takeover of Swiss bank Credit Suisse by rival UBS — and possibly considering strengthening the legal arsenal to better gird against financial blowups.

The debate could run up to three days, with expectations that lawmakers will voice — and need to iron out — disagreements over the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.25 billion) fusion of the country’s top two banks, a thunderclap for a country that prides itself on finesse and acumen in finance.

Swiss authorities stepped in as shares of Credit Suisse CSGN, -0.17% CS, +3.26% and other banks plunged last month after the failure of two U.S. banks sparked concerns about other potentially shaky institutions in the global financial system. Credit Suisse is among 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

Lawmakers were expected to raise concerns about thousands of expected job cuts, discuss possible strengthening of banking laws and accountability for long-troubled Credit Suisse, and look at state-backed guarantees of over $100 billion aimed both at holding the bank together until the merger is completed and buttressing UBS UBSG, +0.08% UBS, +1.69% against possible losses as it combines with its rival.

They also were likely to consider what it will mean that Switzerland is set to have one giant bank.

Despite the talk, few concrete results were expected from the session, which is primarily expected to flesh out ideas — and possibly some vitriol — from lawmakers who all face reelection this fall.

Yvan Lengwiler, an economics professor at the University of Basel, suggested that the debate would play into a longtime “tug-of-war” between lawmakers who have lobbied in favor of Swiss banks over the years and others who have long sought to stiffen regulation.

“It seems that the pendulum, after this debacle we’ve seen, has clearly shifted towards strengthening,” he said. “Two years from now … the political situation might be very different, and it could be quite difficult to get this through parliament.”",['Associated Press'],

https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ubs-faces-investors-after-shotgun-credit-suisse-merger-2023-04-05/,UBS tells investors 'Herculean' Credit Suisse takeover will pay off,"













BASEL, April 5 (Reuters) - UBS (UBSG.S) executives sought to assure investors on Wednesday that Switzerland's largest bank can make its unexpected takeover of Swiss rival Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) work and pay off for its shareholders.

While describing the biggest bank rescue since the global financial crisis as a milestone for the industry and a major challenge for the bank, Chairman Colm Kelleher told UBS shareholders it also meant ""a new beginning and huge opportunities ahead for the combined bank and for the Swiss financial center as a whole.""

Last month, Swiss authorities announced that UBS would buy Credit Suisse in a shotgun merger to stem further banking turmoil after the smaller lender had come to the brink of collapse.

After a run on deposits, the Swiss government had turned to UBS, which agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), while the Alpine state put up more than 200 billion francs of support and guarantees.

Kelleher told the bank's shareholder meeting in Basel UBS was confident in its ability to successfully manage Credit Suisse's integration and that the combined bank would remain well capitalized.

""We believe the transaction is financially attractive for UBS shareholders,"" he said.

The hastily arranged rescue, not only angered and unsettled both banks' shareholders, but also many in Switzerland.

A survey by political research firm gfs.bern found a majority of Swiss did not support the deal that would create a financial institution with assets double the size of the country's annual economic output.

As shareholders expressed their frustration about being kept in the dark, with one calling it ""an insult,"" some also voiced concerns about potential job losses and the new giant bank's adverse impact on competition.

Vice Chairman Lukas Gaehwiler sought to quell such fears saying there were around 250 banks in the country and therefore enough competition.

He also said it was too early to speculate about jobs before the ""Herculean task"" of the merger had completed, which he expected to happen within a few months.

On Sunday, Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger cited an unnamed senior UBS manager as saying that the workforce of the combined group could shrink by 20-30%.

ALL OPTIONS ON TABLE

Gaehwiler also said that ""all options are on the table"" concerning Credit Suisse's domestic business, which would continue to operate under its old brand in Switzerland for the foreseeable future.

Shareholders also took aim at the executives' pay and bonus packages, which made Ralph Hamers the best paid chief executive in Switzerland in 2022.

In contrast to its smaller rival, UBS had been on a steady course. It reported a net profit of $7.6 billion for 2022 and strong inflows in wealth management, the company's flagship division.

Looking at how to navigate the mammoth task of integrating Credit Suisse, the success of which Switzerland depends on, UBS has already taken the first steps. Last week, the bank announced it had rehired Sergio Ermotti as chief executive to steer the massive takeover - a surprise move to take advantage of the Swiss banker's experience rebuilding the bank after the global financial crisis.

Addressing shareholders for the final time as chief executive, Hamers acknowledged the merger has led to new priorities for the bank, bringing a change at its helm.

""The acquisition of Credit Suisse will be a major challenge,"" Hamers said, while echoing the bank's chairman in highlighting new opportunities.

""It is expected to create a business with more than USD 5 trillion in total invested assets,"" he said.

On Wednesday UBS shareholders re-elected Kelleher as chairman, as well as all existing members of the board of directors, and approved their and bank executives' compensation.

Wednesday also marked Ermotti's first official day back in the job, although he did not attend the meeting.

It came a day after executives at Credit Suisse faced their own shareholders and Chairman Axel Lehmann apologised for leading the bank to the verge of bankruptcy.

In the face of growing criticism, Switzerland's financial regulator deflected blame for the collapse of Credit Suisse, saying it had been quick to respond, calling instead for more powers to take lenders to task.

On Tuesday, Reuters also reported that the Bank of England had approved UBS' takeover of Credit Suisse in Britain, a key market for the Swiss lenders racing to close the rescue deal.

UBS also secured a temporary green light from European Union antitrust regulators to complete its acquisition of Credit Suisse, but will still have to request clearance under EU merger rules, the European Commission said.

FRANKFURT — Swiss banking giant UBS will buy the country’s second-largest bank Credit Suisse in a deal that will come as a relief to financial markets in Europe and across the world.

UBS said in a statement that the total price is 3 billion Swiss francs, or about $3.25 billion, in UBS shares.

The deal was pushed through in an effort to avoid further turmoil in global banking following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and another regional lender in the U.S.

“With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,” the Swiss National Bank said in a separate statement, noting that the deal was made possible with the support of the Swiss federal government, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA and the Swiss National Bank.

The central bank added that UBS and Credit Suisse can obtain a liquidity assistance loan of up to 100 billion francs.

Highlighting the urgency of securing a deal for the bank before markets open on Monday, Swiss authorities adjusted laws to allow further provision of liquidity by the Swiss central bank, while the government agreed to provide additional guarantees.

The expeditious rescue of Credit Suisse was welcomed by the European Central Bank as well as the Federal Reserve in the U.S.

The ""swift action"" by the Swiss authorities ""are instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said in a statement.

The 167-year-old Credit Suisse has been involved in a series of scandals that have undermined the confidence of investors and clients. It has thus found itself in the eye of the storm when the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank sparked fears of a banking crisis.","['More ...', 'Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority', 'Finma']",2023-03-19 19:15:09+00:00

UBS sought to reassure investors at its annual general meeting on Wednesday against a fraught political backdrop following its takeover of fallen rival Credit Suisse last month. The 1,128 shareholders gathered in Basel were looking for clarity on the board's integration plan after the ""shotgun wedding"" between Switzerland's two biggest banks, which remains mired in controversy, legal peril and public skepticism. related investing news UBS says it's time to buy this banking giant with very low risk ahead UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher told the audience that March 19, the date of the emergency rescue of Credit Suisse from the brink of collapse, was a ""historic day and a day we hoped would never come."" But he said the merger also presents ""a new beginning and huge opportunities ahead for the combined bank and the Swiss financial sector as a whole."" He emphasized UBS' continued focus on its wealth management and Swiss business and confirmed that the bank would reduce the capital allocated to its investment arm to below 25% of risk-weighted assets. ""Whilst we did not initiate these discussions, we believe that this transaction is financially attractive to UBS shareholders,"" Kelleher said, while acknowledging there is a ""huge amount of risk"" associated with the integration.

The Credit Suisse integration is expected to take around three to four years, excluding Credit Suisse's non-core investment bank portfolio. Kelleher said the bank expects to remain well capitalized and ""significantly above"" its capital targets by the time the deal closes. New UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti began his second tenure on Wednesday after his shock reappointment last week, with the board having decided that he was the right man to lead the mammoth task of integrating the bank's fallen compatriot's business. Ermotti's return was seen by many commentators as an attempt to restore calm, as the country's long-established reputation for financial stability teeters on the brink. UBS reported a full-year profit of $7.6 billion in 2022, and its shares remain up more than 10% since the turn of the year. Concerns remain over the scale of the new entity, which will have more than $5 trillion in total invested assets, and whether it creates too much concentrated risk for the Swiss and global economy.

Reports have suggested that UBS' plans may include job cuts of around 20-30% of the combined entity's global workforce, but the bank's Vice Chairman said Wednesday that it was too early to offer any concrete estimates. Credit Suisse held the final independent AGM in its 167-year history in Zurich on Tuesday, after Swiss authorities brokered an ""emergency rescue"" in late March, when the bank's share price tumbled and depositors fled en masse. The board was angrily confronted on Tuesday by shareholders demanding answers and accountability over the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.3 billion) deal, which was rushed through over the course of a weekend and denied both UBS and Credit Suisse shareholders a vote. Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann said he was ""truly sorry"" to shareholders, clients and employees, and suggested the bank's turnaround plan after years of losses, scandals and compliance failures had been on track until turmoil in the U.S. banking sector sparked a flight of confidence.

ZURICH, April 6 (Reuters) - UBS (UBSG.S) Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti has told Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) staff it is ""critical"" to remain focused on clients and keeping the business running as the merger of the two banks proceeds, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

""We cannot let ourselves get overly distracted by the integration efforts,"" Ermotti said in the memo. ""It's critical for us to remain focused on supporting our clients and maintaining operational excellence.""

Last month, Swiss authorities announced that UBS would buy Credit Suisse in a shotgun merger to stem further banking turmoil after the smaller lender had come to the brink of collapse.

UBS announced last week it was rehiring Ermotti as CEO, its former boss from 2011 to 2020, to steer the takeover which will create one bank with $1.6 trillion in assets and more than 120,000 staff.

In his first communication to Credit Suisse staff after taking over as UBS CEO, Ermotti said there would be ""change and hard decisions"" ahead.

Still, he tried to calm the nerves of anxious employees worried about massive lay-offs and upheaval ahead.

The bank created by the merger is poised to reduce its workforce by 20%-30%, Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger reported at the weekend, citing an unnamed senior UBS manager.

UBS Vice Chairman Lukas Gaehwiler told the bank's shareholders on Wednesday that it was too early to speculate about job cuts.

Ermotti asked staff to be patient while the company worked out its next moves.

""While it’s too soon to speculate about the end state of the combined organization, you have my commitment that we will treat all employees of both Credit Suisse and UBS fairly,"" he wrote.

https://www.complianceweek.com/risk-management/ubs-prepping-for-herculean-task-of-integrating-credit-suisse/32927.article,UBS prepping for ‘Herculean task’ of integrating Credit Suisse,"Senior leadership at UBS acknowledged the significant work ahead of Switzerland’s largest bank as it begins preparing to absorb the country’s second-largest bank, Credit Suisse.

“Both banks have to be continued and integrated in the coming years,” said Lukas Gähwiler, UBS’s vice chairman of the board of directors, during the bank’s annual general meeting of shareholders Wednesday. “This is a Herculean task that will need more rather than fewer people in the short run.”

UBS announced March 19 it would purchase Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs (U.S. $3.3 billion) after the latter institution was deemed at risk of becoming illiquid as depositors raced to withdraw their funds from the bank. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) stepped in to help coordinate the merger once it determined recent initiatives undertaken by Credit Suisse to overhaul its risk management practices and restore its reputation weren’t enough to restore confidence in the bank.

Gähwiler said UBS had only 48 hours to carry out due diligence before the takeover was announced.

“Our primary priority is to stabilize Credit Suisse’s client business,” he said. “We did not go looking for this transaction. But everyone concerned agreed that a takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS would minimize the damage for Switzerland and the insecurity on international financial markets.”

He estimated the merger would likely take months to complete and that working at speed is paramount to stem the “great uncertainty” lingering while the deal is underway. Another issue facing the planned acquisition is an investigation launched by Swiss prosecutors earlier this week to determine if criminal offenses were committed while the rushed transaction was executed.

UBS has already made changes to its executive ranks to prepare for the Credit Suisse integration, announcing March 29 that Sergio Ermotti would return to the bank as group chief executive officer. Ermotti was previously the Group CEO of UBS for nine years and “successfully repositioned UBS following the severe challenges arising from the global financial crisis,” the bank said in its press release.

Ralph Hamers agreed to step down, effective Wednesday, to facilitate the change.

“Integrating Credit Suisse successfully is the most important task for UBS,” he told shareholders. “I am confident that the new CEO Sergio Ermotti, with his outstanding record and experience, will lead the firm safely through this next phase.”

Colm Kelleher, chairman of the UBS board of directors, also spoke Wednesday, acknowledging the Credit Suisse acquisition is not expected to halt other growth initiatives underway for the bank.

“Equally, risk management and control, including operational resilience, conduct, and prevention of financial crime, remain key focus areas of the board of directors,” he said.

At Credit Suisse’s annual meeting Tuesday, Board Chairman Axel Lehmann apologized to shareholders regarding’s the bank’s swift downfall, saying he and the rest of its leadership did the best they could to avert collapse.

“The period from October to March was not long enough,” he said. “One legacy issue after another had already seen trust eroded—and with it, patience dwindled. At that, we failed. It was too late. The bitter reality is that there wasn’t enough time for our strategy to bear fruit.”",['Kyle Brasseur'],

https://www.businessinsider.com/best-stock-picks-investing-high-upside-dividend-growth-profit-ubs-2023-4,UBS: Buy these 30 stocks to profit from their market-beating combination of upside and outsize dividend growth,"UBS Strategist Keith Parker says high-dividend stocks usually beat the market during tough times.

Parker suggests investing in stocks that pay good dividends and can repeatedly raise those payments.

He made a list of high-upside stocks that have the room for sustained dividend growth through 2025.

As the economy slows and stocks react to turmoil in the banking system, investors have looked for safer and less volatile ways to put their money to work. Dividend-paying stocks have emerged as a popular choice.

Few professionals would tell investors to just buy the biggest dividend payers there are and leave it at that. It's too simplistic a tip, and it's arguably a risky one. Just because a stock pays a big dividend today doesn't mean that it always will, and it doesn't guarantee price returns either.

Many experts and strategists tell investors to look for companies with strong free cash flow and a history of dividend growth, as those companies are more likely to maintain their dividends and to raise them over time.

UBS Chief US Equity Strategist Keith Parker recommended a version of that approach in a recent note to clients.

""Dividend stocks can provide a margin of safety during uncertain times. Dividend stocks outperformed the market by 4.5% during the 2001, 2008, 2020 recessions,"" Parker wrote.

Instead of focusing on the biggest dividend payers of today, Parker look for companies that pay dividend at higher rates than the median S&P 500 company (1.7%), and where UBS' analysts think the companies will have far above-average rates of dividend increases over the next few years — with projected dividend growth rates of 5% to over 20%.

He also focused on companies with the potential for significant price appreciation. Parker thinks the following 30 companies could gain anywhere from 9% to 80% in price appreciation over the next year, all while paying substantial dividends over that time, with potentially even bigger payments to follow in the years ahead.

https://seekingalpha.com/news/3954726-automakers-likely-driving-toward-overproduction-ubs,Automakers likely driving toward overproduction - UBS (NASDAQ:TSLA),"An analysis by UBS indicates that automakers could be headed for overproduction amid normalizing supply chains, reversing the trends that caused prices to soar in recent years.

The analysis offered by a team of analysts led by Patrick Hummel pointed to global production reaching 85.8M units in 2023, overshooting the team’s sales forecast of 81M units. As such, inventories are expected to exceed pre-pandemic volumes for the first time as demand slows and production bottlenecks are alleviated.

“OEMs argue with pent-up demand, but that expectation is not supported by latest macro trends. Given the bullish production schedules, we see high risk of overproduction and growing pricing pressure as a result,” the team told clients. “The price war has already started unfolding in the EV space, and we expect it to spread into the combustion engine segment in H2.”

That said, Hummel’s team expects luxury automakers to remain resilient, with Porsche AG (OTCPK:DRPRF) and Mercedes (OTCPK:MBGAF) recommended as Buy-rated names. The two were named “most preferred OEMs, next to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA),” by the team. Stellantis (STLA) -2.28% was cited as the only Buy-rated western mass OEM.

Major US automakers Ford (F) -2.67%, Tesla (TSLA) -4.12% and General Motors (GM) -2.99% declined sharply on Wednesday, joined by major Chinese EV manufacturers Nio (NIO) -3.47%, BYD Company (OTCPK:BYDDY) -1.97%, and Li Auto (LI) -2.33%. XPeng (XPEV) -0.88% marked a comparatively modest decline.

Other notable decliners on the day included Faraday Future Intelligent Electric (FFIE) -6.64%, Fisker (FSR) -4.15%, Lucid Group (LCID) -4.24%, Lordstown Motors (RIDE) -6.52%, Polestar (PSNY) -7.65%, Canoo (GOEV) -7.45%, Rivian Automotive (RIVN) -5.1%, Mullen Automotive (MULN) -2.1%, and Fisker (FSR) -4.57%.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann on Tuesday told shareholders he was ""truly sorry"" for the collapse that led to the bank's controversial takeover by UBS . ""It is a sad day for you and for us too. I can understand the bitterness, the anger and the shock of all those who are disappointed, overwhelmed and affected by the developments,"" Lehmann said at the bank's annual meeting, the first time its leaders have addressed the public since the rescue. ""I apologize that we were no longer able to stem the loss of trust that had accumulated over the years, and for disappointing you."" A police presence was established early Tuesday at the venue, as protesters and shareholders began arriving in droves, hoping for answers and accountability following the demise of the 167-year-old Swiss institution. A number of shareholders took to the stage over the course of the morning to lambast the bank's leadership and demand further explanation of the process and reasoning behind the deal. Swiss authorities brokered an emergency rescue of the stricken bank by its larger domestic rival for just 3 billion Swiss francs, over the course of a weekend in late March. It followed a collapse in Credit Suisse's deposits and share price amid fears of a global banking crisis, but the deal remains mired in legal and logistical challenges. Neither UBS nor Credit Suisse shareholders were allowed a vote on the deal.

""Until the end, we fought hard to find a solution, but ultimately there were only two options: deal or bankruptcy,"" Lehmann, who became chairman in January 2022, told shareholders. ""The merger had to go through."" At 2 p.m. London time, Lehmann was re-elected as chairman until the completion of the merger, winning 55.67% of shareholder votes. The remaining board members were narrowly re-elected, with the exception of five that did not stand again. In a statement Sunday, the office of the attorney general confirmed that Switzerland's Federal Prosecutor is investigating potential breaches of Swiss federal law by government officials, regulators and top executives at Credit Suisse and UBS. Both banks declined to comment on Monday. 'We ran out of time' Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Koerner took over in 2021, when the bank was reeling from a series of high-profile scandals, risk management failures and heavy losses. In October 2022, Credit Suisse launched a massive strategic overhaul, aimed at fixing its risk and compliance culture and addressing perennial underperformance in the investment bank. Koerner told shareholders on Tuesday that he returned to Credit Suisse in 2021 hoping to ""tackle the problems that existed and build a new Credit Suisse."" ""In short, I wanted to create an organization that our shareholders, our clients and all our employees could be proud of. Unfortunately, we didn't succeed in the end. We ran out of time. This fills me with sorrow,"" he said. ""What has happened over the past few weeks will continue to affect me personally and many others for a long time to come.""

Commentators have highlighted the importance of the deal's success for Swiss authorities against a febrile political backdrop. The lack of input from shareholders, bondholders and Swiss taxpayers in UBS' acquisition of its embattled rival has sparked widespread anger. Speaking outside the annual meeting, Vincent Kaufmann, CEO of Ethos Foundation which represents pension funds comprising between 3% and 5% of Credit Suisse shareholders, told CNBC that they had ""lost a lot of money"" and ""need to know what management is doing."" Potential courses of action include ""trying to retrieve some of the viable pay that was granted for former management, who may have failed in their duties to protect shareholders' interests,"" he said. ""We're still looking for possibilities — it's quite difficult with the Swiss company law to prove the damage. Mismanagement of a company is not per se something we can concretely act against former members of the management or current members of the management, but still we need to be sure that they gave the whole truth to investors and to the market, so there is still open question,"" Kaufmann told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche. Holders of Credit Suisse's AT1 bond instruments, which were subject to a $17 billion wipeout as part of the UBS takeover, last week instructed a global law firm to pursue discussion and possible litigation with Swiss authorities.

Further, at the current price of $20 per share, it is 13% below its fair value of $23 – Trefis’ estimate for UBS’s valuation. The bank agreed to acquire Credit Suisse earlier this month for $3.2 billion. Notably, the deal was pushed by Swiss regulators to bail out Credit Suisse from its difficult liquidity position. While details about the integration are yet to be officially disclosed, it is likely to take 3-4 years.

The Swiss bank posted better-than-expected profits in the fourth quarter of 2022, despite an 8% drop in total revenues to $8.03 billion. The top line suffered due to a 24% decrease in investment bank revenues, followed by a 31% decline in asset management, and a 5% drop in the global wealth management divisions. That said, the personal & corporate banking revenues grew 5% y-o-y driven by higher net interest income. Further, the noninterest expenses decreased 13% y-o-y, leading to an adjusted net income of $1.65 billion – up 23% y-o-y.

UBS’s net revenues marginally decreased to $34.56 billion in FY2022. It was driven by a 2% decrease in wealth management and an 8% drop in the investment bank units, almost offset by a 13% increase in asset management and a 1% rise in personal & corporate banking revenues. On the cost front, the operating expenses were reduced by 4% y-o-y, improving the adjusted net income by 2% y-o-y to $7.63 billion.

Moving forward, we forecast UBS’ revenues to remain around $35.23 billion in FY2023. Additionally, UBS’ adjusted net income margin is likely to remain around the same level as the previous year. It will likely result in an annual GAAP EPS of $2.32, which coupled with a P/E multiple of just below 10x will lead to a valuation of $23.

https://www.fstech.co.uk/fst/Swiss_Parliament_Emergency_Meeting.php,Swiss parliament to hold emergency meeting over Credit Suisse-UBS merger,"The Swiss Parliament will hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday to discuss the collapse of Credit Suisse and the government’s subsequent response.



The government has come under fire from both pundits and opposition parliamentarians for facilitating the shotgun $3.3 billion takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS with over 250 billion Swiss Francs in guarantees and support.



The emergency meeting is only the third of its kind held by the Swiss parliament over the past 20 years. It will provide parliament with a chance to reject the loans given as part of the rescue package, though this is largely a symbolic vote as the state has already committed the funds.



The main point of contention for lawmakers was that the huge financial commitment was made by a sub-group of six MPs – leaving almost 250 without a say on the matter.



Lawmakers will also discuss whether conditions can be imposed on Credit Suisse, with the country’s Federal Council already telling the bank to either cut or reduce bonus payments to upper levels of management.



The mounting anger in Switzerland over how the government has handled this situation is reflected by a study from political research firm gfs.bern which found that a majority of the population do not support the deal.

https://www.ibtimes.com/ubs-shareholders-weigh-credit-suisse-mega-merger-3683400,UBS Shareholders To Weigh In On Credit Suisse Mega-merger,"UBS shareholders get their first chance to grill the bank's bosses Wednesday over its shotgun marriage to Credit Suisse, done in double-quick time behind their backs.

Switzerland's biggest bank is absorbing its stricken closest domestic rival in a deal stitched together on March 19 out of fears of a global banking crisis if the floundering Credit Suisse went under.

But some UBS shareholders may have concerns closer to home as to what it means for their personal investments now the bank is taking on an institution that repeatedly got itself into trouble.

Shareholders of both banks had no say in the mega-merger, which was engineered behind closed doors by the Swiss government, the central bank and the financial regulators.

Wednesday's annual general meeting takes place in Basel, one of the two birthplaces of UBS along with Zurich.

The AGM is being held in the St. Jakobshalle indoor arena, famously the stomping ground of Swiss tennis great Roger Federer -- Credit Suisse's top brand ambassador.

The meeting will see Dutch chief executive Ralph Hamers bow out. Once the AGM is over, Sergio Ermotti returns as CEO, having been called back to UBS to handle the delicate integration process.

The 62-year-old Swiss banker ran UBS between 2011 and 2020, having been brought in to restructure and stabilise the bank after its state bailout during the 2008 global financial crisis, followed by the 2011 losses of a rogue trader who blew $2.3 billion.

UBS chairman Colm Kelleher said he felt Ermotti would be the ""better pilot"" for the bank's new flight path than the digital transformation-focused Hamers, who will stay on for a handover period.

UBS will become a banking colossus, with $5 trillion of invested assets.

Kelleher has voiced his concerns about not only the execution risks in carrying out the merger but also about the dangers of ""bad culture"" from Credit Suisse, primarily in its investment banking, bleeding into UBS.

There are also the numerous disputes accumulated by Credit Suisse that UBS will have to settle, after having already spent several years settling its own.

Roger Said, director of the Swiss shareholder organisation Actares, said that Ermotti ""will have to put an end to the irresponsible risk culture that has existed for years at Credit Suisse, as well as drastically reduce risky business sectors"".

The annual general meeting comes the day after Credit Suisse held its final AGM before the 167-year-old bank is swallowed up by UBS.

Credit Suisse chairman Axel Lehmann said he was ""truly sorry"" that the national institution could not be saved as he faced angry and tearful shareholders whose money has gone up in smoke.

He said that ""ultimately there were only two options: deal or bankruptcy"".

UBS shares closed up 0.2 percent Tuesday at 18.77 Swiss francs each, while the Swiss stock exchange dropped 0.2 percent.

Credit Suisse shareholders have seen the value of their investment plunge from 12.78 Swiss francs per share in February 2021 to the 0.76 francs they will receive in the $3.25-billion merger.

The Ethos foundation, which represents pension funds in Switzerland and owns stakes in both banks, said Credit Suisse shareholders were mobilising to get UBS to think about giving them more than 0.76 francs per share.

© Denis Linine | Dreamstime.com

When UBS chairman Colm Kelleher joined UBS in 2022 he inherited a plan put together by the bank’s former chairman as early as 2020 on how Credit Suisse could be taken over. Kelleher built on the plan with help from a small group of bankers from Morgan Stanley, his former employer.

According to Bloomberg the project was top secret and few at Morgan Stanley knew what their senior mergers and financial services colleagues were working on with a tight circle of UBS executives. But their efforts meant that when Credit Suisse depositors started rushing to withdraw their money in mid-March, UBS was ready to go.

On 15 March 2023, when the Swiss National Bank (SNB) provided Credit Suisse with a CHF 50 billion lifeline and the Swiss government (Federal Council) encouraged the two banks to merge, UBS quickly turned from planning to execution.

By the end of the following weekend, CHF 16 billion of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds had been written to zero and UBS had acquired a company with a book value of CHF 61 billion1 for CHF 3 billion. The deal left Credit Suisse shareholders with around 5 cents for every franc of book value.

On 4 April 2023, the management of Credit Suisse faced angry shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting. Credit Suisse chairman Axel Lehmann’s apology for the bank’s rapid demise and fire sale proved sufficient for him to remain in the job by a thin margin – 55.67% of votes supported his remaining, reported RTS.

https://www.finews.com/news/english-news/56752-result-extraordiary-session-national-council,Outrage Over UBS Deal Finds a Majority in the Swiss National Council,"During yesterday's special session, the Council of States lived up to its reputation as the more moderate of the two Swiss parliamentary chambers. Emotions in the National Council ran high during the evening, with a clear majority voting against the government's motions.

The National Council's rebuff of the federal government's guarantees of 109 billion Swiss francs for the merger of UBS and Credit Suisse mainly resulted in prolonging the debate, at least for the time being. Now the reconciliation process begins to amend the bill so it is palatable for both chambers and can be submitted for approval. If the process is unsuccessful, the bill will fail.

Still, a rejection of the bill wouldn't have any consequences for the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, because the commitments made by the federal government through emergency legislation are legally binding.

Opposition from the Wings

The rejection in the National Council was a foregone conclusion. The SVP, SP, and the Greens had already spoken out against the motion in advance, each setting their conditions to be met for approval.

Some of the demands were formulated in review motions. These included a review of the Banking Act, an examination of the possible culpability of former and active managers of Credit Suisse, and an investigation into the practical applicability, effectiveness, and meaningfulness of the too-big-to-fail rules. The conservative SVP pushed through a demand for measures to ensure competition despite the merger, although motions calling for a discussion on binding proposals did not pass.

A Clear Rejection

The results came shortly before midnight when the vote for supplementary credit was rejected by a vote of 102 votes to 71 with 2 abstentions. The framework conditions for the use of the funds were also rejected by a similar ratio of votes.

In the afternoon session, the Council of States approved both the credits and the framework conditions.

René Brunner becomes the new CEO on July 1, having learned the investment advisory and asset management trade from scratch and gained 35 years of professional experience, according to Valterna, which previously was Asset Management Partners.

https://nypost.com/2023/03/21/ubs-credit-suisse-takeover-could-layoff-tens-of-thousands/,Credit Suisse rescue reportedly could spur ‘tens of thousands’ of layoffs,"UBS Group’s emergency bailout of struggling lender Credit Suisse reportedly could result in “tens of thousands” of layoffs — and worried bankers are already said to be scrambling to contact recruiters.

The culling is expected to hit hardest at Credit Suisse’s operations in Switzerland and its investment bank, the Financial Times reported, citing sources familiar with UBS’s plans for the firm.

The report said the amount of lost jobs could be “as much as a third” of the 120,000 people employed at the combined operations of Credit Suisse and UBS.

“The takeover threatens job cuts on a scale that the labor market in the banking sector cannot absorb,” the Swiss Bank Employees’ Association said in a Tuesday statement, according to the outlet.

Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Korner and chair Alex Lehmann told staffers that no decisions have yet been made about potential layoffs.

Separately, a source told Bloomberg that the layoffs could amount to “multiples” of Credit Suisse’s current plan to slash 9,000 jobs, which was already in place before UBS took over the troubled lender.

Rumored layoffs have prompted an “unprecedented flood” of calls from Credit Suisse bankers to corporate headhunters and other firms as they look to secure new gigs ahead of the upheaval, Bloomberg reported, citing interviews with people at more than a dozen firms based in New York, London, Singapore and other cities.

One firm in Singapore told Bloomberg it had received calls from approximately 30 private bankers, mostly employed by Credit Suisse, on Monday alone.

A recruiter based in Hong Kong said they had fielded calls from more than 20 senior investment bankers over the last week, while another headquartered in London said inquiries were coming in “all weekend.”

“The best ones at Credit Suisse have probably already left,” Singapore-based recruiter Will Tan of Principal Partners told the outlet.

“There’s definitely not enough to go around for everyone,” Tan added.

UBS described its deal to buy Credit Suisse as an “emergency rescue.” REUTERS

Any ousted workers could face a difficult path to finding another job, given the current turmoil in the US banking system and abroad. Some banks, such as Goldman Sachs, have already conducted layoffs within the last few months.

Shares of Credit Suisse have cratered since last week, when top brass disclosed that they had discovered “material weaknesses” in the firm’s financial reporting over the last two years.

UBS’s government-brokered emergency rescue did little to assuage concerns, as Credit Suisse’s stock cratered by some 55% in the first day of trading after the announcement. UBS shares pared early losses and ended 1.2% higher on Monday.

The admission prompted a crisis of confidence among investors and raised fears of a collapse that could spread further contagion in a banking sector already rocked by the implosions of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank of New York.

“We are encouraging colleagues to continue to the best of their abilities against a difficult backdrop,” a Singapore-based Credit Suisse spokesperson told Bloomberg.

“Ultimately, we will do everything we can to ensure an orderly transition and to serve our clients as best as possible,” the spokesperson added.

UBS reportedly referred to its Sunday statement on the deal when asked for comment about the job situation.

“This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue,” UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said in the statement.

“We have structured a transaction which will preserve the value left in the business while limiting our downside exposure,” Kelleher added.

Show Caption Hide Caption Swiss bank UBS takes over ailing Credit Suisse Banking giant UBS is buying its smaller rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion, in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in global banking. AP

Banking giant UBS is buying its smaller rival Credit Suisse for $3.2 billion in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in global banking, Swiss President Alain Berset announced on Sunday night.

Berset called the announcement ""one of great breadth for the stability of international finance. An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.""

The Swiss Federal Council, a seven-member governing body that includes Berset, said in a press release Sunday that it was providing a guarantee of liquidity from the Swiss National Bank to Credit Suisse.

""The Federal Council is taking this measure in order to protect financial stability and the Swiss economy,"" it the council// said.

The Swiss government said it would provide more than $9 billion ""in order to reduce any risks for UBS"" and ""potential losses arising from certain assets that UBS takes over as part of the transaction.""

Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world's globally systemic important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

SVB: Close to 190 banks could face Silicon Valley Bank's fate, according to a new study

'Wake-up call': Advocacy groups, lawmakers highlight law they say led to SVB collapse

Sunday's news conference follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further bank panics. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse's share price began plummeting this week.

Berset said the council had agreed to guarantee a total of 150 billion francs ($162 billion) of liquidity to Credit Suisse, well beyond the 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) figure that had been announced publicly. But that didn’t appear to be enough.

“We noted that the outflows of liquidity and the volatility of the markets demonstrated that necessary confidence could no longer be restored, and a rapid solution guaranteeing stability was essential.”

Still, many of Credit Suisse's problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.

The deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn't invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.

On Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.

Its current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified ""material weaknesses"" in the bank's internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.

While smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.

Despite the banking turmoil, the European Central Bank on Thursday approved a large, half-percentage point increase in interest rates to try to curb stubbornly high inflation, saying Europe's banking sector is ""resilient,"" with strong finances.

ECB President Christine Lagarde said the banks ""are in a completely different position from 2008"" during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.

The Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/19/business/credit-suisse-ubs-rescue/index.html,UBS is buying Credit Suisse in bid to halt banking crisis,"London CNN —

Switzerland’s biggest bank, UBS, has agreed to buy its ailing rival Credit Suisse in an emergency rescue deal aimed at stemming financial market panic unleashed by the failure of two American banks earlier this month.

“UBS today announced the takeover of Credit Suisse,” the Swiss National Bank said in a statement Sunday. It said the rescue would “secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy.”

UBS is paying 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion) for Credit Suisse, about 60% less than the bank was worth when markets closed on Friday. Credit Suisse shareholders will be largely wiped out, receiving the equivalent of just 0.76 Swiss francs in UBS shares for stock that was worth 1.86 Swiss francs on Friday. Owners of $17 billion worth of “additional tier one” bonds — a riskier class of bank debt — will lose everything, Swiss regulators said.

Extraordinarily, the deal will not need the approval of shareholders after the Swiss government agreed to change the law to remove any uncertainty about the deal.

Credit Suisse (CS) had been losing the trust of investors and customers for years. In 2022, it recorded its worst loss since the global financial crisis. But confidence collapsed last week after it acknowledged “material weakness” in its bookkeeping and as the demise of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank spread fear about weaker institutions at a time when soaring interest rates have undermined the value of some financial assets.

Shares in the 167-year-old bank fell 25% over the week, money poured from investment funds it manages and at one point account holders were withdrawing deposits of more than $10 billion per day, the Financial Times reported. An emergency loan of nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank failed to stop the bleeding.

But it did “build a bridge” to the weekend, to allow the rescue to be pieced together, Swiss officials said Sunday night.

“This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue,” UBS chairman Colm Kelleher told reporters.

“It is absolutely essential to the financial structure of Switzerland and … to global finance,” he told reporters.

Desperate to prevent the meltdown spreading through the global financial system on Monday, Swiss authorities initiated the search for a private sector solution, with limited state support, while reportedly considering Plan B — a full or partial nationalization.

“Given recent extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances, the announced merger represents the best available outcome,” Credit Suisse chairman Axel Lehmann said in a statement.

“This has been an extremely challenging time for Credit Suisse and while the team has worked tirelessly to address many significant legacy issues and execute on its new strategy, we are forced to reach a solution today that provides a durable outcome.”

The emergency takeover was agreed to after a days of frantic negotiations involving financial regulators in Switzerland, the United States and United Kingdom. UBS (UBS) and Credit Suisse rank among the 30 most important banks in the global financial system, and together they have almost $1.7 trillion in assets.

Regulators applaud the takeover

Financial market regulators around the world cheered UBS’ action to take over Credit Suisse.

US authorities said they supported the action and worked closely with the Swiss central bank to assist the takeover.

“We welcome the announcements by the Swiss authorities today to support financial stability,” said US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a joint statement. “The capital and liquidity positions of the US. banking system are strong, and the US financial system is resilient.”

Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, said the banking sector remains resilient but the ECB stands at the ready to help banks maintain enough cash on hand to fund their operations if the need arises.

“I welcome the swift action and the decisions taken by the Swiss authorities,” Lagarde said. “They are instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.

The Bank of England said it welcomed the measures taken by the Swiss authorities “to support financial stability.”

“We have been engaging closely with international counterparts throughout the preparations for today’s announcements and will continue to support their implementation,” it said in a statement. “The UK banking system is well capitalized and funded, and remains safe and sound.”

How UBS and Credit Suisse will fit together

The global headquarters of UBS and Credit Suisse are just 300 yards apart in Zurich but the banks’ fortunes have been on very different paths recently. Shares of UBS have climbed 15% in the past two years, and it booked a profit of $7.6 billion in 2022. It had a stock market value of about $65 billion on Friday, according to Refinitiv.

Credit Suisse shares have lost 84% of their value over the same period, and last year it posted a loss of $7.9 billion. It was worth just $8 billion at the end of last week.

Dating back to 1856, Credit Suisse has its roots in the Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (SKA), which was set up to finance the expansion of the railroad network and industrialization of Switzerland.

In addition to being Switzerland’s second biggest bank, it looks after the wealth of many of the world’s richest people and offers global investment banking services. It had more than 50,000 employees at the end of 2022, 17,000 of those in Switzerland.

The Swiss National Bank said it would provide a loan of 100 billion Swiss francs ($108 billion) to UBS and Credit Suisse to boost liquidity.

UBS Chief Executive Ralph Hamers will be CEO of the combined bank, and Kelleher will serve as chairman.

The takeover will reinforce the position of UBS as the world’s leading wealth manager with $5 trillion of invested assets, and boost its ambition to grow in the Americas and Asia. UBS said it expects to generate cost savings of $8 billion per year by 2027. Credit Suisse’s investment bank is in the crosshairs.

GENEVA -- UBS said Wednesday that it's bringing back former CEO Sergio Ermotti to lead the Swiss bank as it executes a government-orchestrated plan to take over struggling rival Credit Suisse.

Ermotti, who was the bank's top executive for nine years and led a turnaround following the 2008 global financial crisis, will take over next Wednesday from CEO Ralph Hamers.

Hamers took up the job in November 2020 and will remain at UBS during a transition period “to ensure a successful closure of the transaction and a smooth handover,” the bank said in a statement.

“Whilst Ralph was capable of doing the job, we felt that Sergio was better suited to navigating these things,” Chairman Colm Kelleher said on a conference call, alluding to the UBS board decision. “I cannot reemphasize how big this deal is in terms of financial history and financial engineering that’s required.”

UBS credited Ermotti, who is now chairman of insurer Swiss Re, for having “cut its footprint” and changing the culture of the bank — and it pointed to his experience in bringing big financial institutions together.

Ermotti, who hails from the southern, mostly Italian-speaking Swiss region of Ticino, acknowledged that “coming back to manage this situation is a challenge” but felt “a sense of call-of-duty aspect” to return.

Plus, he said he had contemplated a tie-up like the one with Credit Suisse while previously in the top job, and it would be a bit of a ”contradiction"" for him not to accept the post ""to basically execute on what I believe was the right next move for UBS.”

Kelleher said he called Ermotti “to explore the possibility of this” a day after the emergency takeover deal was settled on March 19, which involved Swiss regulators, the federal government and top executives at both banks.

“This is is the biggest single financial transaction since 2008. That brings significant execution risk,” Kelleher said.

The hastily arranged, $3.25 billion deal for Credit Suisse aimed to stem the upheaval in the global financial system after the collapse of two U.S. banks and jitters about long-running troubles at Credit Suisse led shares of Switzerland’s second-largest bank to tank and customers to pull out their money.

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after the central bank’s plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and customers. The Swiss executive branch passed emergency measures to bypass shareholder approval.

Uncertainties still lie ahead, including a U.S. Senate committee report released Wednesday that says Credit Suisse violated a plea agreement with U.S. authorities by failing to report secret offshore accounts that wealthy Americans used to avoid paying taxes.

UBS said it assessed outstanding lawsuits and investigations as part of the Credit Suisse acquisition and expects the deal to be beneficial for shareholders. It says it's working to close the sale and get approval from regulators in the coming weeks or months.

Hamers, the outgoing CEO, said UBS executives want to ensure “a digestible transaction” in terms of risk. He said there were plans to “manage down the investment bank” at Credit Suisse because many of the activities were not central for UBS.

UBS leaders announced no immediate plan about job cuts linked to the deal.

Swiss lawmakers and academics have raised concerns that the deal could create an unwieldy Swiss banking behemoth, while UBS executives said regulatory issues loom internationally before the deal can close.

Ermotti suggested he didn't view “too big too fail” concerns as a problem.

“I do think that scale and size is not a problem if it is focused and well-managed,” he said. “For me, the debate nowadays is not ‘too big to fail' but ‘too small to survive’ — and we want to be a winner.”

Many Credit Suisse customers have expressed regret at the looming disappearance of a 167-year-old bank that has been a pillar of Switzerland's renowned banking and financial industry.

Ermotti, who was CEO of the bank from 2011 to 2020, is credited with helping UBS recover from the massive losses it incurred during the 2008 financial crisis.

UBS said that Hamers, who has been CEO since November 2020, “has agreed to step down to serve the interests of the new combination, the Swiss financial sector and the country.”

The bank said it made the move “in light of the new challenges and priorities” following its government-brokered emergency rescue of Credit Suisse.

Swiss authorities engineered the merger in hopes of preventing a wider banking crisis.

Fears of contagion were stoked by the collapse of US-based lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank of New York.

JPMorgan Chase and 10 of the largest lenders in the country banded together to provide a $30 billion infusion of capital to help troubled San Francisco-based First Republic Bank.

Summary Companies Buying back at issue price

Issued on March 9

Follows takeover of Credit Suisse















March 22 (Reuters) - UBS Group (UBSG.S) said on Wednesday it would buy back 2.75 billion euros ($2.96 billion) worth of debt it sold just days ago in a bid to boost confidence among bondholders rattled by its $3 billion rescue of rival Credit Suisse.

UBS' takeover saw holders of Credit Suisse's Additional Tier 1 bonds getting written down to zero while shareholders will receive some UBS stock, an unusual move that sees stock owners benefiting from better terms.

UBS is buying back its own bonds at the price at which they were sold on March 9 prior to the Credit Suisse deal rather than at market prices, compensating investors after a sell-off this week.

""They're trying to be friendly to investors who purchased just before the mess,"" said Jerome Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments, a fund which owned Credit Suisse AT1 bonds.

UBS in a statement said it was buying back a 1.5 billion-euro 4.625% fixed-rate note due March 2028 and a 1.25 billion-euro 4.750% fixed rate note due March 2032.

The notes are loss-absorbing senior unsecured bail-in notes.

Credit rating agency S&P revised its outlook on the holding company of UBS, the issuer of the bonds, to negative from stable on Monday, reflecting pressure on creditworthiness linked to the Credit Suisse deal.

Moody's cut its ratings outlook across UBS' entities to negative, while Fitch placed them on ""watch negative"".

UBS shares and bonds have seesawed this week as investors assess the impact of the Credit Suisse deal.

On Monday the shares fell by as much as 17% only to close 35% higher than those lows on Tuesday. UBS bonds also tumbled, with its AT1 debt taking a big hit in particular on Monday.

Credit Suisse AT1 bondholders weren't compensated, which the bank's AT1 prospectus spelled out could happen in Switzerland, but markets were still surprised, being used to seeing bondholders rank higher than equity holders who are to receive the value of the share offer.

The prices of the bonds UBS is buying back on Wednesday had also tumbled but partially recovered on Tuesday. ,

They rallied further following Wednesday's announcement. The price of the March 2032 bond was up just under a point on the day as prices on both bonds rose near to the levels UBS is offering to pay bondholders, Tradeweb data showed.

""The issuer has decided to launch this exercise as a result of a prudent assessment of these recent developments and the issuer's long-term commitment to its credit investors,"" UBS said in its statement.

UBS buyback bonds

The buyback was ""fair"" given the market volatility since the bonds were sold, a banker involved with the sale of the bonds said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

UBS shares closed down 3.7% at 18.71 Swiss francs ($21.05), having risen as much as 3.6% earlier.

https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/ubs-salvages-most-value-credit-suisse-wreck-2023-03-19/,UBS salvages most value from Credit Suisse wreck,"













NEW YORK, March 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - UBS (UBSG.S) Chair Colm Kelleher is buying Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) because he has to, not because he wants to. The 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.2 billion) rescue deal, brokered by Swiss authorities and announced late on Sunday, is designed to shore up confidence in the country’s financial industry rather than benefit the buyer. Even so, UBS is salvaging the most value from the wreckage.

The Swiss government, central bank and regulator FINMA concluded that a UBS takeover was better than letting Credit Suisse fail, which could have sparked a wider banking-sector panic. The job for Kelleher was how to avoid infecting UBS with its arch-rival’s problems.

He’s secured some handy protections. The all-share offer values Credit Suisse at 60% less than its closing share price on Friday, and at a fraction of its 45 billion Swiss franc book value at the end of last year. FINMA will also let UBS write off its target’s debt instruments, known as Additional Tier 1 (AT1) securities, boosting the combined group’s equity capital by about 16 billion Swiss francs. Meanwhile the government will cover up to 9 billion Swiss francs of losses, such as markdowns on Credit Suisse assets, past a certain threshold.

Thanks to a competition waiver, Kelleher can even keep Credit Suisse’s domestic unit, giving UBS a dominant position in local retail and corporate banking and allowing it to extract hefty cost savings. Chief Executive Ralph Hamers reckons the bank can cut about $8 billion of annual expenses by 2027. After deducting tax at 24% and capitalising using a 10% discount rate, those savings have a net present value of about $60 billion - roughly in line with UBS’s market value before the deal.

Yet it’s a sign of Credit Suisse’s predicament that the deal is far from a home run. On a call with analysts late on Sunday, UBS executives stumbled over some of the numbers – perhaps unsurprising for a transaction negotiated over a weekend. Wealthy customers who have money stashed with both banks could move some of it to spread their risk, while UBS might have to ditch some of Credit Suisse’s dicier clients. Hamers and his team will have to rapidly shrink their new acquisition’s investment banking arm, a tricky task even in less jittery markets.

Longer term, Swiss authorities have concentrated more of the country’s financial risk in a bigger juggernaut. That means even more regulatory and political scrutiny. FINMA’s decision to write off Credit Suisse’s AT1 securities just four days after it declared the bank was meeting all its capital and liquidity requirements will only increase the alarm felt by investors in other European lenders.

A UBS takeover is preferable to the Swiss government nationalising Credit Suisse or winding it down. And Kelleher has improved the chances of the rewards outweighing the risks. Whether it’s enough to soothe the wider financial sector is less clear.

CONTEXT NEWS

UBS will rescue Credit Suisse in a deal worth about 3 billion Swiss francs, Swiss authorities and the two banks said on March 19.

Shareholders in Credit Suisse will get one new UBS share for every 22.48 shares they currently hold. Based on UBS’s closing price on March 17 the offer values Credit Suisse shares at 0.76 Swiss francs each, well below the last closing price of 1.86 Swiss francs.

Credit Suisse’s 16 billion Swiss francs of Additional Tier 1 securities will be written off to zero, boosting the combined group’s regulatory capital.

The Swiss government will also grant UBS a 9 billion Swiss franc guarantee against losses arising from certain assets that it will get as part of the deal. The guarantee kicks in if losses exceed a threshold, which the finance ministry did not quantify.

The Swiss National Bank will offer up to 100 billion Swiss francs of liquidity support to UBS and Credit Suisse, plus a further 100 billion Swiss francs to the smaller bank backed by a federal guarantee.

UBS estimates that the combined group could reduce its annual costs by roughly $8 billion.

https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/03/22/ubs-acquisition-credit-suisse-pay-off-shareholders/,Will UBS' Acquisition of Credit Suisse Pay Off for Shareholders?,"In a deal heavily pushed by Swiss and global banking regulators, the large Swiss bank UBS (UBS 1.69%) recently announced that it will acquire the embattled Credit Suisse (CS 3.26%) in an all-stock transaction valued at roughly $3.24 billion.

Credit Suisse has struggled immensely for the last several years and had hoped to transform itself. But given more struggles last week, significant turbulence in the banking sector, and a threat to Switzerland's economy (and perhaps Europe's as well if the bank went under), global banking regulators pushed a deal through over the weekend.

The credit rating agency S&P Global cut UBS' outlook to ""negative"" upon the announcement of the deal, citing ""material execution risk in integrating CS into UBS."" Will this deal be problematic or pay off for shareholders? Let's take a look.

Downside risk protection

The big problem that has surrounded Credit Suisse for years is the firm's investment bank, which clearly has struggled to implement proper risk management protocols. Credit Suisse has racked up billions in losses after certain businesses in the investment bank had outsize exposure to funds like Greensill Capital and Archegos Capital, which both collapsed.

Prior to UBS' acquisition, Credit Suisse had planned to break up its investment bank into three different pieces, one of which was meant to shelter riskier assets. So the biggest risk UBS faces is winding down Credit Suisse's trading business. This deal was obviously pushed through very quickly, given the potential risk of Credit Suisse collapsing, so UBS clearly hasn't had the time to do proper due diligence and there could be other unsavory surprises lurking.

The good news is that UBS secured significant downside protection from Swiss banking regulators of close to $27 billion, which will be used to cover charges, purchase price adjustments, and restructuring costs. Notably -- and quite controversially, I might add -- about $17 billion of this amount will be used to write off additional Tier 1 bank debt, which bondholders were not pleased with given they are supposed to get paid before owners of common stock. Swiss regulators will also provide roughly $9.7 billion of protection against losses in Credit Suisse's investment bank beyond the first $5.4 billion of losses, which UBS will cover.

Enhancing the UBS franchise

Aside from the downside protection, UBS is also acquiring some very good businesses from Credit Suisse, which will help the bank add scale and improve its existing operations.

Credit Suisse's asset and wealth management division has $1 trillion in client assets and brings UBS' total client assets to $5 trillion, putting the latter well on its way toward its $6 trillion goal laid out at its investor day a year ago. UBS will become the second-largest player in global wealth management and the No. 3 ranked asset manager in Europe. These businesses, which are very attractive these days due to the fact that they are less capital intensive, thrive off of scale, and shareholders tend to reward them with higher valuations, too.

UBS will also get Credit Suisse's domestic banking unit, making it the No. 1 corporate and personal bank in Switzerland, with the largest amount of deposits and loans. Bank of America analyst Alastair Ryan wrote in a research note that the pro forma institution will control a roughly 30% market share of Swiss domestic deposits. In 2022, Credit Suisse's Swiss bank reported an 11.8% return on capital, while the asset and wealth management businesses are also capable of putting up strong returns, especially with the enhanced scale at UBS.

The potential to be a great deal

Because the deal was orchestrated so quickly, there is of course execution risk and the possibility that UBS runs into obstacles as it winds down Credit Suisse's investment bank.

But UBS got a great deal. Last week, Credit Suisse was valued at about $8 billion while trading at all-time lows. UBS scooped the bank up for $3.24 billion while securing significant downside protection. The deal also increases UBS' tangible book value per share by a whopping 74%. Bank stocks trade relative to their tangible book value per share, so increasing it tends to be beneficial in the long term.

In the process, UBS is also making some nice additions to several of its businesses, as well as removing a competitor, and now has an undeniable leading position in Switzerland's banking market. Ultimately, I think the deal has the potential to be beneficial to UBS shareholders over the long-term.",['Bram Berkowitz'],2023-03-22 00:00:00
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4588731-ubs-just-got-monster-bargain-investors-can-too,"UBS Just Got A Monster Bargain - And Investors Can, Too (NYSE:CS)","AlexLMX/iStock via Getty Images

UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) made an exceptional deal buying Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS) for about $3.25 billion - valuing the Swiss banking giant CS at only a fraction of the Friday close market cap of about $8 billion. Although UBS investors' initial reaction to the deal is negative, with UBS shares being down as much as 15% on the open (SIX exchange trading reference), I argue that the selloff is a mistake.

The eventual value this acquisition is likely to bring to UBS over the long term is hard to express in numbers (for now). But investors should consider that after the CS acquisition, UBS will be the Swiss' last global banking giant, a jewel that Swiss authorities will likely protect and support. Or in other words, if the Swiss authorities expand such effort to save the country's #2 bank, how aggressively will they intervene to protect the combined entity of #1 and #2? The implications for UBS cost of equity/ risk should be obvious...

Reflecting on the combined strength of UBS/ Credit Suisse, paired with risk-protection of up to CHF 25 billion, it hard to argue that UBS didn't make a monster bargain. And if UBS can make such a bargain, UBS investors can, too -- by buying UBS stock.

UBS Swallows Credit Suisse On Attractive Terms

After months of stress for Credit Suisse, which culminated in a heated negotiation over the past weekend, UBS has agreed to acquire Credit Suisse at a value of approximately 3 billion Swiss francs--a discount of close to 70% as compared to Credit Suisse's market value as of Friday, 17th March. Given that the deal is transacted through equity exchange, UBS intends to buy Credit Suisse offering 0.76 of its shares for each CS share.

In order to support the deal, Swiss authorities orchestrated exceptional support: The Swiss National Bank committed up to CHF 100 billion in financing, while the Swiss financial regulator Finma pushed measures to facilitate the quick execution of the deal, including (A) the elimination of the need for UBS to obtain shareholder approval for the deal, (B) the wiping out of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds, and (C) the overlooking of monopoly concerns in the Swiss banking market.

UBS acquisition of Credit Suisse - presentation

Expanding on the ""wiping out of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds,"" which eases UBS' financial burden by about CHF 15.8 billion, I would also like to point out that the Swiss authorities have further agreed to cover losses for CS non-core assets by up to CHF 9 billion, if losses exceed an initial CHF 5 billion that will be borne by UBS. This brings UBS cumulative downside protection to about CHF 25 billion, which is close to 50% of UBS current market cap!

UBS Strategy Unchanged, But Scaled

Following the UBS / Credit Suisse merger, UBS' CEO Ralph Hamers vowed that the bank's strategy will remain unchanged -- the Swiss giant will continue to operate with a focus on the low-risk and asset-light Wealth and Asset Management. But by adding about CHF 1.6 trillion of Credit Suisse' assets under management (""AUM""), the strategy has immediately accumulated scale.

Adding Scale to GWM and AM

With an estimated CHF 5 trillion of invested assets for the pro-forma entity, UBS is projected to become the world's second-largest wealth manager, just behind Morgan Stanley. And with regards to asset management, UBS is projected to claim the #3 in Europe and the #11 globally.

Shrinking CS' Investment Bank

Keeping UBS' strategy unchanged also means that UBS will shrink CS' legacy investment bank. At a press conference announcing the deal, UBS chairman Kelleher commented:

Let me be very specific on this: UBS intends to downsize Credit Suisse’s investment banking business and align it with our conservative risk culture, ... We will be de-risking a lot of the tricky businesses that we are inheriting.

While markets are still waiting for more guidance, according to further comments by Kellner, the combined investment banks of UBS and Credit Suisse won’t claim more than 25% of the new entity's risk-weighted assets.

At this point, no information was given to what is expected to happen to the CS First Boston spin-out. But I personally continue to expect a liquidity event (IPO).

Talking Leadership In Swiss Retail Banking

With specific focus on Switzerland, which is undoubtedly an attractive market for banking, the combined entity of UBS and Credit Suisse is modelled to account for about CHF 333 billion of customer deposits and CHF 307 billion of loans. As compared to the second largest institution, Raiffeisen, both metrics top the competitors' size by about 50%.

As a side note, analysts at JPMorgan Chase (JPM) have previously valued the Swiss retail banking unit at a minimum of CHF 10 billion Swiss francs, which is about triple the purchase price of the entire CS group!

Financial Implications

Putting everything into numbers, UBS management expects that the deal will materialize a 74% increase in UBS' tangible book value per share at Day-1. And regarding profitability, the deal could potentially unlock annual cost reduction of more than CHF 8 billion by 2027--the year when the deal is projected to be EPS accreditive. Admittedly, waiting 5 years for a deal to be EPS accreditive is not very exciting. But I understand that a merger of such scale is likely take a lot of time.

Conclusion

Before the CS deal, I assigned a ""Buy"" recommendation to UBS stock, arguing that the market is likely undervaluing UBS' exceptional position as a wealth and asset manager. Now, after UBS has bought its key domestic rival Credit Suisse for close to nothing, I am even more confident in my long-term UBS thesis -- the stock can trade much higher.

While it is too early for me to assign a new share price to UBS (I would wait for further disclosures and management estimates/ guidance), I am confident to already argue that the new target price will be higher than the $34.46 estimated previously.

UBS has posted two consecutive years of record profits and returns to shareholders under Hamers, but Kelleher said the acquisition of Credit Suisse ""created a new reality"" and ""imposes new priorities"" on the board.

In a press conference, UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher lauded Hamers' tenure, highlighting the company's ""unprecedented success despite a challenging environment"" under the Dutchman's tutelage, and his instrumental role in delivering the Credit Suisse deal.

UBS announced on Wednesday that the former CEO would replace Ralph Hamers from April 5, as the Swiss bank undertakes the mammoth task of integrating fallen rival Credit Suisse into its business.

Incoming UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti on Wednesday said his return to the helm was ""a call of duty,"" as the Swiss veteran takes on the task of restoring order to the country's battered financial reputation .

""In particular, he built financial strength and improved resilience by putting the firm's leading global wealth management business and Swiss universal bank at its core,"" Kelleher said of Ermotti's tenure as CEO from November 2011 to October 2020.

""Sergio swiftly transformed the investment bank by cutting its footprint, and achieved a profound culture change within the bank which allowed it to regain the trust of clients and other stakeholders while restoring people's pride in working for UBS.""

He added that this, combined with Ermotti's ""deep understanding of the financial service industry in Switzerland and globally,"" made the Swiss banking veteran the man for the job.

Credit Suisse's emergency sale to UBS followed years of losses and scandals, and Swiss authorities and regulators' hasty brokerage of the deal over the course of a weekend dealt a blow to the country's reputation for financial stability.

Kelleher emphasized that Ermotti's task — the successful integration of Credit Suisse into UBS — was ""essential for both banks' clients, people and investors, for Switzerland and for the global financial system in general.""

Ermotti's first stint as CEO began amid the fallout from a $2.3 billion loss inflicted on the bank by a rogue trader in London. He inherited an ailing investment bank that had been forced to write off more than $50 billion during the great financial crisis, along with being implicated in what would become a costly Libor investigation.

After a campaign of sweeping job cuts, an exit from substantial portions of the fixed income trading division, the investment bank was focused and streamlined, and Ermotti's radical course of action was welcomed by investors.

'Call of duty'

Ermotti leaves his post as chairman of Swiss Re, one of the world's largest reinsurance companies, in order to take the reins at the new combined Swiss banking behemoth.

Asked by CNBC during Wednesday's press conference about his motivation for returning to UBS, Ermotti said there was ""a call of duty aspect"" to his decision.

""And also, frankly speaking, I always thought that despite all these discussions and the size of the bank, I always felt that the next chapter I wanted to write back then was a chapter of doing a transaction like this one.""

GENEVA -- UBS said Wednesday that it's bringing back former CEO Sergio Ermotti to lead the Swiss bank as it executes a government-orchestrated plan to take over struggling rival Credit Suisse.

Ermotti, who was the bank's top executive for nine years and led a turnaround following the 2008 global financial crisis, will take over next Wednesday from CEO Ralph Hamers.

Hamers took up the job in November 2020 and will remain at UBS during a transition period “to ensure a successful closure of the transaction and a smooth handover,” the bank said in a statement.

“Whilst Ralph was capable of doing the job, we felt that Sergio was better suited to navigating these things,” Chairman Colm Kelleher said on a conference call, alluding to the UBS board decision. “I cannot reemphasize how big this deal is in terms of financial history and financial engineering that’s required.”

UBS credited Ermotti, who is now chairman of insurer Swiss Re, for having “cut its footprint” and changing the culture of the bank — and it pointed to his experience in bringing big financial institutions together.

Ermotti, who hails from the southern, mostly Italian-speaking Swiss region of Ticino, acknowledged that “coming back to manage this situation is a challenge” but felt “a sense of call-of-duty aspect” to return.

Plus, he said he had contemplated a tie-up like the one with Credit Suisse while previously in the top job, and it would be a bit of a ”contradiction"" for him not to accept the post ""to basically execute on what I believe was the right next move for UBS.”

Kelleher said he called Ermotti “to explore the possibility of this” a day after the emergency takeover deal was settled on March 19, which involved Swiss regulators, the federal government and top executives at both banks.

“This is is the biggest single financial transaction since 2008. That brings significant execution risk,” Kelleher said.

The hastily arranged, $3.25 billion deal for Credit Suisse aimed to stem the upheaval in the global financial system after the collapse of two U.S. banks and jitters about long-running troubles at Credit Suisse led shares of Switzerland’s second-largest bank to tank and customers to pull out their money.

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after the central bank’s plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and customers. The Swiss executive branch passed emergency measures to bypass shareholder approval.

Uncertainties still lie ahead, including a U.S. Senate committee report released Wednesday that says Credit Suisse violated a plea agreement with U.S. authorities by failing to report secret offshore accounts that wealthy Americans used to avoid paying taxes.

UBS said it assessed outstanding lawsuits and investigations as part of the Credit Suisse acquisition and expects the deal to be beneficial for shareholders. It says it's working to close the sale and get approval from regulators in the coming weeks or months.

Hamers, the outgoing CEO, said UBS executives want to ensure “a digestible transaction” in terms of risk. He said there were plans to “manage down the investment bank” at Credit Suisse because many of the activities were not central for UBS.

UBS leaders announced no immediate plan about job cuts linked to the deal.

Swiss lawmakers and academics have raised concerns that the deal could create an unwieldy Swiss banking behemoth, while UBS executives said regulatory issues loom internationally before the deal can close.

Ermotti suggested he didn't view “too big too fail” concerns as a problem.

“I do think that scale and size is not a problem if it is focused and well-managed,” he said. “For me, the debate nowadays is not ‘too big to fail' but ‘too small to survive’ — and we want to be a winner.”

Many Credit Suisse customers have expressed regret at the looming disappearance of a 167-year-old bank that has been a pillar of Switzerland's renowned banking and financial industry.

Holders of so-called “AT1,” or additional tier 1 bonds, purchased through Credit Suisse were shocked to learn that their investments were wiped out in the deal — a move that some claimed is illegal.

“In my eyes, this is against the law,” Patrik Kauffman, a fund manager at Aquila Asset Management, a firm that invests in AT1 bonds, told the Financial Times.

The “shotgun wedding” sale of the 166-year-old Credit Suisse to its historic arch-enemy is the latest shock to the global financial system — with analysts wondering whether more European banks were due to fall.

Shares of UBS rebounded in European markets on Monday afternoon, reversing an earlier slide. UBS stock was up some 2% in Zurich while Credit Suisse shares cratered by some 60%.

As a result of the deal, UBS has seen its total assets balloon to a whopping $5 trillion.

The lender will also benefit from a special government waiver allowing it to keep Credit Suisse’s profitable unit that was purchased at a discount.

UBS also managed to secure billions of dollars worth of guarantees from the Swiss government aimed at covering losses.

AT1 bonds, which are also known as “contingent convertibles,” are bonds that were created after the 2008 financial crisis.

These debt instruments, which count toward banks’ regulatory capital, are considered riskier.

While they typically provide a higher yield than most other bonds, they can also be either converted into equity or written down entirely if a lender goes under.

Kauffman described the writedown as “insane,” telling FT: “We’ve never seen this before. I don’t think this would be allowed to happen again.”

The takeover by UBS, which was pushed by Swiss authorities who were looking to shore up confidence in the shaky global banking system in the wake of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank of New York, also resulted in a loss for Credit Suisse shareholders.

Equity holders of Credit Suisse will receive 0.76 Swiss francs — or 82 cents — per share — which is well below the bank’s closing price of around $2 per share.

But the AT1 bloodbath had bondholders seeing red.

“Everyone knows that when you’re buying AT1 bonds, you’re taking risk and you’re there to absorb losses,” Jérôme Legras of Axiom Alternative Investments told FT.

“But show me the losses — there’s still 45 billion Swiss francs ($48.62 billion) of equity in the bank,” he said.

“Shareholders got 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion) and AT1 holders got nothing, which is a reversal of the usual hierarchy.”

The $17 billion wipeout is the largest loss in the $275 billion AT1 debt market to date.

Bid prices on AT1 bonds from banks including Deutsche Bank, HSBC, UBS and BNP Paribas dropped 9 to 12 points on Monday, sending yields sharply higher, data from Tradeweb showed.

At Credit Suisse itself, dollar AT1 bonds were bid as low as 1 cent on the dollar, Tradeweb pricing showed, as investors braced for the wipeout.

GENEVA (AP) — Banking giant UBS is buying troubled rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion, in a deal orchestrated by regulators in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in the global banking system.

Swiss authorities pushed for UBS to take over its smaller rival after a plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and the bank’s customers. Shares of Credit Suisse and other banks plunged last week after the failure of two banks in the U.S. sparked concerns about other potentially shaky institutions in the global financial system.

Credit Suisse is among the 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

The deal was “one of great breadth for the stability of international finance,” said Swiss President Alain Berset as he announced it Sunday night. “An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.”

Switzerland’s executive branch, a seven-member governing body that includes Berset, passed an emergency ordinance allowing the merger to go through without shareholder approval.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann called the sale “a clear turning point.”

“It is a historic, sad and very challenging day for Credit Suisse, for Switzerland and for the global financial markets,” Lehmann said, adding that the focus is now on the future and in particular on the 50,000 Credit Suisse employees, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland.

Following news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated financial moves to stabilize banks in the coming week. This includes daily access to a lending facility for banks looking to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice which was widely used during the 2008 financial crisis.

“Today is one of the most significant days in European banking since 2008, with far-reaching repercussions for the industry,” said Max Georgiou, an analyst at Third Bridge. “These events could alter the course of not only European banking but also the wealth management industry more generally.”

Colm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed the “enormous opportunities” that emerge from the takeover, and highlighted his bank’s “conservative risk culture” — a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse’s reputation for more swashbuckling, aggressive gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said the council “regrets that the bank, which was once a model institution in Switzerland and part of our strong location, was able to get into this situation at all.”

The combination of the two biggest and best-known Swiss banks, each with storied histories dating to the mid-19th century, amounts to a thunderclap for Switzerland’s reputation as a global financial center — leaving it on the cusp of having a single national champion in banking.

The deal follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further panic. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse’s share price began plummeting this week.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde lauded the “swift action” by Swiss officials, saying they were “instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.”

She said the banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.

UBS officials said they plan to sell off parts of Credit Suisse or reduce the bank’s size in the coming months and years.

The Swiss government is providing more than 100 billion francs in aid and financial backstops to make the deal go through.

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs in Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out. The securities are a special type of bonds European bank regulators use to provide banks with a capital cushion in times of distress.

Berset said the Federal Council had already been discussing a long-troubled situation at Credit Suisse since the beginning of the year and held urgent meetings in the last four days amid spiraling concerns about its financial health that caused major swoons in its stock price and raised the specter of the 2007-08 financial crisis.

Investors and banking industry analysts were still digesting the deal, but at least one analyst was sour on the news because it could damage Switzerland’s global banking image.

“A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,” said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas LLC, in an email.

Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

The Credit Suisse parent bank is not part of European Union supervision, but it has entities in several European countries that are. Lagarde reiterated what she said last week after the central bank raised interest rates — that the European banking sector is resilient, with strong financial reserves and plenty of ready cash.

Many of Credit Suisse’s problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve.

The deal with UBS caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn’t invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.

On Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.

Its current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.

While smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.

https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/boomerang-ubs-boss-ticks-several-important-boxes-2023-03-29/,Boomerang UBS boss ticks several important boxes,"













LONDON, March 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - UBS (UBSG.S) could not depend on a relatively inexperienced chief executive as it embarks on the biggest banking merger of the decade. That’s the best explanation for why Chair Colm Kelleher on Wednesday said the Swiss bank was replacing CEO Ralph Hamers with erstwhile boss Sergio Ermotti. Though the move violates several corporate-governance red lines, it improves the group’s chances of successfully absorbing stricken rival Credit Suisse (CSGN.S).

Bringing back the CEO who ran UBS for nine years until his departure in late 2020 is an indictment of the bank’s executive ranks and highlights the scarcity of battle-tested talent in European banking. The Swiss national, who hails from the southern canton of Ticino, did not develop a plausible heir during his tenure at UBS, prompting the board to take a punt on ING (INGA.AS) boss Hamers. One risk for shareholders is that Ermotti again struggles with succession planning, or clashes with Kelleher, whose role he previously coveted.

Still, there are plenty of examples of successful boomerang CEOs, including Steve Jobs at Apple (AAPL.O) and Bob Iger at Walt Disney (DIS.N). UBS has a near-precedent in Oswald Grübel, who parachuted in to run the Swiss bank after its near-death experience in the 2008 financial crisis, having relatively recently been in charge of Credit Suisse.

Hamers’ position looked shaky even before the Credit Suisse deal. UBS cancelled his $1.4 billion takeover of financial-technology group Wealthfront while his penchant for buzzwords, as evidenced by the corporate tagline “reimagining the power of investing”, was hardly reassuring. Nor was his hesitant delivery in a call with analysts after announcing the Credit Suisse deal.

Ermotti ticks several important boxes. First, he has successfully slashed his way through an investment bank before. UBS’s October 2012 strategy, dubbed a “strategic acceleration from a position of strength”, saw Ermotti pledge to axe $90 billion of risk-weighted assets in the investment bank, or 57% of the total, mostly in fixed-income trading. By the following summer, the bank had clawed its way back up to a valuation that exceeded its tangible book value, a sign that investors believed it could earn a respectable return on equity.

UBS shareholders will hope he can repeat the exercise with Credit Suisse, which comes with a bloated and recently unprofitable trading and dealmaking division. Ermotti has long pushed for bank consolidation. During his previous spell in charge, UBS held talks with Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and discussed a merger with Credit Suisse.

Finally, there’s his passport. Putting a Swiss national in charge could help defuse anger with the Credit Suisse rescue, which involved the government waiving competition rules and shareholder rights, and is likely to lead to thousands of job losses in Switzerland. A majority of the alpine nation’s citizens say they disagree with the deal, according to polling reported by Swissinfo. Bringing back Ermotti is far from ideal, but it reduces the risks of UBS being dragged down by its mega-merger.

Regulators faced a sense of urgency to push the deal through on Sunday before markets opened Monday as the specter of Credit Suisse potentially failing next week loomed over the negotiations. Credit Suisse, which has been in business for 167 years, is one of 30 globally systemically important banks, which heightened worries about how global financial markets would react to its implosion.

Talk about the UBS acquisition heated up over the weekend and involved the Swiss government's financial regulators giving it the green light after the sides came to an agreement over the more complex terms of the deal.

The deal involves a large amount of public support, with three tranches of liquidity and loans, as well as a pledge from the Swiss government to absorb up to 9 billion francs in potential losses from the takeover.

The total of 259 billion francs of support is equivalent to a third of Switzerland's entire economic output, which stood at 771 billion francs last year.

""The government's going to have to say to voters why they are putting citizens' money, taxpayer money at risk to bail out a bank that was predominantly servicing the ultra wealthy, doing some pretty extraordinary things with its investment bank and paying people crazy amounts of money relative to what the man in the street gets paid,"" one former global bank CEO, who did not wish to be identified, told Reuters.

Both banks have access to existing lending facilities and may obtain an additional loan of up to 100 billion francs (or about $108 billion), while Credit Suisse can also tap a second liquidity assistance loan of that size that's backstopped by the Swiss federal government.

""The substantial provision of liquidity will ensure that both banks have access to the necessary liquidity,"" the Swiss National Bank announced in a release. ""By providing substantial liquidity assistance, the SNB is fulfilling its mandate to contribute to the stability of the financial system, and it continues to work closely with the federal government and FINMA to this end.""

As a large global financial institution, Credit Suisse has an investment banking arm that it has tried to spin off in recent years, in addition to a local retail bank. UBS' acquisition of those divisions of Credit Suisse, in whole or in part, could create additional regulatory complexity for the firm given its own activities in those areas.

Layoffs are likely as Credit Suisse had previously pledged to cut 9,000 jobs as part of its restructuring, and the bank has investment and local banking divisions that overlap with UBS' operations.

However, in a memo seen by Reuters that was sent to staff on Sunday after the deal announcement, Credit Suisse reassured staff that their bonuses would be paid in full.

CREDIT SUISSE SHARES HIT RECORD LOW

Bloomberg reported that Credit Suisse balked at UBS’ initial offer of $1 billion and argued that it fell well short of the firm’s valuation, which stood at about $9.5 billion as of Friday, and that it would harm the bank’s employees and shareholders. The size of UBS’ offer was first reported by the Financial Times.

UBS has a balance sheet of about $1.1 trillion – roughly twice the size of Credit Suisse – and has been more resilient than Credit Suisse in the years since the global financial crisis of 2008.

Credit Suisse’s distressed financial position arose from billions of dollars in losses from investments gone awry and fines imposed by regulators. Its assets dropped from $1.2 trillion in the third quarter of 2008 to $576 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022.

It’s currently facing class-action lawsuits from U.S. shareholders who allege that the company’s leadership made false and misleading statements about the status of depositors’ outflows last year.

Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS, is reportedly approaching a deal to take over its troubled rival Credit Suisse, a move that could ease growing concerns that the turbulence at the European banking behemoth could ripple through the global economy. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Boards at Switzerland’s two biggest banks have been meeting this weekend and are nearing a merger agreement that could be cinched as early as Sunday, according to the Wall Street Journal. Regulators have proposed allowing the banks to forgo shareholder votes to speed up the deal, the Journal reported.

The discussions are the latest development in more than a week of tumult and fears about the resilience of the global financial system after the shocking collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and subsequent actions on Wall Street and by regulators to shore up major financial institutions.

The banks’ key regulators in the United States, Britain and Switzerland also are considering the legal structure of a deal, as UBS seeks concessions, including some form of government agreement to cover future legal costs, according to the Financial Times. Credit Suisse’s shares jumped 7 percent in after-hours trading.

Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment. The Swiss National Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Germany’s Deutsche Bank also is watching to see if it could acquire certain Credit Suisse businesses, according to a Bloomberg News report.

A takeover could limit fears that the turmoil at Credit Suisse and multiple troubled financial institutions in the United States would create a banking contagion, similar to the events of the 2008 financial crisis. Even after actions by governments and financial institutions this week, the stock market has showed continued worry that the banking industry’s tumult has not settled. Yet experts say that the financial system appears to be on firm ground and that the volatility in the stock market may reflect news developments rather than a signal of a broader crisis.

The discussions follow a week of chaos for Credit Suisse. On Thursday, Switzerland’s central bank provided the company a $53.7 billion liquidity lifeline, after the bank disclosed “material weaknesses” in its financial reporting.

But Credit Suisse’s underlying troubles began well before the recent trouble at banks in the United States. The 167-year-old bank, which originally served the ultrawealthy, has had financial losses, risk and compliance problems and a critical data breach. Credit Suisse in October disclosed that it suffered significant customer withdrawals, and in 2021, it experienced major losses because of its exposure to the collapse of New York-based Archegos Capital Management.

The moves in Europe follow an announcement Thursday that 11 of the biggest banks in the United States would deposit $30 billion into First Republic Bank. The move was aimed at shoring up the bank and sending a signal about the broader security of the U.S. financial system. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley Bank’s parent company on Friday filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

If you squint a little, Tuesday looks like a ""normal"" trading day — almost. That is to say, U.S. markets yesterday were concerned with inflation and interest rate fears, not a banking crisis.

Of course, the major news of the day still revolved around banks. Earlier today, UBS reappointed Ermotti to the position of Group CEO, citing Ermotti's successful repositioning of the bank after the 2008 financial crisis, which allowed UBS to ""regain the trust of clients and other stakeholders."" This suggests UBS is prioritizing stability as it proceeds with its merger with Credit Suisse.

Across the Atlantic, on Tuesday, the Senate grilled U.S. regulators on SVB's collapse. Banks slipped after regulators said they were in favor of tighter rules for banks. But the movement — the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF dropped 0.09% — was marginal, compared with the drastic swings of the past two weeks.

While we don't know the effects of UBS' CEO swap yet, in the U.S., interest rates, arguably, had a greater effect than the Senate hearing on market moves. U.S. Treasury yields climbed again — the 2-year yield hit 4.08%, breaching the 4% threshold for the first time in almost a week, and the 10-year yield rose to 3.571%. The rise in yields suggests traders are growing confident the banking turmoil is subsiding, and they're turning their attention back to inflation.

Indeed, the expectations index from the Conference Board showed consumers think inflation will remain at 6.3% over the next 12 months, and their short-term outlook is at a level consistent with an imminent recession. (Though it has to be acknowledged that consumer outlook brightened slightly from February, even after SVB's collapse.)

As a result, the rate-sensitive Nasdaq Composite fell a second day, losing 0.45%. It might seem like a small decline, but Solus Alternative Asset Management's Dan Greenhaus warned ""only the top quintile [of the Nasdaq] is up; all four of the other quintiles are down,"" which indicates the index is ""a little weaker than the headline suggests."" Other major indexes didn't fare better. The S&P 500 sank 0.16% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.12%.

""For the time being, investors seem to be looking beyond the challenges in the financial sector and recognizing that U.S. economic growth continues to be resilient,"" said Brian Levitt, global market strategist for Invesco. In a bizarre way, even if that's bad news for inflation, that's probably good news for everyone who's been consumed by banking fears in recent days.

Schematically, a bank borrows a bunch of money from depositors and other creditors and uses the money to make loans and buy securities and do other risky investments. If the investments end up being worth more than the deposits, the shareholders keep what’s left. If the investments end up being worth less than the deposits then, uh, that’s bad. Then the shareholders don’t own the bank anymore, for one thing, but that’s really the least of your problems. The real problem is that the depositors can’t lose money; the banking system relies on bank deposits being usable as money. “Banks are speculative investment funds grafted on top of critical infrastructure,” Matt Klein wrote last week. The liabilities (deposits, etc.) are the critical infrastructure; the assets (loans, securities) are the speculative investment fund. The bank is a machine for turning safe deposits into risky investments. If the investments end up being worth less than the deposits, then regulators and central banks step in and there is some sort of rushed rescue to make sure that the depositors still get paid.

One important consequence of this is that the equity of the bank — the shareholders’ ownership stake — is just a tiny sliver resting on top of an enormous iceberg of liabilities. In a good profitable conservative bank, there might be $100 of assets, $90 of liabilities and thus $10 of equity. The liabilities are certain and knowable, things like deposits that really need to be paid back at 100 cents on the dollar. The assets are risky and variable, and their valuation is a bit of a guess: They include securities with volatile market prices, weird derivatives that are hard to value, and business loans with uncertain probabilities of being paid back. The bank applies some accounting conventions and makes some guesses and comes up with a value of $100 for its assets, but there is a range of uncertainty around that number.","['Matt Levine', 'Follow The Authors']",2023-03-20 00:00:00

The pan-European Stoxx 600 index closed up 1.3%, with banks up 1.9%. Tech stocks reversed Tuesday's decline with a 2.7% gain while the financial services sector was up 1.8%.

European stock markets closed higher on Wednesday as investor doubts over the health of the banking sector continued to wane.

UBS shares were up 4.5% mid-afternoon after the bank announced Sergio Ermotti would return to his role as group CEO from April 5, following the recent acquisition of Credit Suisse. Shares of the bank ended the session 3.7% higher.

Beat Wittmann, partner at Porta Advisors, said the level of anger among the public over the ""failure of successive managements"" at Credit Suisse, who oversaw numerous scandals, and toward policymakers over their failure to intervene earlier, should not be underestimated.

""Trust has to be rebuilt. Trust in the banking sector at large and trust with policymakers, and Sergio Ermotti is certainly somebody who is able to deliver stability and instil trust,"" Wittman told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

Ermotti was group CEO at UBS from November 2011 to October 2020.

Regional markets closed mixed Tuesday, with investors seemingly in a holding pattern after a serious bout of market volatility.

Banks managed to finish higher after a choppy session, though there was fresh bad news as French authorities searched the offices of several large banks on the suspicion of money laundering and fiscal fraud.

""Every day that passes reinforces the market's, and our, conviction that a line has been drawn under systemic banking worries (individual travails are another matter),"" analysts at ING Bank said in a morning note.

""With markets having spent that last three weeks looking for hairline fractures in every bank's balance sheet and business model, there is a case to be made that a large number of closets have already been checked for skeletons.""

More concerning for markets now is the macroeconomic picture, they said, adding that there's a greater likelihood of a credit crunch.","['Jenni Reid Holly Ellyatt', 'Jenni Reid', 'Holly Ellyatt']",2023-03-29 00:00:00
https://nypost.com/2023/03/18/ubs-closing-in-on-deal-to-buy-fellow-swiss-bank-credit-suisse/,UBS closing in on deal to buy fellow Swiss bank Credit Suisse,"Swiss bank UBS Group is closing in on a deal to take over its rival Credit Suisse amid a weekend of frenzied negotiations, according to multiple reports.

The Swiss government and other global authorities, including some from the US, are working toward sealing the agreement on Sunday in the hopes of shoring up trust in the banking system before the markets open Monday.

The scramble to get the deal done is playing out after the Swiss National Bank and the country’s top regulator, Finma, told their international counterparts they regard a deal with UBS as the only option to stop Credit Suisse from collapsing, the Financial Times reported.

It will be the first combination of two global systemically important banks since the financial crisis of 2008-2009, according to Bloomberg News.

A full merger would create one of the largest financial institutions in Europe.

Switzerland is preparing to use emergency measures to fast-track the deal, the FT said.

The country’s regulators have offered to waive rules that ordinarily require six weeks’ notification and shareholder votes on a takeover, in order to make the sale happen quickly.

The 167-year-old Credit Suisse got more than $50 billion from the Swiss National Bank this week as worries mounted about its solvency, following the shock to the banking system generated by the collapse of the California-based Silicon Valley Bank.

But that infusion didn’t stop investors from selling off the bank’s stock, or slow down depositors who were pulling their money out of accounts at a rate of $10.8 billion per day, the FT reported.

The ongoing panic forced the Swiss National Bank and the country’s financial regulator to organize the weekend’s talks on the potential takeover by UBS, which with $1.1 trillion in assets is about twice the size of Credit Suisse, the Wall Street Journal reported.

UBS is asking the Swiss government to cover about $6 billion in costs related to a potential takeover, Reuters reported. That would cover both expenses associated with winding down some of the ailing bank’s operations and legal bills.

Exactly how the sale will be worked out is still up in the air. It’s possible UBS could take over all of Credit Suisse, but reports said the fate of its huge retail bank is one question — and its troubled investment bank is another.

UBS, which reported a 2022 profit of $7.6 billion, is likely to win Credit Suisse’s wealth management business, which will come with high-priced clients in Asia and the Middle East.

Credit Suisse posted a loss of $7.9 billion last year.

Credit Suisse had around 50,000 employees at the end of 2022, including more than 16,000 in Switzerland.

Its global operations include an investment banking unit in New York and an operations hub near Raleigh, North Carolina.

UBS has around 74,000 employees worldwide.

Up to 10,000 jobs may be eliminated if the two banks combine, but it was unclear which divisions of the banks might be hit by any cuts.

Credit Suisse announced a plan to cut 9,000 jobs last year as it struggled to reorganize.

It’s still possible the deal may not go through, and other financial players are also reportedly in the mix, the Journal reported.

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/19/business/credit-suisse-ubs-rescue/index.html,UBS is buying Credit Suisse in bid to halt banking crisis,"London CNN —

Switzerland’s biggest bank, UBS, has agreed to buy its ailing rival Credit Suisse in an emergency rescue deal aimed at stemming financial market panic unleashed by the failure of two American banks earlier this month.

“UBS today announced the takeover of Credit Suisse,” the Swiss National Bank said in a statement Sunday. It said the rescue would “secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy.”

UBS is paying 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion) for Credit Suisse, about 60% less than the bank was worth when markets closed on Friday. Credit Suisse shareholders will be largely wiped out, receiving the equivalent of just 0.76 Swiss francs in UBS shares for stock that was worth 1.86 Swiss francs on Friday. Owners of $17 billion worth of “additional tier one” bonds — a riskier class of bank debt — will lose everything, Swiss regulators said.

Extraordinarily, the deal will not need the approval of shareholders after the Swiss government agreed to change the law to remove any uncertainty about the deal.

Credit Suisse (CS) had been losing the trust of investors and customers for years. In 2022, it recorded its worst loss since the global financial crisis. But confidence collapsed last week after it acknowledged “material weakness” in its bookkeeping and as the demise of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank spread fear about weaker institutions at a time when soaring interest rates have undermined the value of some financial assets.

Shares in the 167-year-old bank fell 25% over the week, money poured from investment funds it manages and at one point account holders were withdrawing deposits of more than $10 billion per day, the Financial Times reported. An emergency loan of nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank failed to stop the bleeding.

But it did “build a bridge” to the weekend, to allow the rescue to be pieced together, Swiss officials said Sunday night.

“This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue,” UBS chairman Colm Kelleher told reporters.

“It is absolutely essential to the financial structure of Switzerland and … to global finance,” he told reporters.

Desperate to prevent the meltdown spreading through the global financial system on Monday, Swiss authorities initiated the search for a private sector solution, with limited state support, while reportedly considering Plan B — a full or partial nationalization.

“Given recent extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances, the announced merger represents the best available outcome,” Credit Suisse chairman Axel Lehmann said in a statement.

“This has been an extremely challenging time for Credit Suisse and while the team has worked tirelessly to address many significant legacy issues and execute on its new strategy, we are forced to reach a solution today that provides a durable outcome.”

The emergency takeover was agreed to after a days of frantic negotiations involving financial regulators in Switzerland, the United States and United Kingdom. UBS (UBS) and Credit Suisse rank among the 30 most important banks in the global financial system, and together they have almost $1.7 trillion in assets.

Regulators applaud the takeover

Financial market regulators around the world cheered UBS’ action to take over Credit Suisse.

US authorities said they supported the action and worked closely with the Swiss central bank to assist the takeover.

“We welcome the announcements by the Swiss authorities today to support financial stability,” said US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a joint statement. “The capital and liquidity positions of the US. banking system are strong, and the US financial system is resilient.”

Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, said the banking sector remains resilient but the ECB stands at the ready to help banks maintain enough cash on hand to fund their operations if the need arises.

“I welcome the swift action and the decisions taken by the Swiss authorities,” Lagarde said. “They are instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.

The Bank of England said it welcomed the measures taken by the Swiss authorities “to support financial stability.”

“We have been engaging closely with international counterparts throughout the preparations for today’s announcements and will continue to support their implementation,” it said in a statement. “The UK banking system is well capitalized and funded, and remains safe and sound.”

How UBS and Credit Suisse will fit together

The global headquarters of UBS and Credit Suisse are just 300 yards apart in Zurich but the banks’ fortunes have been on very different paths recently. Shares of UBS have climbed 15% in the past two years, and it booked a profit of $7.6 billion in 2022. It had a stock market value of about $65 billion on Friday, according to Refinitiv.

Credit Suisse shares have lost 84% of their value over the same period, and last year it posted a loss of $7.9 billion. It was worth just $8 billion at the end of last week.

Dating back to 1856, Credit Suisse has its roots in the Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (SKA), which was set up to finance the expansion of the railroad network and industrialization of Switzerland.

In addition to being Switzerland’s second biggest bank, it looks after the wealth of many of the world’s richest people and offers global investment banking services. It had more than 50,000 employees at the end of 2022, 17,000 of those in Switzerland.

The Swiss National Bank said it would provide a loan of 100 billion Swiss francs ($108 billion) to UBS and Credit Suisse to boost liquidity.

UBS Chief Executive Ralph Hamers will be CEO of the combined bank, and Kelleher will serve as chairman.

The takeover will reinforce the position of UBS as the world’s leading wealth manager with $5 trillion of invested assets, and boost its ambition to grow in the Americas and Asia. UBS said it expects to generate cost savings of $8 billion per year by 2027. Credit Suisse’s investment bank is in the crosshairs.

“Let me be clear. UBS intends to downsize Credit Suisse’s investment banking business and align it with our conservative risk culture,” Kelleher said.",['Mark Thompson'],2023-03-19 00:00:00

Credit Suisse, the troubled Swiss-based investment bank, received an offer from its intracountry rival Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) to purchase it for around $1 billion, according to the Financial Times. Swiss regulators spearheaded the deal to help restore trust and calm in a highly volatile global banking environment over the last few weeks.

The Wall Street Journal reported talks are still ongoing, and the deal may be subject to change. In the wake of the sudden closures of United States-based Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, along with concerns over the financial strength of the balance sheets of hundreds of small and regional banks, UBS and Swiss regulators need to plan for several exogenous factors that could impact the acquisition. One concern is how much money the Swiss authorities will allocate for guarantees or backstops if the worldwide banking situation worsens.

Both banks offer similar services. UBS and Credit Suisse provide investment banking, high-net-worth wealth management, asset management, stock and bond sales and trading. UBS has more than 74,000 employees working from nearly 50 countries. Credit Suisse is also global and the second largest Swiss bank with around 50,480 employees.

Prepare For Large Layoffs

It is likely that once the two similar institutions combine, significant layoffs will be announced. Since the two banks offer similar products and services, considerable redundancies will exist.

Recruiting on Wall Street for more than 25 years, I’ve seen this trend play out on many occasions. The firm initiating the takeover will drive the process and lean toward saving their employees—to the detriment of those who work for the acquired company.

Since there’s overlap in nearly all the divisions, intense competition between talented people at each organization will occur to keep their jobs. Leadership will likely let go of thousands of workers to save money, cut costs and streamline the new entity during a challenging economy.

Wall Street has already caught the layoff contagion. Top-tier New York City-based investment bank Goldman Sachs let go of around 4,000 white-collar professionals, impacting around 8% of the bank’s global workforce. Goldman laid off 500 employees in September as the economy faltered.

Morgan Stanley, a top competitor of Goldman, let go of around 1,600 people. Credit Suisse previously announced before the SVB implosion that it would ax around 5,000 jobs.

Wells Fargo laid off hundreds of people in its mortgage division because of high interest rates hurting the real estate market. U.K.-based investment bank Barclays, with a strong presence in the U.S., is exiting about 200 employees in its banking and trading units. Citigroup laid off about 50 traders.

Tens of thousands of people may be out of work due to the closures of SVB, Signature Bank, Silvergate Bank and other banking and financial companies with problematic balance sheets, forcing them to slash costs, including downsizing bankers and other personnel.

Why This Is Happening

Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old bank, is one of the world's largest money management firms, ranked among the top 30 global systemically important banks. If the bank fails, it could cause a significant contagion, similar to how the U.S. was concerned about the fall of SVB, which is much smaller than Credit Suisse.

The drama is playing out somewhat like during the great financial crisis. The federal government pushed JPMorgan to absorb the collapsing Bear Stearns investment bank, and Bank of America took on the once-venerable Merrill Lynch. Similarly, UBS was reportedly under the gun of Swiss authorities to acquire its competitor to avoid fueling the fire on an unstable global financial market.

History Repeats Itself

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon bailed out Bear Stearns at the behest of the U.S. government. Dimon said in a letter to shareholders a few years ago about whether or not he’d do this again, “No, we would not do something like Bear Stearns again. In fact, I don’t think our Board would let me take the call.”

At that time, CNBC reported that JPMorgan needed to fund $6 billion for severance packages, ongoing litigation, asset write-downs and an array of expenses. Dimon was cajoled to also picking up Washington Mutual, which saddled JPMorgan with toxic mortgages and legal responsibility for at least $19 billion in fines and settlements with multiple regulators in 2013.

UBS Is Concerned Over Regulatory Baggage And Backstoping Losses

Credit Suisse brings regulatory baggage. The bank had dealings with the now-bankrupt Greensill Capital and connections to the alleged scandal involving Bill Hwang's Archegos Capital Management hedge fund, creating a loss of $5 billion, representing about a year's worth of profit.

Credit Suisse now confronts the unpleasant matter of its shareholders being wiped out. Like other banks, the financial institution faced sudden withdrawals of funds. Venture capitalists called for the U.S. government to backstop any losses emanating from SVB’s shutdown, feverishly trying to get their money out of the bank, causing concern and some panic. Similarly, social-media-induced comments spooked Credit Suisse’s wealthy clients to take their funds elsewhere.

Given all the uncertainty, UBS seeks concessions and protections from the government. In addition to bank safety matters, UBS wants to be protected from pending regulatory investigations and legal issues, which could result in hefty fines.","['Jack Kelly', 'Amy Danise', 'Senior Contributor']",2023-03-19 00:00:00

UBS gives 10 with the most upside,"Dividend stocks may be the way to go for investors as a recession becomes more likely, according to UBS. Dividend stocks on average outperformed the market by 4.5% during the 2001, 2008 and 2020 recessions, the bank said. U.S. equity product manager Joseph Parkhill noted that these stocks can provide a cushion for investor portfolios amid the current uncertainty as inflation remains stubbornly high. Investing strategies focusing on dividend growth ""have been significantly less volatile"" than others focusing on earnings and buyback growth, Parkhill wrote in a Monday note. ""Dividend stocks can provide a margin of safety during uncertain times."" The market has seen wild swings lately, as expectations for a recession increase, with the Federal Reserve raising rates for roughly a year to quell inflation pressures. Given this backdrop, UBS highlighted a slew of dividend stocks with big upsides, based on the bank's price targets. The stocks have current dividend yields higher than the S & P 500 average of 1.7%. Analysts also forecast three-year dividend growth that's at least in the mid-single digits, in addition to sustainable payout ratios. Here are the 10 that are expected to see the largest gains in coming months: Renewable energy-focused investment company Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure had the highest estimated upside on the list, at 92.3%. Two-thirds of analysts covering the stock rate it a buy or overweight, according to FactSet. To be sure, shares have tumbled more than 43% during the past 12 months. Despite the recent investor concerns surrounding the banking sector, several regional banks including Huntington Bancshares and Fifth Third Bancorp made the list. Huntington Bancshares' stock has fallen 20.5% in 2023. Nonetheless, UBS forecasts shares rallying 57.7%. UBS analyst Erika Najarian wrote earlier in the month that Huntington Bancshares has been especially hard-hit relative to its fundamentals, presenting a compelling entry point for investors. UBS is also bullish on Fifth Third Bancorp shares. The bank's price target implies upside of 56.9%. Amid the dip in regional bank stocks, UBS said Fifth Third's ""transition to a high quality regional appears to be fully priced out of the stock at current levels."" Other analysts are also bullish on the stock, with FactSet data showing more than six in 10 rating it a buy or overweight. Shares have declined more than 20% year to date. Insurance group American International Group was also highlighted as a dividend stock with large potential upside. AIG shares have tumbled almost 25% year to date. But, UBS sees shares gaining 64.8%. Pharmacy services giant CVS also made UBS's list. CVS shares have dropped 20.5% since the start of 2023. However, UBS anticipates upside of 37.2%.

https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1144954/why-the-ubs-takeover-of-credit-suisse-is-bad-for-bondholders,Why the UBS Takeover of Credit Suisse Is Bad for Bondholders,"UBS UBS has agreed to buy rival Credit Suisse CS for CHF 3.0 billion (USD 3.2 billion) as Swiss authorities sought to restore confidence in the financial system. This slashed the value of Credit Suisse’s shares, but it’s really the owners of the bank’s low-ranking bonds who are left holding the bag.

Under the terms of the transaction, Credit Suisse shareholders will receive one UBS share for every 22.48 shares of common stock. Based on Friday’s closing prices, the transaction values Credit Suisse shares at CHF 0.76, which is 59% below its last closing price of CHF 1.86.

The last-minute rescue failed to calm nerves early Monday, and bank stocks were under massive pressure throughout the morning.

‘A Real Dent to Market Confidence’

According to Credit Suisse’s news release, “Credit Suisse and UBS have entered into a merger agreement on Sunday following the intervention of the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, the Swiss National Bank, and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority. UBS will be the surviving entity upon closing of the merger transaction.”

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann called the merger “the best available outcome,” while UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher called it an “emergency rescue.” In a separate statement, UBS announced its intention “to acquire Credit Suisse,” opting not to share Credit Suisse’s use of the term “merger.” Combining the two banks will create an asset-management giant with more than $5.0 trillion in assets under management, including more than $3.4 trillion in wealth management. The corporate and investment banking activities, a long-term source of trouble for the Swiss bank, seem destined to disappear or be heavily restructured.

“The UBS takeover in principle is good news, an expedited outcome, rather than wait and watch to see if Credit Suisse could actually manage the necessary restructuring,” commented Michael Field, Morningstar’s Europe market strategist. “The problem for investors generally, however, is that a takeover like this really does hark back to 2008 and forced takeovers of Merrill Lynch and so on. Also, the speed at which Credit Suisse went downhill is worrying, and ultimately a real dent to market confidence.”

Seniority Is Thrown to the Wind

In a surprise move, the Swiss regulator ordered “a complete write-down” of the value of Credit Suisse’s CHF 16 billion in additional Tier 1 bonds, which are also known as contingent convertible bonds. This means that holders of these bonds will be left with nothing. Stock owners, who normally have lower priority than bond owners in a bankruptcy process, will still receive about 40% of the most recent share price under the deal.

Additional Tier 1 bonds are the lowest rung of bank debt. They are risky instruments that yield high returns when things run smoothly, but they are also designed to first feel the pain when a bank gets into trouble.

Their wipeout was perceived as a blow for European debt markets.

“What Finma [the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority] has done breaking capital structure will have a long-term consequence for any Swiss financial debt,” one holder of Credit Suisse additional Tier 1 bonds told in the Financial Times. A banker told the paper that the decision could lead to a “nightmare” in European debt markets, given that bondholders had heavier losses forced on them than shareholders.

Shortly after the deal was announced, the central banks of the euro area, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, and the United States announced that they would increase the frequency of dollar swap transactions from weekly to daily. This is to ensure the supply of liquidity to banks.

A Terrible Week

The crisis-ridden Swiss bank had come under intense pressure last week, triggered by the collapse of three U.S. regional banks—Silicon Valley Bank SIVB, Signature Bank SBNY, and Silvergate Bank SI. On Tuesday, Credit Suisse was able to publish its annual report with a delay, where it became clear that it continued to see liquidity outflows, following CHF 123.2 billion in outflows in 2022. According media reports, Credit Suisse was losing deposits at a CHF 10 billion per day run rate.

The bank’s terminal nosedive was triggered on Wednesday, when its main shareholder, the Saudi National Bank, said it would not provide further financial support. Credit Suisse stock tumbled by more than 30% and fell below CHF 2.00 for the first time.

Later that day, the Swiss National Bank offered to provide liquidity to the group, if needed. Credit Suisse accepted the offer just a few hours later, borrowing CHF 50 billion. The intervention failed to stop the bleeding, and Credit Suisse shares ended the week down 25%.

On Friday evening, the Financial Times reported that UBS was in negotiations about a full or partial takeover of its competitor. It became clear over the weekend that regulators and politicians thought the situation of Switzerland’s second-largest bank was no longer tenable. The deal was made public late on Sunday.

UBS Could Benefit From Takeover

According to Morningstar banking analyst Johann Scholtz, UBS will benefit from the takeover in the long run. “UBS is in a much better position to execute a radical restructuring of Credit Suisse’s business than Credit Suisse was,” he said. “We calculate that UBS’ 2027 cost savings target would reduce Credit Suisse’s 2022 adjusted operating expenses by around 60%. The restructuring will come with material costs, but UBS is better placed than Credit Suisse to absorb this. The challenge for UBS will be to keep revenue attrition to a minimum during the restructuring period.”

https://www.ubs.com/global/en/media/display-page-ndp/en-20230319-tree.html,UBS to acquire Credit Suisse,"UBS plans to acquire Credit Suisse. The combination is expected to create a business with more than USD 5 trillion in total invested assets and sustainable value opportunities. It will further strengthen UBS’s position as the leading Swiss-based global wealth manager with more than USD 3.4 trillion in invested assets on a combined basis, operating in the most attractive growth markets.

The transaction reinforces UBS’s position as the leading universal bank in Switzerland. The combined businesses will be a leading asset manager in Europe, with invested assets of more than USD 1.5 trillion.

UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said: “This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue. We have structured a transaction which will preserve the value left in the business while limiting our downside exposure. Acquiring Credit Suisse’s capabilities in wealth, asset management and Swiss universal banking will augment UBS’s strategy of growing its capital-light businesses. The transaction will bring benefits to clients and create long-term sustainable value for our investors.”

UBS Chief Executive Officer Ralph Hamers said: “Bringing UBS and Credit Suisse together will build on UBS’s strengths and further enhance our ability to serve our clients globally and deepen our best-in-class capabilities. The combination supports our growth ambitions in the Americas and Asia while adding scale to our business in Europe, and we look forward to welcoming our new clients and colleagues across the world in the coming weeks.”

The discussions were initiated jointly by the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, FINMA and the Swiss National Bank and the acquisition has their full support.

Under the terms of the all-share transaction, Credit Suisse shareholders will receive 1 UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares held, equivalent to CHF 0.76/share for a total consideration of CHF 3 billion. UBS benefits from CHF 25 billion of downside protection from the transaction to support marks, purchase price adjustments and restructuring costs, and additional 50% downside protection on non-core assets. Both banks have unrestricted access to the Swiss National Bank existing facilities, through which they can obtain liquidity from the SNB in accordance with the guidelines on monetary policy instruments.

The combination of the two businesses is expected to generate annual run-rate of cost reductions of more than USD 8 billion by 2027.

UBS Investment Bank will reinforce its global competitive position with institutional, corporate and wealth management clients through the acceleration of strategic goals in Global Banking while managing down the rest of Credit Suisse’s Investment Bank. The combined investment banking businesses accounts for approximately 25% of Group risk weighted assets.

UBS anticipates that the transaction is EPS accretive by 2027 and the bank remains capitalized well above its target of 13%.

Colm Kelleher will be Chairman and Ralph Hamers will be Group CEO of the combined entity.

The transaction is not subject to shareholder approval. UBS has obtained pre-agreement from FINMA, Swiss National Bank, Swiss Federal Department of Finance and other core regulators on the timely approval of the transaction.

UBS and any of its directors or employees may be entitled at any time to hold long or short positions in investment instruments referred to herein, carry out transactions involving relevant investment instruments in the capacity of principal or agent, or provide any other services or have officers, who serve as directors, either to/for the issuer, the investment instrument itself or to/for any company commercially or financially affiliated to such issuers. At any time, investment decisions (including whether to buy, sell or hold securities) made by UBS and its employees may differ from or be contrary to the opinions expressed in UBS research publications. Some investments may not be readily realizable since the market in the securities is illiquid and therefore valuing the investment and identifying the risk to which you are exposed may be difficult to quantify. UBS relies on information barriers to control the flow of information contained in one or more areas within UBS, into other areas, units, divisions or affiliates of UBS. Futures and options trading is not suitable for every investor as there is a substantial risk of loss, and losses in excess of an initial investment may occur. Past performance of an investment is no guarantee for its future performance. Additional information will be made available upon request. Some investments may be subject to sudden and large falls in value and on realization you may receive back less than you invested or may be required to pay more. Changes in foreign exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the price, value or income of an investment. The analyst(s) responsible for the preparation of this report may interact with trading desk personnel, sales personnel and other constituencies for the purpose of gathering, synthesizing and interpreting market information.

Tax treatment depends on the individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future. UBS does not provide legal or tax advice and makes no representations as to the tax treatment of assets or the investment returns thereon both in general or with reference to specific client's circumstances and needs. We are of necessity unable to take into account the particular investment objectives, financial situation and needs of our individual clients and we would recommend that you take financial and/or tax advice as to the implications (including tax) of investing in any of the products mentioned herein.

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into investment process and portfolio construction. Strategies across geographies and styles approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio manager’s ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio consisting primarily of sustainable investments may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered by the portfolio manager, and the investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ. Companies may not necessarily meet high performance standards on all aspects of ESG or sustainable investing issues; there is also no guarantee that any company will meet expectations in connection with corporate responsibility, sustainability, and/or impact performance.

Disclaimer = Risikohinweise

Die Anlagebeurteilungen des Chief Investment Office von UBS («CIO») werden durch Global Wealth Management von UBS Switzerland AG (in der Schweiz durch die FINMA beaufsichtigt) oder deren verbundenen Unternehmen («UBS») produziert und veröffentlicht.

Die Anlagebeurteilungen wurden im Einklang mit den gesetzlichen Erfordernissen zur Förderung der Unabhängigkeit des Anlageresearch erstellt.

Allgemeines Anlageresearch – Risikohinweise:

Diese Publikation dient ausschliesslich zu Ihrer Information und stellt weder ein Angebot noch eine Aufforderung zur Offertenstellung zum Kauf oder Verkauf von Anlage- oder anderen spezifischen Produkten dar. Die in dieser Publikation enthaltene Analyse ist nicht als persönliche Empfehlung aufzufassen und berücksichtigt weder die Anlageziele noch die Anlagestrategien oder die finanzielle Situation oder Bedürfnisse einer bestimmten Person. Sie basiert auf zahlreichen Annahmen. Unterschiedliche Annahmen können zu materiell unterschiedlichen Ergebnissen führen. Bestimmte Dienstleistungen und Produkte unterliegen gesetzlichen Beschränkungen und können deshalb nicht unbeschränkt weltweit angeboten und/oder von allen Investoren erworben werden. Alle in dieser Publikation enthaltenen Informationen und Meinungen stammen aus als zuverlässig und glaubwürdig eingestuften Quellen, trotzdem lehnen wir jede vertragliche oder stillschweigende Haftung für falsche oder unvollständige Informationen ab (ausgenommen sind Offenlegungen, die sich auf UBS beziehen). Alle Informationen und Meinungen sowie angegebenen Prognosen, Einschätzungen und Marktpreise sind nur zum Zeitpunkt der Erstellung dieser Publikation aktuell und können sich jederzeit ohne Vorankündigung ändern. Hierin geäusserte Meinungen können von den Meinungen anderer Geschäftsbereiche von UBS abweichen oder diesen widersprechen, da sie auf der Anwendung unterschiedlicher Annahmen und/oder Kriterien basieren.

Dieses Dokument oder die darin enthaltenen Informationen (einschliesslich Prognosen, Werte, Indizes oder sonstiger berechneter Beträge («Werte»)) dürfen unter keinen Umständen für folgende Zwecke verwendet werden: (i) für Bewertungs- oder buchhalterische Zwecke; (ii) zur Bestimmung der fälligen oder zahlbaren Beträge, Preise oder Werte von Finanzinstrumenten oder -verträgen; oder (iii) zur Messung der Performance von Finanzinstrumenten, einschliesslich zwecks Nachverfolgung der Rendite oder Performance eines Werts, Festlegung der Vermögensallokation des Portfolios oder Berechnung der Performance Fees. UBS und ihre Direktoren oder Mitarbeiter könnten berechtigt sein, jederzeit Long- oder Short-Positionen in hierin erwähnten Anlageinstrumenten zu halten, in ihrer Eigenschaft als Auftraggeber oder Mandatsträger Transaktionen mit relevanten Anlageinstrumenten auszuführen oder für den Emittenten beziehungsweise eine mit diesem Emittenten wirtschaftlich oder finanziell verbundene Gesellschaft bzw. das Anlageinstrument selbst andere Dienstleistungen zu erbringen. Zudem könnten Mitglieder der Konzernleitung bei der Emittentin oder einer mit ihr verbundenen Gesellschaft als Verwaltungsräte tätig sein. Die von UBS und ihren Mitarbeitern getroffenen Anlageentscheidungen (einschliesslich der Entscheidung, Wertpapiere zu kaufen, verkaufen oder zu halten) könnten von den in den Research-Publikationen von UBS geäusserten Meinungen abweichen oder ihnen widersprechen. Bei Illiquidität des Wertpapiermarkts kann es vorkommen, dass sich gewisse Anlageprodukte nicht sofort realisieren lassen. Aus diesem Grund ist es manchmal schwierig, den Wert Ihrer Anlage und die Risiken, denen Sie ausgesetzt sind, zu quantifizieren. UBS setzt Informationsbarrieren ein, um den Informationsfluss aus einem oder mehreren Bereichen innerhalb von UBS in andere Bereiche, Einheiten, Divisionen oder verbundene Unternehmen von UBS zu steuern. Der Termin- und Optionenhandel eignet sich nicht für jeden Anleger, da ein erhebliches Verlustrisiko besteht und die Verluste den ursprünglich investierten Betrag übersteigen können. Die Wertentwicklung einer Anlage in der Vergangenheit stellt keine Gewähr für künftige Ergebnisse dar. Weitere Informationen sind auf Anfrage erhältlich. Manche Anlagen können plötzlichen und erheblichen Wertverlusten unterworfen sein. Bei einer Liquidation Ihrer Anlagewerte kann es vorkommen, dass Sie weniger zurückerhalten als Sie investiert haben, oder dass man Sie zu einer Zusatzzahlung verpflichtet. Wechselkursschwankungen können sich negativ auf den Preis, Wert oder den Ertrag einer Anlage auswirken. Der/Die Analyst(en), der/die diesen Bericht erstellt hat/haben, kann/können zum Zweck der Sammlung, Zusammenfassung und Interpretation von Marktinformationen mit Mitarbeitern des Trading Desk und des Vertriebs sowie anderen Gruppen interagieren.

Die steuerliche Behandlung hängt von der individuellen Situation ab und kann sich in Zukunft ändern. UBS erbringt keine Rechts- oder Steuerberatung und macht keinerlei Zusicherung im Hinblick auf die steuerliche Behandlung von Vermögenswerten oder deren Anlagerenditen – weder im Allgemeinen noch in Bezug auf die Verhältnisse und Bedürfnisse eines spezifischen Kunden. Wir können nicht auf die persönlichen Anlageziele, finanziellen Situationen und Bedürfnisse unserer einzelnen Kunden eingehen und empfehlen Ihnen deshalb, vor jeder Investition Ihren Finanz- und/oder Steuerberater bezüglich möglicher – einschliesslich steuertechnischer – Auswirkungen zu konsultieren.

Wichtige Informationen über nachhaltige Anlagestrategien: Nachhaltige Anlagestrategien versuchen, die Faktoren Umwelt, Soziales und Unternehmensführung (ESG) beim Anlageprozess und Portfolioaufbau miteinzubeziehen. So verschieden die Strategien je nach geografischer Region und Anlagestil sind, so unterschiedlich ist deren Vorgehen bezüglich ESG-Analysen und der Einbeziehung der daraus resultierenden Erkenntnisse. Wenn ein Portfoliomanager ESG-Faktoren oder Nachhaltigkeitskriterien einbezieht, kann er bestimmte Anlagechancen möglicherweise nicht nutzen, die ansonsten zu seinem Anlageziel und anderen grundsätzlichen Anlagestrategien passen würden. Die Erträge eines Portfolios, das hauptsächlich aus nachhaltigen Anlagen besteht, sind unter Umständen geringer oder höher als die eines Portfolios, bei dem der Portfoliomanager keine ESG-Faktoren, Ausschlusskriterien oder andere Nachhaltigkeitsthemen berücksichtigt. Zudem kann ein solches Portfolio Unterschiede hinsichtlich der Anlagechancen aufweisen. Unternehmen erfüllen möglicherweise nicht bei allen Aspekten für ESG oder nachhaltiges Investieren hohe Performancestandards. Es gibt auch keine Garantie, dass ein Unternehmen die Erwartungen bezüglich der Corporate Responsibility, Nachhaltigkeit und/oder Wirkung erfüllt.

Les prévisions de placement de l’UBS Chief Investment Office («CIO») sont préparées et publiées par l'activité Global Wealth Management d’UBS Switzerland AG (assujettie à la surveillance de la FINMA en Suisse ou ses entreprises associées («UBS»).

Les opinions de placement ont été préparées conformément aux dispositions légales conçues pour favoriser l’indépendance de la recherche financière.

Informations générales sur la recherche financière et les risques:

Cette publication vous est adressée à titre d’information uniquement et ne constitue ni ne contient aucune incitation ou offre d’achat ou de cession de quelque valeur mobilière ou instrument financier que ce soit. L'analyse figurant ici ne constitue pas une recommandation personnelle ni ne prend en compte les objectifs de placement, les stratégies de placement, la situation financière et les besoins particuliers de chaque destinataire de ladite publication. Des hypothèses différentes peuvent entraîner des résultats sensiblement différents. Elle repose sur de nombreuses hypothèses. Certains services et produits sont susceptibles de faire l’objet de restrictions juridiques et ne peuvent par conséquent pas être offerts dans tous les pays sans restriction aucune et/ou peuvent ne pas être offerts à la vente à tous les investisseurs. Bien que ce document ait été établi à partir de sources que nous estimons dignes de foi, il n’offre aucune garantie quant à l’exactitude et à l’exhaustivité des informations et appréciations qu’il contient à l’exception des informations divulguées en rapport avec UBS. Toutes les informations et opinions ainsi que les prévisions, estimations et prix du marché indiqués correspondent à la date du présent rapport et peuvent varier sans préavis. En raison de l’application d’hypothèses et de critères différents, les appréciations présentées dans ce document peuvent différer de celles formulées par d’autres départements ou divisions d’UBS ou même leur être contraires.

Dans aucune circonstance, ce document ou toute information y figurant (y compris les prévisions, valeurs, indices ou autre montant calculé («Valeurs»)) ne peut être utilisé aux fins suivantes: (i) fins d’évaluation ou de comptabilisation; (ii) pour déterminer les montants dus ou payables, le prix ou la valeur d’un instrument financier ou d’un contrat financier; ou (iii) pour mesurer la performance d’un instrument financier, notamment aux fins de suivre le rendement ou la performance d’une Valeur, définir l’allocation d’actifs d’un portefeuille ou calculer les commissions de performance. Dès lors que vous avez reçu ce document et pris connaissance des informations qu’il renferme, il sera considéré que vous certifiez à UBS que vous n’utiliserez pas ce document, ou que vous ne vous appuierez pas sur lesdites informations, quelles qu’elles soient, pour aucune des fins susmentionnées. UBS et ses administrateurs ou collaborateurs peuvent être autorisés à tenir à tout moment des positions longues ou courtes dans les instruments de placement mentionnés ici, à réaliser des transactions sur des instruments de placement à titre de teneur de marché ou d’agent, ou à fournir tout autre service ou à avoir des agents qui font office d’administrateurs, soit pour l’émetteur, soit pour l’instrument de placement lui-même, soit pour toute entreprise associée sur le plan commercial ou financier auxdits émetteurs. A tout moment, les décisions de placement (y compris l’achat, la vente ou la détention de titres) prises par UBS et ses collaborateurs peuvent différer ou être contraires aux opinions exprimées dans les publications d’UBS Research. Dans le cas de certaines transactions complexes à réaliser pour cause de manque de liquidité de la valeur, il vous sera difficile d’évaluer les enjeux et de quantifier les risques auxquels vous vous exposez. UBS s’appuie sur certains dispositifs de contrôle de l’information pour contrôler le flux des informations contenues dans un ou plusieurs départements d’UBS vers d’autres départements, unités, divisions ou sociétés affiliées d’UBS. Le négoce de futures et d’options ne convient pas à tous les investisseurs parce qu’il existe un risque important de pertes et que ces pertes peuvent être supérieures à l’investissement initial. Les performances passées ne sauraient préjuger de celles à venir. Des informations complémentaires sont disponibles sur demande. Certains placements peuvent être sujets à des dépréciations soudaines et massives et, le jour du dénouement, la somme vous revenant peut être inférieure à celle que vous avez investie ou vous pouvez être contraint d’apporter des fonds supplémentaires. Les fluctuations des taux de change peuvent avoir un impact négatif sur le prix, la valeur ou le rendement d’un instrument financier. L’analyste/Les analystes responsable(s) de la préparation du présent rapport peut/peuvent interagir avec le personnel du trading desk, le personnel de vente et autres aux fins de collecte, de synthèse et d’interprétation des informations boursières.

La fiscalité dépend des circonstances spécifiques de chacun et peut faire l’objet de modifications dans le futur. UBS ne fournit pas de conseils d’ordre juridique ou fiscal et ne fait aucune déclaration sur le régime fiscal auquel les actifs ou les rendements des placements sont soumis, de manière générale ou par rapport à la situation et aux besoins spécifiques du client. Sachant qu’il nous est impossible de tenir compte des objectifs d’investissement individuels de chacun de nos clients, ni de leur situation financière ou de leurs besoins personnels, nous recommandons aux clients désireux de réaliser une transaction sur l’une des valeurs mobilières mentionnées dans ce document de s’informer auprès de leur conseiller financier ou de leur fiscaliste sur les éventuelles conséquences de cette transaction, notamment sur le plan fiscal.

Information importante relative à la stratégie d'investissement durable: les stratégies d‘investissement durable visent à prendre en considération et à intégrer les facteurs environnementaux, sociaux et de gouvernance (ESG) dans le processus d'investissement et la construction du portefeuille. Les différentes stratégies sur le plan géographique et des styles impliquent des analyses ESG et une intégration des résultats en conséquence. L'intégration de facteurs ESG ou de considérations dictées par l'investissement durable peut entraver la capacité du gestionnaire de portefeuille de saisir certaines opportunités de placement qui seraient sinon conformes à son objectif de placement et à d'autres stratégies de placement traditionnelles. Les rendements d'un portefeuille composé essentiellement d'investissements répondant aux critères ESG ou d'investissements durables peuvent être inférieurs ou supérieurs à ceux des portefeuilles qui ne tient pas compte des facteurs ESG, de critères d‘exclusion ou d'autres questions liées à l'investissement durable. En outre, dans ces portefeuilles, les opportunités d‘investissement disponibles peuvent différer. Les entreprises peuvent ne pas nécessairement satisfaire aux normes de performance élevées pour tous les aspects ESG ou toutes les questions liées aux investissements durables; en outre, il n'existe aucune garantie que les entreprises répondent aux attentes dans le domaine de la reponsabilité d'entreprise, du développement durable et/ou de la performance en termes d'impact.

Informazioni importanti sulle strategie basate sugli investimenti sostenibili: le strategie basate sugli investimenti sostenibili mirano a prendere in considerazione e integrare i fattori ambientali, sociali e di governance (ESG) nel processo d’investimento e nella costruzione del portafoglio. Le strategie più varie in termini di orientamento geografico e stile d’investimento possono effettuare analisi ESG e integrarne i risultati in diversi modi. L’inclusione dei fattori ESG o delle considerazioni alla base degli investimenti sostenibili può impedire al gestore di partecipare a certe opportunità d’investimento che altrimenti sarebbero in linea con il suo obiettivo d’investimento e con altre strategie d’investimento tradizionali. I rendimenti di un portafoglio composto essenzialmente da investimenti sostenibili possono essere superiori o inferiori a quelli di un portafoglio il cui gestore non tiene conto dei fattori ESG, non opera esclusioni e non considera altri aspetti della sostenibilità, e le opportunità d’investimento a disposizione di tali portafogli possono essere diverse. Le società possono non soddisfare necessariamente elevati standard di performance per tutti gli aspetti ESG o tutti i temi degli investimenti sostenibili; inoltre, non si garantisce che le società soddisfino le aspettative negli ambiti della responsabilità aziendale, della sostenibilità e/o della performance in termini d’impatto.

But Credit Suisse didn't want to be rescued, and UBS didn't want to have to be the rescuer.

Execs at the rival Swiss banks couldn't help but take sly digs at each other.

It's official: UBS is acquiring Credit Suisse in a historic rescue takeover.

The deal was brokered by the Swiss national bank and sealed over the course of a dramatic weekend. Two fierce domestic rivals will become one. UBS will now decide which Credit Suisse businesses it wants to keep at the bank, and which of its rival's execs could play an important role in the new UBS.

There's still much that's uncertain, but one thing's clear from how this unfolded: UBS really didn't want to have to rescue its rival, and Credit Suisse isn't thrilled with this outcome either.

The announcements and official statements around the deal were filled with technical finance jargon around liquidity support and the like, but buried beneath the details were subtweets and sly digs.

For example, the first official word of the deal came from the Swiss National Bank, which announced: ""UBS today announced the takeover of Credit Suisse."" At the time, UBS had done no such thing.

The statement went on to detail some of the extraordinary terms of the deal, saying:

""With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation.""

Next, Credit Suisse announced: ""Credit Suisse and UBS to Merge.""

A merger! Not a rescue takeover. A merger! The statement read:

""Credit Suisse and UBS have entered into a merger agreement on Sunday following the intervention of the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, the Swiss National Bank and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA (FINMA). UBS will be the surviving entity upon closing of the merger transaction.""

The wording of ""following the intervention of"" makes clear this deal was not Credit Suisse's decision. And ""UBS will be the surviving entity"" spells out that this is a takeover and not a merger.

The statement gives further clarity to the government's role, going on to say the deal came after the Swiss authorities ""asked both companies to conclude the transaction to restore necessary confidence in the stability of the Swiss economy and banking system.""

Credit Suisse's statement finished with a word from its chairman Axel Lehmann (emphasis mine):

""Given recent extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances, the announced merger represents the best available outcome. This has been an extremely challenging time for Credit Suisse and while the team has worked tirelessly to address many significant legacy issues and execute on its new strategy, we are forced to reach a solution today that provides a durable outcome.""

At this point, UBS, the bank making the acquisition in this case, had not made a statement. Normally, the acquirer is the one leading the charge in announcing a transaction. Here, it was bringing up the rear.

When UBS did make a statement, it thoroughly undermined the Credit Suisse announcement. Headline: ""UBS to acquire Credit Suisse.""

It was Colm Kelleher, UBS chairman and a veteran of the financial crisis, who delivered the coup de grâce. He said in a statement (emphasis mine):

""This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue. We have structured a transaction which will preserve the value left in the business while limiting our downside exposure.""

Credit Suisse says it's a merger. UBS says it's an emergency rescue. Ha! The UBS statement also confirmed that the takeover discussions were initiated by Swiss authorities.

Even a potential photo op marking the occasion was ruined by an awkward moment in which Kelleher waited to shake hands with Lehmann. (The two eventually did connect, for the record.)

—Peter Thal Larsen (@peter_tl) March 20, 2023

For UBS, acquiring Credit Suisse's businesses in wealth, asset management, and Swiss banking promises potential benefits. The future of Credit Suisse's investment banking business remains unclear however, with UBS promising to move the majority of its rival's markets positions to a non-core operation that would be managed down.

[Side note: The job of combining the wealth businesses will fall to Iqbal Khan, who runs UBS wealth management and used to work at Credit Suisse. In 2019, after UBS announced Khan's hire, the chief operating officer at Credit Suisse ordered a colleague to spy on him. Awkward!]

Later, on a call with analysts, Kelleher and UBS CEO Ralph Hamers defended the deal while simultaneously making it clear they themselves didn't want to do, as my colleague Rebecca Ungarino reported.

""It's a historic day in Switzerland and a day, frankly, we hoped would not come,"" Kelleher said.",['Matt Turner'],2023-03-20 00:00:00
https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/19/ubs-agrees-to-buy-credit-suisse-as-regulators-look-to-shore-up-global-banking-system.html,UBS buys Credit Suisse for $3.2 billion as regulators look to shore up the global banking system,"UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher (R) shakes hands with Credit Suisse chairman Axel Lehmann (L) after a press conference following talks over Credit Suisse in Bern on March 19, 2023.

UBS agreed to buy its embattled rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion) Sunday, with Swiss regulators playing a key part in the deal as governments looked to stem a contagion threatening the global banking system.

""With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,"" read a statement from the Swiss National Bank, which noted the central bank worked with the Swiss government and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority to bring about the combination of the country's two largest banks.

The terms of the deal will see Credit Suisse shareholders receive 1 UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares they hold.

""This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue. We have structured a transaction which will preserve the value left in the business while limiting our downside exposure,"" said UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher in a statement.

The combined bank will have $5 trillion of invested assets, according to UBS.

""We are committed to making this deal a great success. There are no options in this,"" Kelleher said when asked during the press conference if the bank could back out of the deal. ""This is absolutely essential to the financial structure of Switzerland and ... to global finance.""

The Swiss National Bank pledged a loan of up to 100 billion Swiss francs ($108 billion) to support the takeover. The Swiss government also granted a guarantee to assume losses up to 9 billion Swiss francs from certain assets over a preset threshold ""in order to reduce any risks for UBS,"" said a separate government statement.","['Ashley Capoot Katrina Bishop', 'Ashley Capoot', 'Katrina Bishop']",2023-03-19 00:00:00
https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ubs-take-over-credit-suisse-central-bank-2023-03-19/,"UBS to take over Credit Suisse, assume up to 5 billion Swiss francs in losses","













BERN, March 19 (Reuters) - UBS (UBSG.S) agreed to buy rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.23 billion) in stock and agreed to assume up to 5 billion francs ($5.4 billion) in losses, in a shotgun merger engineered by Swiss authorities to avoid more market-shaking turmoil in global banking.

The deal includes 100 billion Swiss francs ($108 billion) in liquidity assistance for UBS and Credit Suisse from the Swiss central bank.

To enable UBS to take over Credit Suisse, the federal government is providing a loss guarantee of a maximum of 9 billion Swiss francs for a clearly defined part of the portfolio, the government said.

This will be activated if losses are actually incurred on this portfolio. In that eventuality, UBS would assume the first 5 billion francs, the federal government the next 9 billion francs, and UBS would assume any further losses, the government said.

Switzerland's regulator FINMA said that there was a risk that Credit Suisse could have become ""illiquid, even if it remained solvent, and it was necessary for the authorities to take action"".

Credit Suisse Additional Tier 1 shares with a nominal value of around 16 billion francs ($17.2 billion) will be written down completely after the Swiss government provided support for UBS' takeover of Credit Suisse, FINMA said.

The 167-year-old Credit Suisse has been the biggest name ensnared in market turmoil unleashed by the recent collapse of U.S. lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, forcing it to tap $54 billion in central bank funding last week.

""With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,"" the Swiss central bank said.

Authorities had been scrambling to rescue Credit Suisse, among the world's largest wealth managers, before financial markets reopened on Monday.

UBS and Credit Suisse are both in a group of the 30 global systemically important banks watched closely by regulators, and Credit Suisse's failure would ripple throughout the entire financial system.

The announcement came in a make-or-break weekend after some rivals grew cautious in their dealings with the struggling Swiss lender, and its regulators urged it to pursue a deal with UBS.

FINMA, which said it had approved the takeover, said recent measures to stabilize itself were ""not enough to restore confidence in the bank, however, and more far-reaching options were also examined.""

The two banks' fortunes have diverged sharply over the past year. UBS earned $7.6 billion in profit in 2022, while Credit Suisse lost $7.9 billion. Credit Suisse's shares are down 74% from a year ago, while UBS's are relatively flat.

The Swiss government said that it was also giving UBS a guarantee of 9 billion Swiss francs ""assume potential losses"" from assets as part of the transaction.

UBS's chief executive officer Ralph Hamers and Chairman Colm Kelleher will remain at the helm of the combined bank.

""The transaction reinforces UBS's position as the leading universal bank in Switzerland,"" UBS said.

Executives foreshadowed structural changes in the offing.

Kelleher said it would wrap up running Credit Suisse's investment bank, but added that it was too early to say anything about potential job cuts.

Kelleher also said they would keep Credit Suisse's domestic business, despite speculation that it could be spun off amid competition concerns.

Credit Suisse's Chairman Axel Lehmann called the merger the ""best available outcome"".

FRANKFURT, March 18 (Reuters) - UBS (UBSG.S) is examining a takeover of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) that could see the Swiss government offer a guarantee against the risks involved, said two people with knowledge of the matter on Saturday.

The people said that UBS was coming under pressure from the Swiss authorities to carry out a takeover. Under the plan, Credit Suisse's Swiss business could be spun off, they added.

UBS, Credit Suisse, and Switzerland's financial regulator FINMA declined to comment when approached by Reuters.

Regulators have urged Credit Suisse Group to pursue a deal with Swiss rival UBS as the troubled bank began a make-or-break weekend after some rivals grew cautious in their dealings with it.

Credit Suisse Chief Financial Officer Dixit Joshi and his teams will hold meetings over the weekend to assess the bank's options, people with knowledge of the matter said on Friday.

The 167-year-old bank is the biggest name ensnared in the market turmoil unleashed by the collapse of U.S. lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank over the past week, forcing the Swiss bank to tap $54 billion in central bank funding.

Dating back to the mid-nineteenth century, UBS is Switzerland's biggest bank with a market value of 60 billion Swiss francs ($65 billion) and the world's largest wealth manager.

UBS itself has had its own tumultuous periods, with a clampdown on banking secrecy and a bailout during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.

It went through several restructurings, cutting thousands of jobs, and pared back the investment bank to reduce risk and improve returns.

Earlier this week, UBS Chief Executive Ralph Hamers said he was focused on organic growth rather than M&A.

Last year, he backtracked on a deal to buy Wealthfront, a $1.4 billion transaction that would have fast-tracked UBS's growth in the U.S. market. Also last year, Hamers said he expected to see more local mergers and acquisitions than cross-border consolidation in the European banking industry.

The bank this year has said the outlook is uncertain as the war in Ukraine and the surge in interest rates drags down client confidence.

The turmoil at Credit Suisse has put another dent in the Swiss reputation for financial stability on which UBS depends.

Headquartered just a few minutes' walk away from each other, not far from Lake Zurich in the centre of the city with snow-capped mountains on the horizon, the two lenders have been pillars of global finance for decades.

At the end of 2022, UBS had $2.8 trillion in invested assets in its global wealth management business and $1.1 trillion at its asset management division, both down from a year earlier.

It employs more than 72,000 people.

UBS's pretax profit of $5 billion from wealth management in 2022 dwarfed the $1.9 billion from investment banking.

UBS earned $7.1 billion in revenue from securities trading in 2022, competing with Wall Street firms in buying and selling stocks, currencies and bonds. The bank made $1.6 billion in revenue from advising on deals.

Any tie-up would be one of the biggest since the global financial crisis.

Despite a string of multiple bad calls and scandals over the last five years, Credit Suisse was among the top 30 banks to be considered ‘Global Systemically Important Banks’. In the previous eight days, the bank’s stock had lost 75% of its value and was eventually subject to a takeover bid by rival UBS in a deal supported by the Swiss government.

In this light, what does the Credit Suisse ‘bailout’ tell us about the current state of banking?

Credit Suisse to Become UBS

On Sunday, Credit Suisse issued a press release on the merger with UBS bank. According to the Financial Stability Board (FSB) that emerged from the ashes of the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, UBS is also designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).

Both Credit Suisse and UBS are headquartered in Switzerland as multinational investment banks. The merger between Credit Suisse with UBS will leave UBS as the surviving entity once the deal is finalized by the end of 2023 under these conditions:

Credit Suisse shareholders are to receive 1 UBS share for 22.48 Credit Suisse shares.

Switzerland’s central bank, the Swiss National Bank, will provide extra liquidity access to Credit Suisse during the restructuring.

Personnel from Credit Suisse will continue employment as UBS appoints new leadership and integrates the bank’s operations under UBS.

The merger took motion once UBS upped its offer to buy Credit Suisse for $3.25 billion, following the $1 billion offer rejection by the Credit Suisse board. On Friday, Credit Suisse’s closing price was CHF 1.86. Therefore, even with UBS upping its offer from 0.25 to 0.50 per share in its stock, the CS buyout was heavily discounted.

Accordingly, CS shareholders will take a significant loss as they receive CHF 0.76 in UBS shares for CS stock worth CHF 1.86 just a few days ago. Axel P. Lehmann, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse, framed the UBS-Credit Suisse merger as the best outcome:

“Given recent extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances, the announced merger represents the best available outcome.”

Indeed, Credit Suisse’s merger with UBS was underpinned by multiple unprecedented events. The ending of the 167-year-old bank was hastily arranged over the weekend, which does not bode well for consumer confidence.

Extraordinary Bailout of Credit Suisse

Also on Sunday, the Swiss National Bank issued a press release on its CHF 100 billion ($108B) to facilitate UBS’ takeover of Credit Suisse. The central bank clarified that “both banks have unrestricted access to the SNB’s existing facilities.”

A federal default guarantee backs the CHF 100 billion liquidity assistance loan. If the borrower fails to repay its obligations, the SNB commits to selling government bonds and other debt securities.

This is the first such intervention since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008.

Typically, such federal default guarantees are implicitly assumed to boost consumer confidence in the banking system. The problem is that the SNB reported an annual 2022 loss of CHF 132.5 billion ($143B). This is the deepest loss in the central bank’s 116-year history, almost all coming from foreign currency positions, at CHF 131.5 billion.

Such loss is somewhat surprising given that the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) warns explicitly that “There are many activities of banks which involve risk-taking, but there are few in which a bank may so quickly incur large losses as in foreign exchange transactions.”

Compared to a year prior, in 2021, the SNB profited from foreign currency positions at CHF 25.7 billion.

In addition to SNB’s shaky financial legs, while simultaneously providing up to CHF 100 billion as a loan for the UBS-Credit Suisse merger, law-tweaking was also needed. Under normal circumstances, UBS shareholders had to vote on the merger, which had been circumvented before Monday.

“I have never seen such measures taken; it shows how bad the situation is.” Vincent Kaufmann, CEO of Ethos Foundation, representing Swiss pension funds.

The abrupt law change by the Swiss government makes the UBS-Credit Suisse merger one of a kind.

The Credit Suisse Collapse Rife with Omens

Last November, Credit Suisse estimated a $1.6 billion loss in Q4 following a sustained $88.3 billion bank run. In 2022, the bank suffered CHF 160 billion ($173 billion) deposit exodus, with CHF 111 billion just for Q4.

It was no coincidence that CS’s deposit withdrawals have ramped up since 2020. Early that year, CS CEO Tidjane Thiam had to resign after a spying scandal came into the public spotlight. It turned out that the bank hired private investigators to spy on CS’s former wealth management head, Iqbal Kahn, following his departure to competitive UBS.

The spy scandal resulted in the suicide of one of the private investigators.

After Thomas Gottstein took the CS reins in February 2020, he lasted until July 2022. The following month, CS was found guilty of money laundering assets belonging to the Bulgarian mafia from the decade prior. Although the fine was tiny, at $2.1 million, CS became the first major Swiss bank involved in such criminal proceedings.

However, the lack of due diligence by CS was far more damaging. In April 2021, the bank found itself in a $4.7 billion bind following the machinations of “Bill Hwang’s” Archegos Capital. Altogether, Credit Suisse managed to fashion public perception as the bank riddled with cultural rot.

https://seekingalpha.com/news/3948706-ubs-confirms-deal-to-acquire-credit-suisse-for-325b-in-stock,UBS confirms deal to acquire Credit Suisse for $3.25B in stock (NYSE:CS),"UBS (NYSE:UBS) confirmed on Sunday that it agreed to acquire struggling Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) for a total of CHF 3B (US$3.25B) in a stock-based transaction that also provides downside protection for the larger UBS. The deal was struck in an effort ""to restore necessary confidence in the stability of the Swiss economy and banking system,"" Credit Suisse said.

The transaction, the result of a Swiss government-led negotiation, has the full support of Swiss Federal Department of Finance, Finma, and the Swiss National Bank.

Under the terms of the agreement, Credit Suisse (CS) shareholders will get one UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares, equivalent to CHF 0.76/share. Credit Suisse shares last traded at CHF 1.86 in Zurich on Friday.

""UBS (UBS) benefits from CHF 25 billion of downside protection from the transaction to support marks, purchase price adjustments and restructuring costs, and additional 50% downside protection on non-core assets,"" UBS said. In addition, both banks have unrestricted access to the Swiss National Bank existing facilities, which can provide liquidity to them according to guidelines on monetary policy instruments.

On Sunday, Credit Suisse (CS) was informed that Finma has determined that Credit Suisse's Additional Tier 1 Capital in the aggregate nominal amount of ~CHF 16B will be written off to zero.

The combination of the two banks is expected to generate annual run-rate of cost reductions of more than $8B by 2027. UBS (UBS) expects the deal to add to EPS by 2027 and the bank remains capitalized well above its target of 13%.

The transaction isn't subject to shareholder approval. UBS (UBS) has obtained pre-agreement from Finma, Switzerland's financial markets authority; Swiss National Bank; the Swiss Federal Department of Finance and other core regulators.

That unusual provision is likely to trigger legal and political resistance, said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of management consultancy Opimas. ""First, the Federal Council has made use of emergency powers to force this merger through. A legal challenge by Credit Suisse shareholders, who will claim that their property has been illegally confiscated, is guaranteed.""

UBS (UBS) shareholders may also protest the transaction, as risk from Credit Suisse (CS) ""could prove to be a mill stone around UBS’ neck that will drag both banks under,"" he added.

Overall, the government-sponsored deal has ramifications for other Swiss Financial institutions, Marenzi said. ""A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away.""

Credit Suisse (CS) said it continues to operate in the ordinary course of business and implement its restructuring in collaboration with UBS (UBS).

The combination increases UBS's lead in its Swiss home market and creates a leading global wealth manager with $5T of invested assets across the group, UBS (UBS) said. Its strategy remains unchanged, including its focus on growth in the Americas and Asia-Pacific.

""The transaction reinforces UBS’s position as the leading universal bank in Switzerland. The combined businesses will be a leading asset manager in Europe, with invested assets of more than USD 1.5T,"" the company said.

Management will hold an analyst call at 10 PM CET (5:00 PM ET).

Credit Suisse (CS) Chairman Axel P. Lehmann said, ""Given recent extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances, the announced merger represents the best available outcome.""

UBS shares staged a remarkable rally Monday afternoon, reversing steep losses after the bank's 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.2 billion) ""emergency rescue"" of embattled domestic rival Credit Suisse .

Shares of UBS closed 1.2% higher, recovering from losses of over 14% at one point in the session. Credit Suisse, meanwhile, closed more than 55% lower.

Europe's banking index rose 1.2% by the end of the session, recouping earlier losses as a sense of calm appeared to return to markets.

The volatility comes shortly after UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse as part of a cut-price deal in an effort to stem the risk of contagion to the global banking system.

Swiss authorities and regulators helped to facilitate the deal, announced Sunday, as Credit Suisse teetered on the brink.

The size of Credit Suisse was a concern for the banking system, as was its global footprint given its multiple international subsidiaries. The 167-year-old bank's balance sheet is around twice the size of Lehman Brothers' when it collapsed, at about 530 billion Swiss francs at the end of last year.

The combined bank will be a massive lender, with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets and ""sustainable value opportunities,"" UBS said in a release late Sunday.

The bank's chairman, Colm Kelleher, said the acquisition was ""attractive"" for UBS shareholders but clarified that ""as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue.""

""We have structured a transaction which will preserve the value left in the business while limiting our downside exposure,"" he added in a statement.

GENEVA -- Banking giant UBS is buying troubled rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion, in a deal orchestrated by regulators in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in the global banking system.

Swiss authorities pushed for UBS to take over its smaller rival after a plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and the bank’s customers. Shares of Credit Suisse and other banks plunged this week after the failure of two banks in the U.S. sparked concerns about other potentially shaky institutions in the global financial system.

Credit Suisse is among the 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

The deal was “one of great breadth for the stability of international finance,"" said Swiss President Alain Berset as he announced it Sunday night. ""An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.”

Switzerland's executive branch, a seven-member governing body that includes Berset, passed an emergency ordinance allowing the merger to go through without shareholder approval.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann called the sale “a clear turning point.”

“It is a historic, sad and very challenging day for Credit Suisse, for Switzerland and for the global financial markets,” Lehmann said, adding that the focus is now on the future and in particular on the 50,000 Credit Suisse employees, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland.

Following news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated financial moves to stabilize banks in the coming week. This includes daily access to a lending facility for banks looking to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice which widely used during the 2008 financial crisis. Three months after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September of 2008, such swap lines had been tapped for $580 billion. Added swap lines were also rolled out during market turmoil in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in March of 2020.

“Today is one of the most significant days in European banking since 2008, with far-reaching repercussions for the industry,"" said Max Georgiou, an analyst at Third Bridge. “These events could alter the course of not only European banking but also the wealth management industry more generally.”

Colm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed the “enormous opportunities” that emerge from the takeover, and highlighted his bank’s “conservative risk culture” — a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse's reputation for more swashbuckling, aggressive gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said the council ""regrets that the bank, which was once a model institution in Switzerland and part of our strong location, was able to get into this situation at all.”

The combination of the two biggest and best-known Swiss banks, each with storied histories dating to the mid-19th century, amounts to a thunderclap for Switzerland’s reputation as a global financial center — leaving it on the cusp of having a single national champion in banking.

The deal follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further panic. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse’s share price began plummeting this week.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde lauded the “swift action” by Swiss officials, saying they were “instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.”

She said the banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.

UBS officials said they plan to sell off parts of Credit Suisse or reduce the bank's size in the coming months and years.

The Swiss government is providing more than 100 billion francs in aid and financial backstops to make the deal go through.

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out. European bank regulators use a special type of bond designed to provide a capital cushion to banks in times of distress. But these bonds are designed to be wiped out if a bank’s capital falls below a certain level, which was triggered as part of this government-brokered deal.

Berset said the Federal Council had already been discussing a long-troubled situation at Credit Suisse since the beginning of the year and held urgent meetings in the last four days amid spiraling concerns about its financial health that caused major swoons in its stock price and raised the specter of the 2007-08 financial crisis.

Investors and banking industry analysts were still digesting the deal, but at least one analyst was sour on the news because it could damage Switzerland’s global banking image.

“A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,” said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas LLC, in an email.

Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

The Credit Suisse parent bank is not part of European Union supervision, but it has entities in several European countries that are. Lagarde reiterated what she said last week after the central bank raised interest rates — that the European banking sector is resilient, with strong financial reserves and plenty of ready cash.

Many of Credit Suisse’s problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.

The deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn't invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.

On Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.

Its current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.

While smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.

The Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

UBS has agreed to acquire Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion). The government-brokered deal aims to calm jittery investors and depositors, and halt the burgeoning banking crisis before it spirals out of control.

The planned mega-merger is just the latest development in a dramatic couple of weeks. Three US banks have folded, regulators have rushed to contain the fallout with emergency measures, and Warren Buffett has reportedly spoken to senior White House officials about potentially stepping in to save the day.

The Swiss agreement has major implications for US investors. They range from its impact on financial markets and the banking sector, to its potential effect on the American economy and interest rates.

Here's a closer look at what the deal could mean.

What pressures led to the deal?

Credit Suisse has faced a series of scandals in recent years, ranging from bad bets to corporate espionage. Recently, the Swiss banking giant revealed there were ""material weaknesses"" in its financial reporting.

Investors got worried it could be caught up in the turmoil driven by the US bank failures. Their reaction tanked its stock and bonds, and drove up the cost of insuring against the bank defaulting on its debt.

Swiss authorities determined the lender was at risk, and pushed UBS to acquire it. The Swiss National Bank has agreed to lend UBS the equivalent of $108 billion to help it see through the merger.

Meanwhile, Switzerland's financial regulator has wiped out $17 billion worth of Credit Suisse bonds and removed the need for UBS shareholders to approve the transaction.

What does it say about the threat to banks right now?

Swiss officials' involvement in the deal, and the substantial sweeteners they've provided to make it happen, suggest they're deeply concerned about the ongoing banking crisis.

Those growing worries are reflected in the concerted effort taken by the US Federal Reserve and other central banks at the weekend. They've come together to help foreign banks get access to US dollars by offering swap operations every day through April, rather than once a week.

The mega-takeover also has clear parallels with the banking deals sealed during and after the 2008 financial crisis. That's when JP Morgan scooped up Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, Bank of America acquired Merrill Lynch, and Wells Fargo bought Wachovia.

If more deals lead to more consolidation in the banking industry, that could reflect pressures on smaller lenders are growing, forcing them to seek safety in the arms of larger, wealthier peers.

What sparked the concerns about banks?

The current turmoil was touched off by Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and Silvergate all shutting down in the past couple of weeks.

In SVB's case, it ran into trouble because it had a high percentage of uninsured deposits. It also invested in long-dated bonds that have plunged in price over the past year, as the Fed hiked interest rates.

The bank's cash-hungry, venture-capital-backed customers rushed to pull their money out after SVB sold bonds at a loss and tried to raise fresh capital. They were worried the bank could fail, and they would lose most of their cash.

The wave of withdrawals overwhelmed the bank, spurring the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) to take control and later guarantee all of its deposits. The FDIC also took the same action at Signature, while Silvergate voluntarily closed down.

Meanwhile, the Fed established an emergency lending program to help banks easily access capital to weather any further pressures.

The banks' challenges, and authorities' efforts so far in response to them, made investors sour on global banks, paving the way for UBS to acquire Credit Suisse.

How could the Swiss deal affect markets?

Governments worldwide will be hoping the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse will calm fears about the chance of more bank failures. The Swiss government's ""whatever it takes"" approach could also help restore faith in the financial system.

But investors could interpret the rushed deal — seen as a bailout by some — as a sign of desperation in the face of a real threat to vulnerable banks.

On Monday morning, UBS shares slumped 7% and the Euro Stoxx Bank Index slid 1%. That suggest the Swiss bank's shareholders aren't impressed by the deal terms, and that the market isn't reassured about the prospects for other lenders.

What does the transaction mean for the US economy and interest rates?

The UBS-Credit Suisse deal may be a mixed blessing for Americans. It could help to cool inflation, but might also raise the odds of a recession.

US inflation spiked to a 40-year high last year, spurring the Fed to lift interest rates from nearly zero to upwards of 4.5% over the past 12 months — and it could raise them again at its meeting this week.

Rate hikes help curb price increases as they make borrowing more costly and encourage people to save instead of spend. But at the same time, they can dampen consumer demand and weigh on the prices of stocks and other assets. They can also lift the risk of a recession by pushing unemployment higher.

Americans could see the UBS-Credit Suisse deal as evidence of serious underlying problems in banks and the wider financial system.

As a result, they might become more conservative in their spending, investing, and hiring — and that might not change until they're certain more banks aren't going to fail. They need to be reassured they aren't going to lose their jobs or suffer a big blow to their retirement savings.

That could help the Fed in its inflation fight, but might pose to a risk to financial stability and employment — two other priorities for the central bank.

Fed officials could face a situation where they want to hike rates further to crush inflation, but doing so could heap further pressure on lenders and exacerbate the banking crisis, increasing the risk of a broader economic downturn.

What does this all mean for the current banking crisis?

American investors may well see the UBS-Credit Suisse deal as evidence of a mad scramble to shore up liquidity among lenders and combine different banks.

Also, they may view it as a harbinger of more bad news to come — the first in a wave of tie-ups. That's especially a risk given how things played out during the financial crisis.

That means US stockpickers and bondholders will be watching for more red flags at domestic banks. They're also likely to keep a close eye on what the authorities do next, to gauge just how serious the current challenges are.

Without an unlimited blanket guarantee on bank deposits, it's easy to imagine customers will be wary that more banks could fail. They could seek to park their funds in safer places.

The turmoil could weaken inflationary pressures by leading banks to tighten their lending, and by confidence among consumers and businesses.

But it could also mean the Fed faces a double whammy: stubborn inflation against a backdrop of fragile growth and employment.

That would give it an impossible choice: halt its interest rate hikes and let prices keep rising, or march foward with rate increases that threaten to ramp up pressure on banks and drag the economy into a recession.

In short, there are several reasons to think the UBS-Credit Suisse merger could spook investors and exacerbate the banking crisis.",['Theron Mohamed'],2023-03-20 00:00:00

UBS has become depositors' most secure bet, TD Cowen's Jaret Seiberg told CNBC, after it agreed to take over Credit Suisse on Sunday.

The bank is set to acquire its Swiss counterpart in a $3.2 billion acquisition deal. The government-backed arrangement is an attempt to settle investors' anxiety, after Credit Suisse couldn't stem deposit outflows amid uncertainty about its liquidity and debt holdings.

""I think right now UBS has to be the world's safest bank,"" Seiberg said Monday, referring to its depositors. ""The Swiss authorities have told everybody that this thing is too big to fail.""

Together, UBS and Credit Suisse will share around $5 trillion in assets. US-listed shares of UBS were up nearly 4% on Monday. Meanwhile, Credit Suisse stock continued to tumble, diving by over 60% as terms of the all-stock takeover entailed a near-wipeout for shareholders.

The news also comes alongside another bank acquisition over the weekend: Signature Bank, one of the two regional lenders seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. over a week ago, had also found a buyer.

The third-largest bank failure after Silicon Valley Bank before it, Signature will now be in the hands of Flagstar Bank, which acquired all of its deposits and branches, as well as some of its loans.

The deal comes after the FDIC said it will guarantee all deposits at Signature and SVB, even those that exceed its $250,000 limit.

But Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen acknowledged to Congress on Thursday that, unlike SVB and Signature Bank, not all deposits exceeding the $250,000 limit will be guaranteed in the future.

For now, bank profits and net interest margins remain healthy, Seiberg said, and unlimited deposit backstops represent more of a ""break the glass emergency option.""

""What we really have is a crisis of confidence,"" he added. ""Unlimited deposit insurance is the final act to restore confidence, but I'm not sure it's needed today.""",['Filip De Mott'],2023-03-20 00:00:00

The last-minute rescue of Credit Suisse may have prevented the current banking crisis from exploding, but it’s a raw deal for Switzerland.

Worries that Credit Suisse’s downfall would spark a broader banking meltdown left Swiss regulators with few good options. A tie-up with its larger rival, UBS (UBS), offered the best chance of restoring stability in the banking sector globally and in Switzerland, and protecting the Swiss economy in the near term.

But it leaves Switzerland exposed to a single massive financial institution, even as there is still huge uncertainty over how successful the mega merger will prove to be.

“One of the most established facts in academic research is that bank mergers hardly ever work,” said Arturo Bris, a professor of finance at Swiss business school IMD.

There are also concerns that the deal will lead to huge job losses in Switzerland and weaken competition in the country’s vital financial sector, which overall employs more than 5% of the national workforce, or nearly 212,000 people.

Taxpayers, meanwhile, are now on the hook for up to 9 billions Swiss francs ($9.8 billion) of future potential losses at UBS arising from certain Credit Suisse assets, provided those losses exceed 5 billion francs ($5.4 billion). The state has also explicitly guaranteed a 100 billion Swiss franc ($109 billion) lifeline to UBS, should it need it, although that would be repayable.

Switzerland’s Social Democratic party has already called for an investigation into what went wrong at Credit Suisse, arguing that the newly created “super-megabank” increases risks for the Swiss economy.

The demise of one of Switzerland’s oldest institutions has come as a shock to many of its citizens. Credit Suisse is “part of Switzerland’s identity,” said Hans Gersbach, a professor of macroeconomics at ETH university in Zurich. The bank “has been instrumental in the development of modern Switzerland.”

Its collapse has also tainted Switzerland’s reputation as a safe and stable global financial center, particularly after the government effectively stripped shareholders of voting rights to get the deal done.

Swiss authorities also wiped out some bondholders ahead of shareholders, upending the traditional hierarchy of losses in a bank failure and dealing another blow to the country’s reputation among investors.

“The repercussions for Switzerland are terrible,” said Bris of IMD. “For a start, the reputation of Switzerland has been damaged forever.”

That will benefit other wealth management centers, including Singapore, he told CNN. Singaporeans are “celebrating… because there is going to be a huge inflow of funds into other wealth management jurisdictions.”

Too big to fail?

At roughly $1.7 trillion, the combined assets of the new entity amount to double the size of Switzerland’s annual economic output. By deposits and loans to Swiss customers, UBS will now be bigger than the next two local banks combined.

With a roughly 30% market share in Swiss banking, “we see too much concentration risk and market share control,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note last week before the deal was done. They suggested that the combined entity would need to exit or IPO some businesses.

The problem with having one single large bank in a small economy is that if it faces a bank run or needs a bailout — which UBS did during the 2008 crisis — the government’s financial firepower may be insufficient.

At 333 billion francs ($363 billion), local deposits in the new entity equal 45% of GDP — an enormous amount even for a country with healthy public finances and low levels of debt.

On the other hand, UBS is in a much stronger financial position than it was during the 2008 crisis and it will be required to build up an even bigger financial buffer as a result of the deal. The Swiss financial regulator, FINMA, has said it will “very closely monitor the transaction and compliance with all requirements under supervisory law.”

UBS chairman Colm Kelleher underscored the health of UBS’s balance sheet Sunday at a press conference on the deal. “Having been chief financial officer [at Morgan Stanley] during the last global financial crisis, I’m well aware of the importance of a solid balance sheet. UBS will remain rock-solid,” he said.

Kelleher added that UBS would trim Credit Suisse’s investment bank “and align it with our conservative risk culture.”

Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said “the question of market concentration in Switzerland is something to address in future.” “30% [market share] is higher than you might ideally want but not so high that it’s a major problem.”

The deal has “surgically removed the most worrying part of [Switzerland’s] banking system,” leaving it stronger, Kenningham added.

Jobs and competition

The deal will have an adverse affect on jobs, though, likely adding to the 9,000 cuts that Credit Suisse already announced as part of an earlier turnaround plan.

For Switzerland, the threat is acute. The two banks collectively employ more than 37,000 people in the country, about 18% of the financial sector’s workforce, and there is bound to be overlap.

“The Credit Suisse branch in the city where I live is right in front of UBS’s, meaning one of the two will certainly close,” Bris of IMD wrote in a note Monday.

In a call with analysts Sunday night, UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said the bank would try to remove 8 billion francs ($8.9 billion) of costs a year by 2027, 6 billion francs ($6.5 billion) of which would come from reducing staff numbers.

“We are clearly cognizant of Swiss societal and economic factors. We will be considerate employers, but we need to do this in a rational way,” Kelleher told reporters.

Not only does the deal, done in a hurry, fail to protect jobs in Switzerland, but it contains no special provisions on competition issues.

UBS now has “quasi-monopoly power,” which could increase the cost of banking services in the country, according to Bris.

Although Switzerland has dozens of smaller regional and savings banks, including 24 cantonal banks, UBS is now an even more dominant player. “Everything they do… will influence the market,” said Gersbach of ETH.

Credit Suisse’s Swiss banking arm, arguably its crown jewel, could have been subject to a future sale as part of the terms of the deal, he added.

A spinoff of the domestic bank now looks unlikely, however, after UBS made clear that it intended to hold onto it. “The Credit Suisse Swiss bank is a fine asset that we are very determined to keep,” Kelleher said Sunday.

Integration is difficult

At $3.25 billion, UBS got Credit Suisse for 60% less than the bank was worth when markets closed two days prior. Whether that ultimately turns out to be a steal remains to be seen. Large mergers are notoriously fraught with risk and often don’t deliver the promised returns to shareholders.

UBS argues that by expanding its global wealth and asset management franchise, the deal will drive long-term shareholder value. “UBS’s strength and our familiarity with Credit Suisse’s business puts us in a unique position to execute this integration efficiently and effectively,” Kelleher said. UBS expects the deal to increase its profit by 2027.

The transaction is expected to close in the coming months, but fully integrating the two institutions will take three to five years, according to Phillip Straley, the president of data analytics company FNA. “There’s a huge amount of integration risk,” he said.

Moody’s on Tuesday affirmed its credit ratings on UBS but changed the outlook on some of its debt from stable to negative, judging that the “complexity, extent and duration of the integration” posed risks to the bank.

It pointed to challenges retaining key Credit Suisse staff, minimizing the loss of overlapping clients in Switzerland and unifying the cultures of “two somewhat different organizations.”

According to Kenningham of Capital Economics, the “track record of shotgun marriages in the banking sector is mixed.”

“Some, such as the 1995 purchase of Barings by ING, have proved long-lasting. But others, including several during the global financial crisis, soon brought into question the viability of the acquiring bank, while others have proven very difficult to implement.”",['Hanna Ziady'],2023-03-23 00:00:00

Colm Kelleher, UBS

Kelleher said in a press conference on 19 March that a framework of support has been agreed with the Swiss regulators, which ensures a successful “integration” in the best interests of Switzerland and protects shareholders. The deal is not subject to shareholder approval, and is awaiting final regulatory approvals which he said should take weeks or months.

He added: “This transaction confirms and augments our strategy of growing our capital-light businesses. Let me be very specific, UBS intends to downsize Credit Suisse’s investment banking business and align it with our conservative risk culture.”

UBS intends that the combined investment banking businesses will, over time, account for no more than 25% of the group’s risk weighted assets. Kelleher stressed that UBS has a capital light model and will be derisking the investment bank in order to focus on its model of asset and wealth management. He said the combination of the two banks will further strengthen UBS’s position as a leading global wealth manager with more than $5 trillion in assets operating in the most attractive growth markets according to Kelleher.

“Having been chief financial officer during the last global financial crisis, and well aware of the importance of a solid balance sheet, especially in challenging times like these, a new UBS will remain rock solid,” he added .

Ralph Hamers, chief executive of UBS, will be group CEO of the combined entity and Kelleher will continue in his role as chairman.

“I am pleased that this transaction will bring the long desired stability for the Credit Suisse client base,” Kelleher added. “We’re well aware that the coming weeks and months will be difficult for many, especially for the employees. Let me reassure you that we will do our utmost to keep this time of uncertainty as short as possible.”

Axel Lehmann, chair of Credit Suisse, said in the press conference that it was a historic moment and a sad and very challenging day for Credit Suisse. He continued that Ulrich Körner, chief executive of Credit Suisse, took on the role about seven months ago, and despite his leadership team achieving many of their objectives, they did not have time to conclude the project.

A reporter asks Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann: ""Who is responsible for this disaster?"" https://t.co/6getChRaKN pic.twitter.com/yYJ22t5xOl — Bloomberg (@business) March 19, 2023

He described the massive outflows of client deposits in October last year as a huge downturn. However, Credit Suisse managed to overcome the loss of confidence and started 2023 with a lot of enthusiasm and energy. However, it could not overcome the loss of confidence a second time.

“The downward spiral and the situation over the last few days made it clear that Credit Suisse cannot exist in the same way going forward,” added Lehmann. “The decisions were not easy but the solution presented is the best possible under the current circumstances.”

Lehmann said the firm has a clear focus on its 50,000 employees, of which 17,000 are in Switzerland. Kelleher said it was far too early to comment of job losses, but there will also be opportunities in the new firm.

A focused Investment Bank, remaining committed to UBS’s model; strategic Global Banking businesses to be retained, majority of Credit Suisse markets positions moved to non-core

UBS plans to acquire Credit Suisse. The combination is expected to create a business with more than USD 5 trillion in total invested assets and sustainable value opportunities. It will further strengthen UBS’s position as the leading Swiss-based global wealth manager with more than USD 3.4 trillion in invested assets on a combined basis, operating in the most attractive growth markets.

The transaction reinforces UBS’s position as the leading universal bank in Switzerland. The combined businesses will be a leading asset manager in Europe, with invested assets of more than USD 1.5 trillion.

UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said: “This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue. We have structured a transaction which will preserve the value left in the business while limiting our downside exposure. Acquiring Credit Suisse’s capabilities in wealth, asset management and Swiss universal banking will augment UBS’s strategy of growing its capital-light businesses. The transaction will bring benefits to clients and create long-term sustainable value for our investors.”

UBS Chief Executive Officer Ralph Hamers said: “Bringing UBS and Credit Suisse together will build on UBS’s strengths and further enhance our ability to serve our clients globally and deepen our best-in-class capabilities. The combination supports our growth ambitions in the Americas and Asia while adding scale to our business in Europe, and we look forward to welcoming our new clients and colleagues across the world in the coming weeks.”

The discussions were initiated jointly by the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, FINMA and the Swiss National Bank and the acquisition has their full support.

Under the terms of the all-share transaction, Credit Suisse shareholders will receive 1 UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares held, equivalent to CHF 0.76/share for a total consideration of CHF 3 billion. UBS benefits from CHF 25 billion of downside protection from the transaction to support marks, purchase price adjustments and restructuring costs, and additional 50% downside protection on non-core assets. Both banks have unrestricted access to the Swiss National Bank existing facilities, through which they can obtain liquidity from the SNB in accordance with the guidelines on monetary policy instruments.

The combination of the two businesses is expected to generate annual run-rate of cost reductions of more than USD 8 billion by 2027.

UBS Investment Bank will reinforce its global competitive position with institutional, corporate and wealth management clients through the acceleration of strategic goals in Global Banking while managing down the rest of Credit Suisse’s Investment Bank. The combined investment banking businesses accounts for approximately 25% of Group risk weighted assets.

UBS anticipates that the transaction is EPS accretive by 2027 and the bank remains capitalized well above its target of 13%.

Colm Kelleher will be Chairman and Ralph Hamers will be Group CEO of the combined entity.

The transaction is not subject to shareholder approval. UBS has obtained pre-agreement from FINMA, Swiss National Bank, Swiss Federal Department of Finance and other core regulators on the timely approval of the transaction.

Credit Suisse statement

Credit Suisse and UBS have entered into a merger agreement on Sunday following the intervention of the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, the Swiss National Bank and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA (FINMA). UBS will be the surviving entity upon closing of the merger transaction. Under the terms of the merger agreement all shareholders of Credit Suisse will receive 1 share in UBS for 22.48 shares in Credit Suisse. Until consummation of the merger, Credit Suisse will continue to conduct its business in the ordinary course and implement its restructuring measures in collaboration with UBS. The Swiss National Bank will grant Credit Suisse access to facilities that provide substantial additional liquidity. On March 19, 2023, Swiss Federal Department of Finance, the Swiss National Bank and FINMA have asked Credit Suisse and UBS to enter into the merger agreement. Pursuant to the emergency ordinance which is being issued by the Swiss Federal Council, the merger can be implemented without approval of the shareholders. The consummation of the merger remains subject to customary closing conditions.

Credit Suisse and UBS have entered into a merger agreement on Sunday with UBS being the surviving entity. After negotiations that took place during the weekend leading up to the signing of the merger agreement, UBS and Credit Suisse concluded that it would be in the best interest of their shareholders and their stakeholders to enter into the merger. This move comes after the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, the Swiss National Bank and FINMA asked both companies to conclude the transaction to restore necessary confidence in the stability of the Swiss economy and banking system.

The merger transaction provides for the following key terms:

All shareholders of Credit Suisse will receive 1 share in UBS for 22.48 shares in Credit Suisse as merger consideration. This exchange ratio reflects a merger consideration of CHF 3 billion for all shares in Credit Suisse.

The merger transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions. Both parties are confident that all conditions can be met. The merger is expected to be consummated by end of 2023 if possible.

The Swiss National Bank will grant Credit Suisse access to facilities that provide substantial additional liquidity.

For the purpose of a seamless integration of Credit Suisse into UBS, UBS is expected to appoint key personnel to Credit Suisse as soon as legally possible.

Credit Suisse continues to operate in the ordinary course of business and implement its restructuring measures in collaboration with UBS.

UBS has expressed its confidence that the employment of the staff of Credit Suisse will be continued.

On Sunday, Credit Suisse has been informed by FINMA that FINMA has determined that Credit Suisse’s Additional Tier 1 Capital (deriving from the issuance of Tier 1 Capital Notes) in the aggregate nominal amount of approximately CHF 16 billion will be written off to zero.

In consideration of the unique circumstances affecting the Swiss economy as a whole, the Swiss Federal Council is issuing an emergency ordinance (Notverordnung) tailored to this particular transaction. Most importantly, the merger will be implemented without the otherwise necessary approval of the shareholders of UBS and Credit Suisse to enhance deal certainty.

Axel P. Lehmann, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse said: “Given recent extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances, the announced merger represents the best available outcome. This has been an extremely challenging time for Credit Suisse and while the team has worked tirelessly to address many significant legacy issues and execute on its new strategy, we are forced to reach a solution today that provides a durable outcome.”",['Shanny Basar'],2023-03-20 01:29:00-04:00

S&P lowers First Republic Bank’s credit rating















March 19 (Reuters) - Some of the world's largest central banks came together on Sunday to stop a banking crisis from spreading as Swiss authorities persuaded UBS Group AG (UBSG.S) to buy rival Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S) in a historic deal.

UBS will pay 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.23 billion) for 167-year-old Credit Suisse and assume up to $5.4 billion in losses in a deal backed by a massive Swiss guarantee and expected to close by the end of 2023.

Soon after the announcement late on Sunday, the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and other major central banks came out with statements to reassure markets that have been walloped by a banking crisis that started with the collapse of two regional U.S. banks earlier this month.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures were each up 0.4%, both giving back some earlier gains. New Zealand dipped at the open and Australian shares (.AXJO) opened with a 0.5% loss. The safe-haven dollar lost ground against Sterling and the euro but was up versus the yen.

Pressure on UBS helped seal Sunday's deal.

""It's a historic day in Switzerland, and a day frankly, we hoped, would not come,"" UBS Chair Colm Kelleher told analysts on a conference call. ""I would like to make it clear that while we did not initiate discussions, we believe that this transaction is financially attractive for UBS shareholders,"" Kelleher said.

UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said there were still many details to be worked through.

""I know that there must be still questions that we have not been able to answer,"" he said. ""And I understand that and I even want to apologize for it.""

In a global response not seen since the height of the pandemic, the Fed said it had joined with central banks in Canada, England, Japan, the EU and Switzerland in a coordinated action to enhance market liquidity. The ECB vowed to support euro zone banks with loans if needed, adding the Swiss rescue of Credit Suisse was ""instrumental"" for restoring calm.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen welcomed the announcement by the Swiss authorities. The Bank of England also praised the Swiss.

“The greater risk environment for financials leads to husbanding of capital and risk-taking, less and more conservative investing and lending, and inevitably, lower growth,"" said Lloyd Blankfein, former chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N).

""While some banks have been hung up by poorly managed, concentrated risk, the overall banking system is extremely well capitalized and substantially more tightly regulated than in prior challenging times.”

The Swiss banking marriage follows efforts in Europe and the United States to support the sector since the collapse of U.S. lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.

Some investors welcomed the weekend steps but took a cautious stance.

""Provided markets don’t sniff out other lingering problems, I’d think this should be pretty positive,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments.

Problems remain in the U.S. banking sector, where bank stocks remained under pressure despite a move by several large banks to deposit $30 billion into First Republic Bank (FRC.N), an institution rocked by the failures of Silicon Valley and Signature Bank.

On Sunday, First Republic saw its credit ratings downgraded deeper into junk status by S&P Global, which said the deposit infusion may not solve its liquidity problems.

U.S. bank deposits have stabilized, with outflows slowing or stopping and in some cases reversing, a U.S. official said on Sunday, adding the problems of Credit Suisse are unrelated to recent deposit runs on U.S. banks and that U.S. banks have limited exposure to Credit Suisse.

The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC), meanwhile, is planning to relaunch the sale process for Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB.O), with the regulator seeking a potential breakup of the lender, according to people familiar with the matter.

'DECISIVE INTERVENTION'

The intervention comes after two sources told Reuters earlier on Sunday that major banks in Europe were looking to the Fed and ECB to step in with stronger signals of support to stem contagion.

The euro , the pound and the Australian dollar all rose by around 0.4% against the greenback, indicating a degree of risk appetite in markets.

""Bank stocks should rally on the news, but it is premature to signal all-clear,"" said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer for Angeles Investments in California.

UBS Chair Colm Kelleher said during a press conference that it will wind down Credit Suisse's investment bank, which has thousands of employees worldwide. UBS said it expected annual cost savings of some $7 billion by 2027.

The Swiss central bank said Sunday's deal includes 100 billion Swiss francs ($108 billion) in liquidity assistance for UBS and Credit Suisse.

Credit Suisse shareholders will receive 1 UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares held, equivalent to 0.76 Swiss francs per share for a total consideration of 3 billion francs, UBS said.

Credit Suisse shares had lost a quarter of their value last week. The bank was forced to tap $54 billion in central bank funding as it tries to recover from scandals that have undermined confidence.

Under the deal with UBS, some Credit Suisse bondholders are major losers. The Swiss regulator decided that Credit Suisse bonds with a notional value of $17 billion will be valued at zero, angering some of the holders of the debt who thought they would be better protected than shareholders in a rescue deal announced on Sunday.

UBS, formerly known as the Union Bank of Switzerland, is a multinational diversified financial services company headquartered in Zurich and Basel. UBS is involved in virtually all major financial activities, including retail and commercial banking, investment banking, investment management, and wealth management.

UBS has a major presence around the globe and in the United States. It has its American headquarters in New York City. It operates in over 50 countries worldwide, with close to 60,000 employees.

Key Takeaways UBS is a Swiss investment bank with global operations.

In March 2023, UBS (UBS) announced it would absorb Credit Suisse (CS) in a $2 billion all stock deal brokered by the government to prevent the latter embattled bank from failing.

The main divisions of UBS include investment & retail banking and asset & wealth management.

Its retail banking sector facilitates private Swiss bank accounts.

The company has approximately USD $3.2 trillion in assets under management.

UBS Explained

The name UBS is derived from one of its predecessor corporations, the Union Bank of Switzerland. The current UBS originated when the Union Bank of Switzerland merged with the Swiss Bank Corporation in 1998. Thus, UBS is now used as the company's official name and not as an acronym.

The UBS logo consists of three keys, a symbol taken from the Swiss Bank Corporation. The keys symbolize confidence, security, and discretion.

UBS’s Major Divisions

UBS has several major divisions, offering products and services to numerous clients. These divisions include wealth management, asset management, investment banking, and retail banking.

Wealth Management

UBS wealth management covers both high net worth and ultra-high net-worth individuals. The division’s financial advisors work with clients to understand the breadth of their financial and other assets and develop tailored solutions to meet their needs. Financial advisors may specialize in services, such as investment management, income tax preparation, or estate planning.

Asset Management

The investment aim of UBS asset management is to “deliver superior investment performance and client service.” Asset management differs from wealth management in that it can also describe managing collective investments (such as a pension fund) in addition to overseeing individual assets. For this reason, some deem asset management to encompass wealth management.

UBS has more than CHF 2.8 trillion in invested assets in 2022 and is the largest bank in Switzerland.

Investment Banking

UBS investment bank is considered one of the bulge bracket banks, along with Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, and Deutsche Bank.

Investment banks underwrite new debt and equity securities for all types of corporations, aid in the sale of these securities, and help to facilitate mergers and acquisitions, reorganizations, and broker trades for institutions and private investors. At times, investment banks also provide guidance to issuers regarding the issue and placement of stock.

Retail Banking

UBS retail banking is what many traditionally view as mass-market banking, wherein individual customers use the local branches of larger commercial banks. Other examples of retail banks include Citibank and T.D. Bank.

UBS retail bank offers savings and checking accounts, mortgages, personal loans, debit or credit cards, and certificates of deposit (CDs). The focus is on the individual consumer.

What Does UBS Stand For? UBS is the acronym for Union Bank of Switzerland (""Union de Banques Suisses"" or ""Unione di Banche Svizzere"" in French or Italian, respectively. In German, it's ""Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft""). When Union Bank merged with Swiss Bank, the new entity took on the name UBS.

Is UBS a US Bank? While UBS is based in Switzerland, it also operates as a licensed U.S. bank, headquartered in New York City and registered in Utah, known as UBS Bank USA.

What Does UBS Wealth Management Do? UBS Wealth Management provides a range of financial planning services for individuals and businesses. These include portfolio management, market research, retirement planning, and educational planning.

The Bottom Line

UBS is a Swiss investment bank with global operations; it operates in more than 50 countries worldwide, with close to 60,000 employees. Its primary divisions include investment and retail banking, and asset and wealth management. This financial institution has a major presence in the United States, including at its American headquarters in New York City.

https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/stock-market-credit-suisse-bank-merger-03-20-23/index.html,Live updates: Credit Suisse-UBS deal and global stock market news,"Rep. Patrick McHenry, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said the contributions from a fundraiser that Signature Bank threw him prior to the bank’s collapse weren’t processed and have been returned.

“So when people contribute to me, it's an endorsement of my agenda -- not the other way around,” McHenry said, when pressed by CNN on whether he should recuse himself from any investigations into the bank failures. “In this circumstance, we had not processed the contributions and we returned them all.”

The fundraiser was first reported by Bloomberg.

McCarthy later defended his chairman, saying McHenry “doesn’t raise money because these people are influencing him” and pointed out that “there’s a limited amount that someone can provide in this process” anyway.

During a pen-and-pad with reporters at the House GOP policy retreat, McHenry and other top Republicans talked about the need to bring in bank executives to answer questions about the recent bank failures and dismissed the idea that loosening the Dodd-Frank law in 2018 had anything to do with their collapse.

Republicans demurred on whether a legislative response, such as insuring deposits beyond $250,000, is necessary, saying they need to get more information first.

“I want the investigation, the data, to lead to our conclusion for sound public policy,” McHenry said. “That's my role as committee chair.”","['Aditi Sangal', 'Nicole Goodkind', 'Lucy Bayly']",2023-03-20 09:33:41+00:00

https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ubs-names-sergio-ermotti-new-ceo-president-2023-03-29/,Sergio Ermotti returns as UBS CEO to steer Credit Suisse takeover,"Summary

Summary Companies Swiss banker Ermotti was UBS CEO 2011 to 2020

UBS agreed rescue takeover of rival this month

Analysts, some shareholders welcome Ermotti's return















ZURICH, March 29 (Reuters) - UBS Group AG (UBSG.S) has rehired Sergio Ermotti as CEO to steer its massive takeover of neighbour Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) - a surprise move to take advantage of the Swiss banker's experience rebuilding the bank after the global financial crisis.

The trader turned corporate problem fixer faces the tough challenge of laying off thousands of staff, cutting back Credit Suisse's investment bank and reassuring the world's wealthy that UBS remains a safe harbour for their cash.

""We felt we had a better horse,"" said UBS chairman Colm Kelleher of the decision to replace current CEO Ralph Hamers after less than three years in charge.

Kelleher said he brought back Ermotti because he was best equipped to see through the biggest deal in finance since the global banking crash more than a decade ago.

""This is not a Swiss solution,"" he said, seeking to play down any role of Ermotti's nationality in getting the job, and instead emphasised his focus was on the large risks of making the merger work for UBS.

""Being Swiss helps,"" Kelleher said. ""But the majority of our business is global.""

Ermotti, who was chief executive of UBS from 2011 to 2020 and is now chairman of Swiss Re (SRENH.S), will take the helm from April 5. The 62-year old is credited with executing UBS's turnaround after a series of scandals and losses nearly caused the bank's implosion.

He made a plea on Wednesday for ""a little bit of patience"" over a ""couple of months"" to allow the bank to forge its strategic plan. ""We cannot rush into decisions which are regrettable,"" he told journalists.

He said he had returned to UBS after feeling what he termed ""a call of duty"" and added he had always wanted to be involved in a massive transaction like the takeover of Credit Suisse.

He takes charge weeks after UBS bought its Swiss rival in a shotgun merger engineered by Swiss authorities to stem turmoil after Credit Suisse ran aground.

That deal makes UBS Switzerland's one and only global bank, underpinned by roughly 260 billion francs ($283 billion) in state loans and guarantees, a risky bet that makes the Swiss economy more dependent on a single lender.

In a reminder of how UBS will be inheriting some of Credit Suisse's troubles, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee found on Wednesday the bank had violated a 2014 tax evasion deal and said its new owners or the Swiss government should assume responsibility for any future fines.

Still, UBS shares rose 3.6% on Wednesday, beating the Swiss blue chip index's (.SSMI) 1.2% gain.

HAMERS HANDS OVER REINS

Analysts said Ermotti's experience paring back UBS's investment bank after the 2008 financial crash made him well equipped for the job.

""The decision to bring back Sergio Ermotti is very positive as it reduces integration and execution risk by 80%,"" said Davide Serra, CEO of Algebris Investments.

""Sergio has already reduced risk and made the investment bank serve its clients and not its investment bankers as Credit Suisse did. As a shareholder and bondholder I am very happy,"" he added.

Reuters Graphics

Ermotti had earlier described the task of integrating UBS and Credit Suisse as ""urgent and challenging"".

Outgoing CEO Hamers, who had succeeded Ermotti in November 2020, ""has agreed to step down to serve the interests of the new combination ... and the country,"" UBS said.

Hamers, who will stay on as an adviser, had no big-ticket M&A experience under his belt and faced the task of combining two banks with $1.6 trillion in assets, more than 120,000 staff and a complex balance sheet.

The Dutch executive was a notable absentee from the announcement of UBS's takeover of Credit Suisse on March 19. The next day, Hamers looked bleary eyed as he described the end of Credit Suisse as a ""sad day"" that nobody wanted.

A nearly 30-year veteran of Dutch lender ING, Hamers was a surprise choice when he was appointed to lead UBS, as he had little experience in investment banking or wealth management.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/18/business/credit-suisse-crisis-ubs/index.html,Credit Suisse faces fateful weekend. Will UBS step up with a rescue bid?,"London CNN —

The fate of Credit Suisse could be decided in the next 24 hours after a torrid week for Switzerland’s second biggest bank.

Local media reported that the Swiss cabinet had gathered for a crisis meeting at 5 p.m. local time (12 p.m. ET) Saturday to discuss the ailing bank’s future, as reports swirled of a possible takeover by its biggest Swiss rival, UBS (UBS). A spokesperson for the Swiss finance ministry declined to comment.

Investors and customers pulled their money out of Credit Suisse over the past several days as turmoil swept the global banking industry following the collapse of two US lenders.

Shares of the bank lost 25% over the course of the week, despite an emergency $54 billion loan from the Swiss National Bank. The price of financial contracts designed to protect investors against possible losses on its bonds soared to record levels. More than $450 million was pulled from European and US funds managed by the bank between Monday and Wednesday, according to Morningstar.

The lifeline from the Swiss central bank, announced late Wednesday night after the stock had crashed to a new record low, only bought Credit Suisse (CS) some time.

Reuters and the Financial Times, citing people familiar with the matter, both reported that Swiss regulators were urging UBS to agree a rescue of Credit Suisse before markets open Monday to shore up confidence in the country’s banking system. The FT said the boards of UBS and Credit Suisse were expected to meet separately over the weekend.

Credit Suisse and UBS both declined to comment to Reuters.

BlackRock (BLK), which owns 4% of Credit Suisse, denied a separate report in the Financial Times that it was drawing up an alternative bid for all or part of the beleagured bank.

“BlackRock is not participating in any plans to acquire all or any part of Credit Suisse, and has no interest in doing so,” a BlackRock spokesperson told CNN.

Credit Suisse, which is among the 30 most important banks in the global financial system, has been on the ropes for years following a series of scandals, huge losses and strategic missteps. Its stock is down 75% over the past 12 months. But the crisis of confidence escalated rapidly this month.

The failure of Silicon Valley Bank last week, the biggest by a US lender since the global financial crisis of 2008, sent investors fleeing other players perceived as weak.

Then Credit Suisse dropped another bombshell. Publishing its annual report on Tuesday, the 167-year-old bank acknowledged “material weakness” in its financial reporting, adding it had failed to adequately identify potential risks to its financial statements.

The following day, its biggest shareholder — the Saudi National Bank — made clear it would not be pumping any more money into the bank, after spending $1.5 billion last year for a stake of almost 10%. That spooked investors.

In a note on Thursday, JPMorgan banking analysts wrote that a takeover by UBS was the most probable endgame.

UBS would likely spin off Credit Suisse’s Swiss business since the combined market share would make up about 30% of Switzerland’s domestic banking market and mean “too much concentration risk and market share control,” they added.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/24/investing/european-bank-stocks-ubs-deutsche/index.html,"Deutsche Bank, UBS stocks sink as fear of European banking crisis returns","London CNN —

Europe’s banking stocks tumbled Friday as investors acted on their lingering worries that the recent crises at some banks could spill over into the wider sector.

Europe’s Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index, which tracks 42 big EU and UK banks, closed 3.8% lower. The index is down 18% from its high in late February. London’s bank-heavy FTSE 100 index closed down 1.3%.

Shares in Germany’s biggest bank, Deutsche Bank (DB), plunged as much as 14.5% before paring its losses to close 8.5% lower. Shares in UBS (UBS) and Credit Suisse (CS) were 3.6% and 5.2% down respectively.

The cost of insuring against a possible default by Deutsche Bank on its debt has soared in recent days. Deutsche’s five-year credit default swaps (CDS) skyrocketed to 203 basis points Thursday, according to data from S&P Market Intelligence. That’s their highest level since early 2019.

The swaps rose again Friday to trade at 208 basis points at midday ET.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Friday that there was “no reason to be concerned” about Deutsche Bank.

“It’s a very profitable bank,” he told reporters in Brussels, where EU leaders issued a joint statement describing the European banking system as “resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions.”

Deutsche Bank declined to comment.

“The rising price of insuring CDS senior debt is weighing on Deutsche Bank, as well as other European banks, on concerns over the impact of rising rates on the wider economy and banks’ balance sheets,” Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, told CNN.

Last week, the European Central Bank stuck with its plan to hike interest rates by half a percentage point, judging that inflation posed a bigger threat to the economy than recent turmoil in the banking sector.

Then, on Thursday, the Bank of England raised its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point after data showed a surprise spike in inflation last month.

But Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at investing platform Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNN that market nerves were out of step with reality.

“Worries about contagion are again rearing up even though more deposits appear to have been flowing into the German lender since the banking scare erupted, and it is thought to have capital reserves well in excess of regulatory requirements,” she said.

Some analysts said investors had been rattled by Deutsche Bank’s announcement Friday that it would pay back one of its bonds five years before its maturity date. Investors would usually interpret such a move as a sign that a company is in good financial health and able to pay back its creditors early.

But — after two bank collapses in the United States and an emergency takeover of Credit Suisse this month — some investors may have interpreted the announcement as a sign that Deutsche Bank is nervous about the state of the banking sector and trying to overcompensate, Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics, told CNN.

Goltermann said the bank’s decision “seems to have backfired.”

Deutsche Bank’s decision to pay back the bond ahead of schedule was pre-planned and not a reaction to recent market developments, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The bond would have gradually lost its eligibility as a form of regulatory capital according to rules brought in after the 2008 financial crisis, the source said.

The bank replaced the bond by issuing another bond of the same type in February, they added.

Shares of Germany’s Commerzbank (CRZBF) and France’s Société Générale also suffered heavy losses, closing 5.5% and 5.9% lower respectively.

Swiss banks still rattled

Last week, Switzerland’s biggest bank UBS bought its embattled Swiss rival for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion) in an emergency takeover brokered by the Swiss government.

That helped restore some calm to markets rattled by the failure earlier this month of two US regional banks. But investors were on edge again Friday.

The falls in UBS and Credit Suisse come after Bloomberg reported Thursday that the US Department of Justice was investigating whether their staff had helped Russian oligarchs evade Western sanctions.

The DOJ had sent subpoenas to those employees before UBS took over Credit Suisse, according to the report.

Employees at some major US banks are also part of the probe, Bloomberg said.

Hewson at CMC Markets said “the DOJ probe into UBS is certainly playing a part in the share price weakness” in European banks.

Swiss President Alain Berset said banking giant UBS is acquiring its smaller rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in global banking

GENEVA -- Banking giant UBS is buying troubled rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion, in a deal orchestrated by regulators in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in the global banking system.

Swiss authorities pushed for UBS to take over its smaller rival after a plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and the bank’s customers. Shares of Credit Suisse and other banks plunged this week after the failure of two banks in the U.S. sparked concerns about other potentially shaky institutions in the global financial system.

Credit Suisse is among the 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

The deal was “one of great breadth for the stability of international finance,"" said Swiss President Alain Berset as he announced it Sunday night. ""An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.”

Switzerland's executive branch, a seven-member governing body that includes Berset, passed an emergency ordinance allowing the merger to go through without shareholder approval.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann called the sale “a clear turning point.”

“It is a historic, sad and very challenging day for Credit Suisse, for Switzerland and for the global financial markets,” Lehmann said, adding that the focus is now on the future and in particular on the 50,000 Credit Suisse employees, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland.

Following news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated financial moves to stabilize banks in the coming week. This includes daily access to a lending facility for banks looking to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice which widely used during the 2008 financial crisis. Three months after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September of 2008, such swap lines had been tapped for $580 billion. Added swap lines were also rolled out during market turmoil in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in March of 2020.

“Today is one of the most significant days in European banking since 2008, with far-reaching repercussions for the industry,"" said Max Georgiou, an analyst at Third Bridge. “These events could alter the course of not only European banking but also the wealth management industry more generally.”

Colm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed the “enormous opportunities” that emerge from the takeover, and highlighted his bank’s “conservative risk culture” — a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse's reputation for more swashbuckling, aggressive gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said the council ""regrets that the bank, which was once a model institution in Switzerland and part of our strong location, was able to get into this situation at all.”

The combination of the two biggest and best-known Swiss banks, each with storied histories dating to the mid-19th century, amounts to a thunderclap for Switzerland’s reputation as a global financial center — leaving it on the cusp of having a single national champion in banking.

The deal follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further panic. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse’s share price began plummeting this week.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde lauded the “swift action” by Swiss officials, saying they were “instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.”

She said the banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.

UBS officials said they plan to sell off parts of Credit Suisse or reduce the bank's size in the coming months and years.

The Swiss government is providing more than 100 billion francs in aid and financial backstops to make the deal go through.

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out. European bank regulators use a special type of bond designed to provide a capital cushion to banks in times of distress. But these bonds are designed to be wiped out if a bank’s capital falls below a certain level, which was triggered as part of this government-brokered deal.

Berset said the Federal Council had already been discussing a long-troubled situation at Credit Suisse since the beginning of the year and held urgent meetings in the last four days amid spiraling concerns about its financial health that caused major swoons in its stock price and raised the specter of the 2007-08 financial crisis.

Investors and banking industry analysts were still digesting the deal, but at least one analyst was sour on the news because it could damage Switzerland’s global banking image.

“A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,” said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas LLC, in an email.

Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

The Credit Suisse parent bank is not part of European Union supervision, but it has entities in several European countries that are. Lagarde reiterated what she said last week after the central bank raised interest rates — that the European banking sector is resilient, with strong financial reserves and plenty of ready cash.

Many of Credit Suisse’s problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.

The deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn't invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.

On Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.

Its current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.

While smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.

The Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

https://wtop.com/world/2023/03/ubs-brings-back-ermotti-as-ceo-with-credit-suisse-deal-ahead/,UBS brings back Ermotti as CEO with Credit Suisse deal ahead,"GENEVA (AP) — UBS said Wednesday that it’s bringing back former CEO Sergio Ermotti to lead the Swiss bank as…

GENEVA (AP) — UBS said Wednesday that it’s bringing back former CEO Sergio Ermotti to lead the Swiss bank as it executes a government-orchestrated plan to take over struggling rival Credit Suisse.

Ermotti, who was the bank’s top executive for nine years and led a turnaround following the 2008 global financial crisis, will take over next Wednesday from CEO Ralph Hamers.

Hamers took up the job in November 2020 and will remain at UBS during a transition period “to ensure a successful closure of the transaction and a smooth handover,” the bank said in a statement.

“Whilst Ralph was capable of doing the job, we felt that Sergio was better suited to navigating these things,” Chairman Colm Kelleher said on a conference call, alluding to the UBS board decision. “I cannot reemphasize how big this deal is in terms of financial history and financial engineering that’s required.”

UBS credited Ermotti, who is now chairman of insurer Swiss Re, for having “cut its footprint” and changing the culture of the bank — and it pointed to his experience in bringing big financial institutions together.

Ermotti, who hails from the southern, mostly Italian-speaking Swiss region of Ticino, acknowledged that “coming back to manage this situation is a challenge” but felt “a sense of call-of-duty aspect” to return.

Plus, he said he had contemplated a tie-up like the one with Credit Suisse while previously in the top job, and it would be a bit of a ”contradiction” for him not to accept the post “to basically execute on what I believe was the right next move for UBS.”

Kelleher said he called Ermotti “to explore the possibility of this” a day after the emergency takeover deal was settled on March 19, which involved Swiss regulators, the federal government and top executives at both banks.

“This is is the biggest single financial transaction since 2008. That brings significant execution risk,” Kelleher said.

The hastily arranged, $3.25 billion deal for Credit Suisse aimed to stem the upheaval in the global financial system after the collapse of two U.S. banks and jitters about long-running troubles at Credit Suisse led shares of Switzerland’s second-largest bank to tank and customers to pull out their money.

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after the central bank’s plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and customers. The Swiss executive branch passed emergency measures to bypass shareholder approval.

Uncertainties still lie ahead, including a U.S. Senate committee report released Wednesday that says Credit Suisse violated a plea agreement with U.S. authorities by failing to report secret offshore accounts that wealthy Americans used to avoid paying taxes.

UBS said it assessed outstanding lawsuits and investigations as part of the Credit Suisse acquisition and expects the deal to be beneficial for shareholders. It says it’s working to close the sale and get approval from regulators in the coming weeks or months.

Hamers, the outgoing CEO, said UBS executives want to ensure “a digestible transaction” in terms of risk. He said there were plans to “manage down the investment bank” at Credit Suisse because many of the activities were not central for UBS.

UBS leaders announced no immediate plan about job cuts linked to the deal.

Swiss lawmakers and academics have raised concerns that the deal could create an unwieldy Swiss banking behemoth, while UBS executives said regulatory issues loom internationally before the deal can close.

Ermotti suggested he didn’t view “too big too fail” concerns as a problem.

“I do think that scale and size is not a problem if it is focused and well-managed,” he said. “For me, the debate nowadays is not ‘too big to fail’ but ‘too small to survive’ — and we want to be a winner.”

Many Credit Suisse customers have expressed regret at the looming disappearance of a 167-year-old bank that has been a pillar of Switzerland’s renowned banking and financial industry.

Shares of UBS and Credit Suisse closed up 3.7% and 4%, respectively, on the Swiss stock exchange — though European bank stocks overall ended higher.

https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/20/what-ubs-rescue-of-credit-suisse-cs-means-for-markets-and-banks.html,'Shotgun wedding': What the UBS rescue of Credit Suisse means for global markets,"Axel Lehmann, chairman of Credit Suisse Group AG, left, and Colm Kelleher, chairman of UBS Group AG, during a news conference in Bern, Switzerland, on Sunday, March 19, 2023.

""We are happy to have found a solution, which I'm convinced will bring lasting stability and security for clients, staff, financial markets and to Switzerland.""

""The accelerating loss of confidence and the escalation over the last few days have made it clear that Credit Suisse can no longer exist in its current form,"" Lehmann said.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann told a press conference Sunday that the ""latest developments that emanated from the banks in the U.S. hit us at the most unfavorable moment.""

The announcement of a loan of up to 50 billion Swiss francs from the Swiss National Bank failed to soothe investor concerns and eventually necessitated the 167-year-old institution's ""emergency rescue"" by UBS.

After years of heavy losses and costly scandals , Credit Suisse's most recent share price plunge began with the collapse of U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and was compounded when top investor the Saudi National Bank said it could not provide any more financial assistance.

Despite bold proclamations from Swiss authorities and central banks about a return to stability, the deal does not appear to have laid to rest concerns about systemic risks to global markets.

In equal parts ""shotgun wedding"" and arranged marriage, UBS agreed to buy stricken domestic rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion) on Sunday.

The cut-price deal is expected to close this year and creates a banking behemoth with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets. The deal also includes support from the Swiss government, financial regulator FINMA, and the Swiss National Bank (SNB), which will offer a liquidity line of up to 100 billion Swiss francs, backed by a federal default guarantee. The government will offer a loss guarantee of up to 9 billion Swiss francs, with UBS assuming the first 5 billion of potential losses.

Shares of both UBS and Credit Suisse plunged on Monday morning, however.

Clarity at last?

Goldman Sachs said in a note late Sunday that the deal and associated liquidity and loss guarantees provided ""clarity"" and dampened tail risks. The U.S. bank has shifted back to an overweight allocation on European banks as a result.

""Of course, we are mindful that the situation among U.S. regional banks remains fluid. But as we discussed on Friday, we take comfort from the limited contagion from U.S. regional banks to larger money center banks, a trend we expect will persist,"" the Wall Street giant's credit strategists said.

Goldman also reiterated its favorable view on U.S. ""money center"" banks, a view echoed by Smead Capital Management's CEO Cole Smead, who said interest rate rises from central banks help lenders ""that don't do stupid things in their assets.""

""Poor stock markets have caused investment banks to be the laggards, but commercial banks look good next to them,"" he said via email, naming JPMorgan and Bank of America as stocks he particularly likes.

Smead also said investors could expect higher returns on assets from the new UBS-Credit Suisse entity, along with more consolidation in the European banking sector.

But bigger questions remain over the potential market impact of the deal. James Sym, head of equities at London-based investment manager River and Mercantile, told CNBC that the market was in ""seek and destroy mode.""

""This solves what I think is probably an idiosyncratic problem at Credit Suisse, but I'm not sure it's a firebreak big enough to stop the rot for the market,"" he said Monday. Although he added that the rest of the European banking system is ""much more robust"" than it was.""

Since the Global Financial Crisis, the continent's banks have built much larger capital buffers in order to withstand systemic risks.

Sym suggested that if European bank shares fall significantly as a result of the deal, he might ""start to nibble"" at some stocks, potentially even UBS.

""In the short term, the market is not going to like this deal for UBS, it's not core to the strategy, but I think over the medium term it does potentially give them an edge to compete globally with the Americans and really puts them in an unassailable position domestically.""

Risks remain

While the deal could bring an end to doubts about the viability of Credit Suisse as a business, some analysts still believe the devil will be in the detail as the finer points are hashed out over the coming weeks and months.

""One issue is that the reported price of $3.25bn (CHF0.5 per share) equates to ~4% of book value, and about 10% of Credit Suisse's market value at the start of the year,"" said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics.

""This suggests that a substantial part of Credit Suisse's $570bn assets may be either impaired or perceived as being at risk of becoming impaired. This could set in train renewed jitters about the health of banks.""

Shearing added that there may yet be risks to the deal ""for legal or financial reasons, or if confidence in UBS is dented and it gets cold feet about the deal.""

""Only time will tell how this shotgun wedding is received,"" he added.

The AT1 bond issue

As part of the deal, Swiss regulator FINMA announced the wipeout of 16 billion Swiss francs' worth of Credit Suisse's Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds, which some investors fear signals further spillover risk for global credit.

This was a major focal point for analysts assessing the potential ramifications on Monday morning.

""AT1 bonds were introduced in Europe after the global financial crisis to serve as shock absorbers when banks start to fail,"" explained Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer at Syz Bank.

""They are designed to impose permanent losses on bondholders or be converted into equity if a bank's capital ratios fall below a predetermined level, effectively propping up its balance sheet and allowing it to stay in business. According to the Swiss bail-in regime, AT1 debt is above equity in the loss absorption waterfall.""",['Elliot Smith'],2023-03-20 00:00:00

I recently overheard a new employee at my gym on the Upper East Side getting trained on the various aspects of keeping the locker room in order. Among the key things to remember was reopening the steam room at exactly 3:30 p.m. after its cleaning.

""It can't be 3:31 or 3:32. ... These people are on tight schedules,"" the person reiterated to their trainee multiple times.

That brings us to Hayley Cuccinello's recent story about the concerns UBS' ultra-rich clients have about what the firm's rescue takeover of Credit Suisse will mean for the white-glove service they're accustomed to.

Steam rooms are a far cry from catering to the wealthiest people in the world, but the point stands: People who pay a lot for something expect a certain level of service.

(For the record, I would die before I complained about a steam room opening a minute late.)

As UBS tries to figure out how to integrate Credit Suisse into its sprawling wealth management business ($2.8 trillion in assets at the end of 2022), some current clientele worry they might get lost in the shuffle.

Add in the fact that this is a deal both sides aren't very happy about in the first place and you start to see why people are concerned. Hayley has all the details from rich clients as well as industry analysts about why this whole thing could spell disaster.

If you're not looking to throw a pity party for some of the world's wealthiest people (I get it), perhaps consider the bigger picture. It's still early days, but the UBS-Credit Suisse deal might be the best example of something that makes sense on paper, but doesn't work in reality.

What seemed like a massive win for UBS — scooping up its biggest domestic rival — could in fact prove to be a massive problem for them for years to come.

https://www.ibtimes.com/ubs-takeover-credit-suisse-main-points-3678418,UBS Takeover Of Credit Suisse: The Main Points,"The takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS will create a banking giant unprecedented in the history of Switzerland, where banking is a core part of the national identity.

Here are the main points of the deal worth three billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion), which concluded Sunday after intense negotiations involving the government, the financial regulators and the central bank.

Credit Suisse, the country's second-largest bank, has been in turmoil for two years and was one of 30 global financial institutions considered too big to fail.

""Its fate is therefore not only decisive for Switzerland, for our companies, for private clients, for its own employees, but also for the stability of the entire financial system,"" Swiss President Alain Berset said in unveiling the deal.

Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said the bankruptcy of Credit Suisse could have caused ""irreparable economic turmoil"".

""For this reason, Switzerland has to take responsibility beyond its own borders,"" she said.

""The UBS takeover of Credit Suisse has laid the foundation for greater stability both in Switzerland and internationally.""

""The combination of the two banks further strengthens UBS's position as a leading global wealth manager with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets operating in the most attractive growth markets,"" said UBS chairman Colm Kelleher.

""It will also reinforce UBS's position as the leading universal bank in Switzerland and further extend our position as the most important Swiss global bank.""

UBS said in a statement: ""The combination of the two businesses is expected to generate annual run-rate of cost reductions of more than $8 billion by 2027.""

The deal will be an all-share transaction, with Credit Suisse shareholders receiving one UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares held -- equivalent to 0.76 Swiss francs per share -- well below Friday's closing price of 1.86 Swiss francs.

However, this takeover will not be subject to a shareholder vote, in accordance with an agreement reached with the Swiss authorities and other regulatory authorities.

The Competition Commission will also have no say in the exceptional merger between the country's two biggest banks.

""The merger is expected to be consummated by end of 2023 if possible,"" Credit Suisse said in a statement.

In the meantime, Credit Suisse will continue to implement its restructuring programme ""in collaboration with UBS"".

FINMA, the Swiss financial regulator, said all the bank's services would continue without interruption.

""This will ensure protection for depositors as accounts, security accounts and other services (counters, ATMs, e-banking, debit and credit cards) will likewise remain accessible as usual,"" it said.

UBS will take over the wealth management, asset management and Swiss domestic banking at Credit Suisse, which encompasses its retail banking and loans to small and medium enterprises.

""UBS intends to downsize Credit Suisse's investment banking business and align it with our conservative risk culture,"" Kelleher said, referring to one of the riskier aspects of the Credit Suisse portfolio.

However, neither Kelleher or Credit Suisse chairman Axel Lehmann gave details on potential job cuts, though the intention is the period of uncertainty to be as short as possible.

To facilitate the deal, the Swiss government granted UBS a guarantee of nine billion Swiss francs to assume potential losses arising from certain assets that UBS takes over.

The Swiss National Bank central bank will also allocate significant aid to the two banks in the form of liquidity of up to 100 billion Swiss francs.",['Nathalie Olof-Ors'],2023-03-19 22:57:29-04:00

https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/ubs-can-score-quick-win-with-swiss-sale-2023-04-12/,UBS can score a quick win with Swiss sale,"













LONDON, April 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Credit Suisse’s (CSGN.S) Swiss business is theoretically the jewel in the bank’s tarnished crown. But for UBS (UBSG.S) Chair Colm Kelleher, getting rid of his rival’s local unit may nonetheless be the least-bad option.

A key appeal of UBS’s state-backed emergency rescue of its struggling peer is the chance to axe expenses. Meshing Credit Suisse’s local bank – which serves retail, corporate and wealthy clients in Switzerland – with UBS’s equivalent division could generate $1.5 billion of annual savings, according to RBC analysts. Those could have a net present value of $9.5 billion, after factoring in tax and restructuring costs, according to a Breakingviews calculation.

Yet the savings could easily disappoint. Swiss clients of both UBS and Credit Suisse may decide to spread their risk by moving some business elsewhere, rather than sticking entirely with the newly created behemoth. RBC analysts reckon these so-called dis-synergies could lead to a $1.4 billion loss of revenue in Switzerland, or roughly one-third of the Credit Suisse unit’s 2022 top line.

UBS also risks inflaming opposition to the deal, which will create a giant with 29% of total Swiss deposits and may lead to job losses and branch closures in the country. Politicians, who debated the takeover in an emergency session on Tuesday, can’t block it. But after the 2008 crisis, many governments punished banks by imposing taxes and pay restrictions. Swiss solvency rules already include add-ons linked to market share, meaning UBS may in future have to fund the combined domestic business with more capital than if the two divisions were separate.

Hiving off the Credit Suisse local unit could save Kelleher and his Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti a lot of grief. It may also generate a handsome payday, which could help speed up the rest of the merger integration. The legal entity that houses much of Credit Suisse’s domestic business last year made about a 9% return on $14 billion of shareholder’s equity, according to Breakingviews calculations. That justifies a valuation of perhaps $11 billion, assuming a conservative 12% cost of equity. By contrast, UBS is paying just $3.6 billion for all of Credit Suisse, based on the buyer’s most recent share price.

The tricky part would be how to structure a deal. Kelleher could in theory just hand the Credit Suisse local division to shareholders, but that could prove destabilising if they all cash out immediately. Another option is to raise funds by listing a chunk of the shares, and sell the rest over time. It helps that most of Credit Suisse’s domestic business is already in a carved-out unit with its own capital and funding requirements.

True, a sale or listing would add one more complication to an already tricky deal. But it has to be simpler than a lengthy and politically fraught integration.

CONTEXT NEWS

Switzerland’s parliament on April 11 failed to approve the 109 billion Swiss francs ($120.5 billion) of financial guarantees used to rescue Credit Suisse in a deal with UBS last month, in a first-round vote that was largely symbolic.

The lower house retrospectively rejected the rescue at close to midnight, with heated debates continuing into the early hours of April 12. Earlier on April 11, Switzerland’s upper house had approved the rescue, meaning the two chambers of the legislative body will vote again.

The votes are, however, largely symbolic because the state committed the funds and lawmakers cannot overturn that decision.

UBS will rescue Credit Suisse in a deal worth about 3 billion Swiss francs, Swiss authorities and the two banks said on March 19.

The analyst noted that even as revenue in the investment banking sector declined last year, the strength of Goldman Sachs' trading business helped offset that slowdown. Total trading was up 16% in 2022, which Hawken notes was the best among U.S. big banks, while investment banking revenue dropped 48%. UBS also said Goldman's push into expanding its financing business has helped lower its revenue volatility. Meanwhile, UBS view's management's decision to potentially sell or wind down its enterprise partnerships and point-of-sale lending business lines as a promising effort in de-risking the company from loss-producing headwinds. Hawken added that, ""As a [Global Systemically Important Bank], the firm is already subject to the highest capital requirements, so while Basel 4 certainly could increase capital requirements, the changes should be less significant than for regional banks."" Basel IV refers to a set of proposed banking reforms created after the 2008 financial crisis that were implemented starting Jan. 1. Shares were up 0.5% Wednesday during premarket trading.

https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/our-approach/marketnews/article.1589059.html,China’s March imports underscore positive commodity outlook,"China’s imports in March fell 1.4% y/y, beating market expectations and reflecting a marked improvement from a fall of 10.2% in the January to February period. Exports last month also posted a surprise surge, according to customs data, as the world’s second largest economy continues its recovery following three years of zero-COVID policies.

More specifically, China’s crude oil imports jumped 22.5% from March last year to 12.4mbpd, marking the highest monthly level since June 2020, and its soybean purchases were up 7.9% y/y to 6.9 million tonnes.

Accelerating growth in China is one of the reasons we continue to favor exposure to broad commodities, but we also see other supporting factors that will underpin the sector’s total return outlook of around 20% over the next 12 months.

A tightening oil market. Brent crude prices have risen nearly 20% since their March low as the market refocuses on fundamental tightness. Recent data shows renewed large on-land inventory drops of more than 30 million barrels over the past several weeks across the US, Europe, Singapore, Japan and Fujairah, suggesting that the market remained undersupplied. Iraq’s exports from the north have yet to resume, with 500,000bpd of oil output lost since 25 March. In addition, we think the voluntary production cuts by nine OPEC+ members should tighten the oil market further from May onwards.

Lingering climate and geopolitical risks for agricultural commodities. While Russia agreed to extend the Black Sea grain deal last month, the renewal covers only half of the intended period. The war also has a longer-lasting impact on output from Ukraine as farmers’ ability to prepare fields and plant seeds has been disrupted. Separately, the probability of an El Niño event by year-end has risen to 60%. Historically, this event has negatively affected yields for corn, rice, and wheat.

Improving outlook for industrial metals. China’s demand recovery for industrial metals has been slower than expected, with copper imports in March 19% lower than a year ago. But we expect the situation to improve as Chinese consumption enters a peak season amid Beijing’s pro-growth policy focus. We’ve recently raised our forecast for property sales this year following a strong March number, and we expect the country’s electrical network sector to grow 3.3%. Separately, supply challenges in South America should leave the copper market with a marginal deficit in 2023. Overall, industrial metal inventories are at structurally low levels and remain supportive for prices.

So, we maintain our most preferred rating on commodities in our global strategy, and recommend investors to take direct exposure. Downward-sloping curves offer roll gains, while higher yields have improved returns on cash collateral. Given the unique characteristics and drivers of individual commodities, actively managed strategies should enable investors to potentially boost their returns relative to risk.",[],

Synder said while the market’s valuation of GE’s GE, +0.21% stock may be “pushing near the upper limit,” his chief concern is geopolitical, not macroeconomic.

“[GE’s] exposure is defensive and well positioned for the macro at hand with each business line seeing low-risk [positive] rate of change, into both 2023 [and] 2024,” Snyder wrote in a note to clients.

He reiterated the buy rating he’s had on GE’s stock for at least three years while lifting his price target to $109 from $95. The stock hasn’t closed at or above $109 since January 2018.

The stock rose 0.1% in afternoon trading, with Snyder’s new price target implying about 16% upside from current levels. It has slipped nearly 3% since closing at a five-year high of $96.92 on April 3.

Synder said his new price target includes a $94-per-share valuation for GE’s aviation business and a $16-per-share valuation for GE Vernova, which includes the company’s power and renewable-energy businesses.

GE Vernova is expected to separate from GE in early 2024, which would leave GE operating as GE Aerospace. GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. GEHC, +1.46% separated from GE in January 2023.

GE is scheduled to report first-quarter results on April 25 before the opening bell. Since the end of January, after the separation of GE HealthCare, the average analyst estimate compiled by FactSet for earnings per share has increased to 14 cents from 13 cents, while the FactSet revenue consensus has slipped to $13.25 billion from $13.35 billion.

(AP ... [+] Photo/Paul Sakuma) Copyright 2009 AP. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Analysts at investment bank UBS are forecasting that some 50,000 U.S. stores are likely to close by the end of 2027, because of expected cutbacks in consumer spending, tighter credit and the continued shift to ecommerce.

Store closings could accelerate to 70,000 to 90,000 if retail sales turn out to be weaker than expected, according to UBS.

The United States gained stores in 2021, adding a net total of about 11,000 new stores. Last year, the country returned to the previous pattern of shrinking store counts, with 1,500 store closing as of the third quarter of 2022, according to UBS.

The pace of store closings has already accelerated this year, UBS said, with small chains and mom-and-pop stores being most at risk in the current economy. As of 2020, more than half of retail stores were operated by companies with fewer than 20 employees, and 68% of stores were operated by chains with less than 500 employees

The store-closing forecast is based on the assumption by UBS analysts that ecommerce penetration will increase from 20% currently to 26% by 2027. UBS calculates that every 100 basis point increase in online percentage of sales triggers about 8,000 store closings.

Banks are showing they are less willing to make consumer installment loans, which will hurt consumers’ ability to spend. UBS also expects there to will less capital available to allow entrepreneurs to open new retail stores.

Higher costs, particularly labor costs, also will drive store closings, UBS said. “Notably, despite all the automation in retail over the past several years, employees per store has increased for several retail sub-sectors,” according to UBS.

Home improvements stores had an average of 21 employees per store in 2021, compared to 16 in 2012. Electronics, home furnishings, auto parts, grocery, and sporting goods stores also have reported increases in average numbers of employees per store.

The retail sectors expected to have the most store closings, according to UBS, are clothing and clothing accessories (approximately 14,000); consumer electronics (some 9,000 closings); and home furnishings (4,000 closings).

Smaller number of closings are forecast for the home improvement and general merchandise sectors, and the number of auto parts stores is expected remain steady.

In-store fulfillment of online grocery orders is expected to help keep physical grocery stores open.

Since 2018. clothing stores have had the most store closings (down 10,500), followed by consumer electronics stores (-3,000) and sporting goods (-1,300).

Over the next five years, shopping center growth is expected to be limited, and thus will not contribute to store growth.

While the number of shopping centers continued to grow modestly in 2022, UBS believes the number of U.S. shopping centers, and the amount of shopping center square footage, have peaked, meaning mall-based stores face the greatest risk of closings.

The shift in malls toward more food and non-retail tenants will also contribute to store closings, UBS said.

“Even for malls that remain open, we believe there will be a shift away from retail to non-retail establishments, leading to retail closures,” the report said.","['Joan Verdon', 'Senior Contributor']",2023-04-12 00:00:00
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/retail-store-closings-prediction-ubs-analyst/,"Wall Street says 50,000 retail stores will close in 5 years","The past year has seen 2,000 retail store closures, with the likes of Bed Bath & Beyond, Foot Locker and Walmart shuttering locations as they look to save money. But that trickle is set to turn into a flood in the next five years, according to one Wall Street analysis that predicts 50,000 stores will close.

If the economy falls into a prolonged recession, closures could reach 90,000, analysts at UBS said in a research note published Tuesday. Smaller operations that employ 500 or fewer people are most likely to close, they wrote.

The U.S. currently has roughly 940,000 stores and the UBS prediction ""simply implies that there will be 5% fewer stores by the end of 2027,"" analysts said.

The forecast is particularly troubling because, according to the National Retail Federation, about 70% of retail sales still come from brick-and-mortar stores, meaning retailers could suffer greater losses once they close off the places where customers physically stroll and shop.

UBS pointed to three factors causing retail locations to close: the ever-growing prominence of online shopping; increased borrowing costs and customers tightening their wallets due to inflation.

Stubbornly high inflation in recent months has pinched household budgets, causing consumers to pay elevated prices for everyday staples like gas, groceries, clothes and housing.

Clothing, electronics and home furnishing stores will likely bear the brunt of closings in the coming years because more of their shoppers will opt to purchase those items online, UBS said. They project closures of 13,840 clothing stores, 9,190 electronics locations and 4,090 furniture stores.

By comparison, UBS expects home improvement stores to lose only 210 locations and auto parts stores to stay steady. Both job growth and year-over-year sales have increased at home improvement and auto parts stores, UBS said — two reasons why that sector of retail likely won't suffer as many closings in the future.

Major retailers — including Costco, Home Depot, Lowe's and Target — stand to benefit the most from the predicted store closings, UBS said. The closings of smaller operators would mean roughly $210 billion in retail sales would be up for grabs, analysts said.

""This translates to $1,600 annual spend per household that has the potential to shift to the leading retailers,"" UBS analysts said.

Some major retailers are already well into the closing spree. Companies shuttered about 1,500 stores last fall, UBS noted.

Bed Bath & Beyond said it plans to close nearly 240 stores this year as part of a larger effort to avoid bankruptcy. Walmart is closing more than a dozen low-performing locations in major cities like Atlanta, Chicago, Portland and Washington, D.C. Foot Locker said last month it plans to close 400 mall-based stores by 2026 and open more than 300 free-standing locations.","['Khristopher J. Brooks', 'Khristopher J.

https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/our-approach/marketnews/article.1589114.html,Biotech: The Human Genome Project turns 20,"Twenty years ago today, pioneering scientists announced the first-ever successful mapping of a complete human genome, helping usher in a new era of genetic research and collaborative science. This was a Herculean task in its day, costing an estimated USD 2.7bn and taking years of manual effort. Two decades later, your genome can be mapped out in an afternoon for as little as USD 200.

In the last year, rising interest rates have hurt biotech valuations, like other growth stocks, and the recent banking turmoil has dented confidence in the venture capital industry, which provides capital to the sector’s startups. We currently view the healthcare sector as least preferred on a tactical investment horizon, in part due to relative valuations. But the long-term investment case for biotech remains intact and is worth considering:

COVID-19 is just one of many viral diseases that need to be addressed. The efficacy and speed of mRNA vaccine development came into full view during the pandemic, greatly improving health outcomes. But viral diseases go well beyond the coronavirus; other infections are in wide circulation today, posing significant mortality and morbidity risks. For example, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections have quietly surged after the pandemic, causing more than 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths a year in the US alone. Biotech could offer important treatments to address these risks, with positive impact to human life and health systems.

Biotech can offer investors binary outcomes. In most cases, biotech companies that do not pass clinical trials and testing will fail and go out of business quickly. Those that succeed can establish demand more quickly than startups in other sectors, since the market fit typically is more obvious. For this reason, diversification across multiple companies in the industry is important. Biotech end-markets also tend to be less cyclical, as individual health needs are not directly linked to economic or market swings, although the funding cycle for unprofitable companies is important in driving sentiment toward and the performance of listed assets.

Private investors continue to fund promising research. Early-stage drug discovery is heavily reliant on venture capital given relatively scarce corporate funding. Despite rising headwinds, biotech fundraising has held up relatively well over the last year. According to Pitchbook, biotech and pharma raised around USD 31bn in venture capital in the US last year, down 21% from 2021, but a less steep decline than 38% for fintech and 54% for consumer tech. At the same time, assets in impact investing strategies surpassed USD 1tr in 2022, a large portion of which was in venture capital and social themes.

So, while there are near-term risks to consider, we see opportunities in early-stage virology treatments and genetic therapies, especially given recent pressure on valuations. Many of these opportunities can best be accessed via private markets, though we recommend selectivity within venture capital and growth equity and consideration of fund managers’ approaches to active venture building. Pressure on valuations remains a short-term risk, in our view, but also an attractive long-term opportunity to enter the market. In addition, many of these ventures seek to address diseases with no current treatments, offering investors a chance to align their portfolio with purpose and impact. Investors need to consider that private markets come with certain drawbacks, including the risk of an illiquid market, and those interested need to be willing and able to lock up capital for longer.",[],

https://www.ubs.com/us/en/wealth-management/insights/market-news/article.1589084.html,"S&P 500 EPS: Down but not out, for now","The turmoil in the banks has raised concerns that access to credit will become more challenging and lead to a slowdown in economic growth. While we agree that access to bank credit will likely become more difficult for certain segments of the economy, we think these headwinds will take time to show up in corporate fundamentals. In fact, we think 1Q23 numbers could be surprisingly resilient.

Early reporters—better than recent quarters

Results from the early reporters—roughly 20 S&P 500 constituents whose fiscal quarter ended in February— increase our conviction. The median company in this group has beaten earnings estimates by 6%, which is better than the roughly 3% beat witnessed in recent quarters. Management guidance about the outlook has also been healthy. The median 2Q EPS estimate for these companies is unchanged, versus a 2% decline for the next quarter in the most recent reporting seasons. In general, management teams highlighted that, so far, there has been no change in the outlook due to the banking stress.

Still, we don’t want to sound too exuberant about the upcoming 1Q results. Even if S&P 500 constituents beat earnings by 3-5%, that would still translate into a decline of 1–3% relative to the year ago period. And obviously results will vary by company and sector, with likely messy numbers from many of the smaller banks that are most exposed to the deposit flight and higher deposit costs.

Still, there are challenges ahead

Even though 1Q results may be good, we believe corporate profits still face challenges ahead. First, the yield curve—the spread between 10yr and 2yr US treasury yields—has been inverted on a sustainable basis since last summer. After all prior inversions in the last 50 years, the US economy has always slipped into recession, with the downturn starting about 15 months after the inversion. If history is a guide, economic conditions could be more challenging late this year.

Second, lending standards have been tightening for some time. The January 2023 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS) showed that a net 45% of banks tightened lending standards for large- and medium-sized firms.

Finally, although inflation is cooling, it remains too high. The Fed has more work to do in order to get inflation back down to its 2% target. And with the labor market still reasonably strong, we are skeptical the Fed will be able to cut interest rates this year. We think the Fed will likely need to keep monetary policy restrictive, forestalling any re-acceleration in economic growth that could re-ignite inflation.

Full year consensus estimates still look too high

Taken together, these conditions suggest investors should expect continued economic headwinds that will cap equity market upside and present downside risks in the months ahead. But the headwinds may not exert more sustained downward pressure on corporate profits and equity markets until later this year, and quite possibly late in the year. Consensus expectations for a re-acceleration in S&P 500 earnings growth and margins appears unlikely, in our view. We expect S&P 500 EPS to contract 5% in 2023 (USD 210) before growing by 10% (USD 230) in 2024. Our estimates are about 5% lower than bottom-up expectations.

Equities to remain range-bound

It's always difficult to determine how investors will perceive quarterly results. As we discussed, the results and guidance look poised to be better than what some investors may expect. And in some respects (the scope of the earnings beats and the near-term guidance), this earnings season could be better than the last few.

But we are also cognizant of the fact that the S&P 500 forward P/E of 18x is near its highest levels in about a year and higher than pre-pandemic levels. Further, it’s pretty unusual for the S&P 500 to trade above 18x. Historically this has only happened when consensus earnings growth expectations were robust (14% on average, compared to 4% today) and/or the 10-year Treasury yield was less than 2%. So despite sentiment that seems somewhat cautious, valuations appear to be much more optimistic. For this reason we think any earnings season-related upside will be somewhat limited.

We continue to think that the S&P 500 will remain in the wide range that has been in place over the last several months from the high 3,000s to the low 4,000s. Ultimately, what breaks the market out of this range will likely be investor conviction in a soft landing—which could drive the S&P 500 to around 4,400—or a hard landing—which could see the market fall to 3,300. Given the ongoing headwinds that we outlined above, we don’t think the risk-reward in the market is very compelling. Our year-end price target for the S&P 500 is 3,800.

Positioning

Given the headwinds we've highlighted, a defensive bias across sectors remains appropriate. While market breadth has been narrow this year and mega-cap “tech” has performed like a defensive, we think that investors can get much cheaper defensive exposure in consumer staples or utilities, whose valuations look low for a late cycle environment. We have most preferred views on the consumer staples, industrials, and utilities sectors and least preferred views on the consumer discretionary, financials, and information technology sectors.

Although we recently downgraded value stocks to neutral, we still prefer them to growth stocks which are rated least preferred. In the near-term, cyclical segments within value face elevated earnings risks and higher-quality growth stocks could continue to be perceived as “safe havens” during this period of economic uncertainty. But on a relative basis, growth stocks are trading at nearly twice their historical average valuation premium to value stocks and carry under-appreciated earnings risks. The double risk of elevated valuations and under-appreciated earnings risks in a potentially more challenging economic environment suggests growth stocks may be more vulnerable, in our view.

https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/our-approach/marketnews/article.1589091.html,FOMC minutes reflect banking system uncertainty,"The Fed provided a lot of information about its thinking on the day of the meeting through the FOMC statement, Chair Powell's press conference, and the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). As is usually the case, we did not find anything too surprising in the minutes, but they still provide useful details on the conversations that took place at the meeting.

One thing that is clear from the minutes is that at one point, the FOMC was prepared to raise the ""dots,"" which indicate expectations for the future path of Fed policy rates, by a considerable amount. This was based on the strength of the economic data published since the previous SEP in December, especially regarding inflation and the labor market. However, the developments in the banking system created a lot of additional uncertainty over the outlook. The FOMC was anticipating that credit tightening would have a negative impact on economic activity and inflation, especially considering that the rate hikes the Fed had previously implemented were already weighing on business investment. They also thought that there could be an impact on consumer sentiment that could lead to restraint on spending. As we noted at the time of the meeting, the forecasts in the SEP were quite pessimistic. In the end, the median dot for 2023 was left unchanged at 5.1%, corresponding to one more 25-basis-point rate hike from the current level. Regarding the decision to hike rates itself, some FOMC members said that, before the developments in the banking system, they would have considered a 50-basis-point hike.

The minutes make it clear that the Fed itself is uncertain over how many more rate hikes it will implement. At the time of the meeting, FOMC participants felt that the actions by the Fed and other government agencies had helped to calm tensions in the banking system. Given recent developments, we would not expect the banking system to prevent the Fed from hiking if they thought it was needed to bring inflation down. However, some recent economic data, including this morning's inflation report, suggests to us that the Fed is likely close to the end of the rate hiking cycle.

https://www.ubs.com/us/en/wealth-management/insights/market-news/article.1588916.html,Crude oil: Looking for a tightening market,"While oil production can be easily tracked in some countries, particularly in oil exporters with low domestic consumption where one can count the oil tankers, other countries like the US only release final production data with a delay. Calculating oil demand is even more cumbersome. Incomplete and inaccurate data from emerging markets, which account for almost 55% of total demand, and the lack of detailed consumption specifics—e.g., whether end users store barrels in tanks to be used for later or immediately consumed—can result in errors. Another challenge comes from historical revisions, where demand is eventually revised years later.

Inventories as “real-time“ indicators

Data on oil inventories is not perfect either, given some emerging markets don't disclose oil inventories. However, on-land inventory data from the developed world, OECD countries, the industry or government controlled sources are very accurate. Further, thanks to satellites, it's possible to track whether oil is being moved or stored on ships (floating storage) or in above ground tanks thanks to floating roof tanks (not possible for underground caverns). Although we can accurately measure only a small portion of all oil inventories around the world, we can make assumptions about the overall market based on visible oil inventories.

One way to think about it is like a bathtub—if the water (oil inventory) level rises, the market is oversupplied, and vice versa if it’s undersupplied. If the visible part is rising or falling, it's very likely the rest of the bathtub (e.g. commercial oil inventories in emerging markets) is too. This is because a shortage or excess in one location triggers an adjustment of the relative prices at that location, which either attracts oil from the rest of the world to that site or sends it elsewhere. The one exception is if emerging countries like China build up strategic oil reserves, which would send the wrong message; inventories rise not because of an oversupplied market, but due to a government decision.

Oil in transit at high levels

International oil sanctions on Russia have distorted one part of the equation above—oil in transit, which has risen strongly over the last 12 months. In our view, this buildup has been driven by G7 nations with the EU and Australia having stopped importing oil via tankers from Russia. Hence, Russia is diverting larger quantities of its crude to non-EU countries, while Europe is importing its crude from farther locations like North America, South America, Africa, or the Middle East; longer routes mean the shipped oil spends more time on a tanker. We regard this upshift as a structural one, similar to laying out new pipelines that need to be filled.

On-land inventories have been falling

More interesting is the fall in inventories following the strong rise at the start of the year, which was likely driven by the dip in January demand due to mild weather and recovering production from weather disruptions in December. February data suggested a strong increase in demand, resulting in a modestly undersupplied market that month. More recent data shows renewed large on-land inventory drops of more than 30 million barrels over the last three weeks across the US, Europe, Singapore, Japan and Fujairah, suggesting that the market remained undersupplied in March as well. Moreover, exports from Northern Iraq of almost 500,000bpd have been halted since late March and pumping has not yet resumed. While flows may resume in the short term, the interruption and the upcoming voluntary production cuts by nine oil producers should help tighten the oil market further. As a result, we continue to expect oil prices to recover toward USD 100/bbl over the coming quarters.

Different ways to gain exposure

Given our positive price outlook, we reiterate our investment recommendations. With the oil futures curve downward sloping (in backwardation) and higher prices likely ahead, we continue to advise risk-taking investors to add long positions in longer-dated Brent oil contracts. Alternatively, investors can make use of lower spot prices and high option implied volatility by selling Brent’s downside price risks over the next six months. Another way to gain exposure is through Brent crude first generation indexes. Such strategies should benefit from solid roll returns on top of the expected spot appreciation, in our view. But considering oil’s 30–40% volatility, this strategy does require investors to hold an elevated risk appetite. Our preference remains to gain exposure to oil via Brent and not WTI. With elevated political uncertainty, the US administration could, for example, ban exports of refined products (and eventually crude). While there is a low probability of this event, such a decision could heavily weigh on US prices.

https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-job-cuts-must-be-frozen-bankers-leader-says-2023-04-11/,"Credit Suisse job cuts must be frozen, bank employees leader says","













ZURICH, April 11 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and UBS (UBSG.S) must freeze any job cuts planned as part of their emergency merger, the Swiss Bank Employees' Association (SBPV) said on Tuesday, in an open letter to the country's parliament.

SBPV managing director Natalia Ferrara has written to lawmakers to demand they consider staff affected by the collapse of Credit Suisse and halt any job losses until the end of 2023.

""We ... call on you to support our demand for a freeze on layoffs by the end of 2023 in parliament,"" Ferrara wrote in the letter seen by Reuters.

""Politicians must not shirk their responsibility,"" she added.

The Swiss parliament is due to meet in extraordinary session on Tuesday to discuss the state-sponsored rescue of Credit Suisse which took place last month.

UBS agreed to buy Zurich rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.31 billion) in a deal engineered by the government, the central bank and market regulator to avoid a meltdown in the country's financial system.

""For the past three weeks, many of the approximately 17,000 employees at Credit Suisse and the 22,000 UBS employees have been looking at their future with uncertainty,"" said Ferrara, referring to the staff numbers in Switzerland.

Credit Suisse employs 45,000 people globally, while UBS has 74,000 in total.

""In the public debate about the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, there is a lot of talk about numbers, money, regulation, 'too big to fail' or bonuses,"" wrote Ferrara, whose organisation represents 6,000 workers in Switzerland.

""But the affected employees of the two banks remain only a side note. That needs to change.""

UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti last week warned there would be ""change and hard decisions"" ahead following the takeover.

The giant bank created could reduce its workforce by 20%-30%, it has been reported by Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger, with 11,000 jobs being cut in Switzerland.

UBS has said it is too early to speculate on job cuts.

Ferrara said it was not the fault of the bank employees that the rescue was required, adding it would take months for UBS's plans to be worked out.

""Now it is time for the affected employees of the two banks to be given protection and respect,"" Ferrara wrote in the letter that was first published by Swiss newspaper Blick on Tuesday.

""It must not be the case that parliament debates money and technical aspects of the CS rescue for days during the extraordinary session and the people affected are forgotten.""

Evercore gets upgraded by two notches to buy

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) on Wednesday drew an upgrade to buy from hold at UBS on the stock's attractive valuation and lower risk profile than its peers.

UBS also upgraded boutique investment bank Evercore Inc. (EVR) by two notches to buy from sell and adjusted price targets for Morgan Stanley (MS), as well as wealth-management specialists Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW), Ameriprise Financial Inc. (AMP), LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (LPLA), Stifel Financial Corp. (SF) and Regions Financial Corp. (RF).

Analyst Brennan Hawken said Goldman Sachs ""appears well positioned to outperform amidst elevated levels of market volatility"" with potential growth in its asset- and wealth-management business and transactional banking.

Goldman Sachs offers less exposure to consumer deposits and commercial banking than other firms, analysts said.

The investment bank also enjoys an opportunity to accelerate its asset-management business through ""attractively priced mergers and acquisitions,"" Hawken said.

UBS hiked Goldman's price target to $385 a share from $350 a share.

Shares of Goldman Sachs rose 0.8%.

Evercore stock rose 1.5% after UBS rated the bank a buy and lifted its price target to $135 a share from $112.

Hawken said Evercore ""is executing better than expected"" in the downtrodden business of mergers and acquisition advisory services.

While M&A completion volumes were down 50% in the first quarter, UBS is forecasting a less severe 20% drop in its M&A advisory business.

The figure indicates that Evercore's investment-banking relationships ""are strong enough to generate over $500 million per quarter even though financing banks are in a better competitive position,"" Hawken said.

In terms of price-target adjustments, Evercore and Goldman were the only two out of 11 financial stocks covered by UBS to get increases instead of price cuts on Wednesday.

UBS reduced its price target for Morgan Stanley to $98 a share from $108 and reiterated a buy rating.

UBS also reiterated buy ratings on Schwab and Ameriprise and cut their price targets to $70 from $90 for the former and to $285 from $400 for the latter.

UBS reiterated a neutral rating on LPL Financial and cut its price target on the stock to $215 from $235.

Analysts also reiterated a neutral rating on Stifel Financial and cut their price target by $6 to $62. A neutral rating was reiterated for Regions Financial, while its price target was reduced to $100 from $130.

UBS reiterated a buy rating on Houlihan Lokey Inc. (HLI) and cut its price target to $105 from $115. It kept its neutral rating on Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) and reduced its price target to $32 from $40. It also reiterated a sell rating on Moelis & Co. (MC) and reduced its price target to $27 from $30.

https://www.ubs.com/us/en/wealth-management/insights/market-news/article.1589006.html,Fixed income: Carry conscious,"March witnessed a large flight-to-quality bid as concerns over stability in the financial sector pushed the 10-year Treasury yield to slightly below the lower end of our forecast range, at 3.3%, hitting 3.25% during pockets of vulnerability. That 3.25% was also the prior tightening cycle peak witnessed in 2018. We have advocated being longer on interest rate risk since the beginning of this year and added to our exposure at the end of February when the 10-year yield hit 3.97%. While we continue to think the 10-year will end the year near 3.25%, our expectation is for the Federal Reserve to raise rates one more time—in May, by 25 basis points—then shift to a pause.

The difficulty with the current assessment is that when we look at historical 10-year yield trends moving closer to the Fed’s terminal rate dating back to the early 1980s, in some instances yields have trended lower, and in others they have trended higher up to the time the Fed pauses. However, once the Fed pauses, every time since 1984, the 10-year yield has declined, awaiting the next phase of monetary policy—i.e., an easing.

Historically, the first easing has occurred between six and seven months after the Fed pauses. However, given the instability witnessed in March—and the competing narratives over a soft or hard landing—volatility has heightened, and what would normally occur post-pause has been pushed forward. The market has moved the first Fed easing from seven months to a mere two months after the pause, while the 10-year yield has fallen 100bps from the 2022 high of 4.25% reached in October to the 3.25%witnessed last Thursday. Our near-term range in 10-year yield now resides between 3.25% and 3.75%, with the expectation of lower yields in 2H23.

Although we remain with a bullish tilt on interest rates, we do anticipate more stability in the near term, accompanied by a decline in volatility. Within our fixed income portfolio, we have had a least preferred in high yield (HY) and in senior loans versus investment grade (IG) corporates and agency MBS. Our least preferred in loans versus IG corporates was initiated on 20 October when the 10-year yield was at 4.23%. We have guided investors with our view of 10-year yield ranges, which have worked well in deciding when to lock in yields and when not to chase an illiquid, volatile market.

With the market reaching the lower end of our yield range, we are trimming some of our incremental long positioning. With loans being a floating-rate asset class, and IG corporates’ duration at seven years, this performance will be dominated by the move in interest rates versus spread compression. While we maintain the overall up-in-quality bias within our portfolio, we do not believe rates will move materially lower, given the easing priced in and rising recession expectations over the near term, to mitigate the loss in yields between loans and IG corporates. We therefore move to neutral on senior loans and take our profit.

We maintain our slower growth outlook into 2H23 and continue to have agency MBS and IG corporates as our most preferred allocation.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swiss-upper-house-offers-olive-101944382.html,Swiss Parliament Nears Deal on UBS Guarantees as MPs Change Vote,"(Bloomberg) -- Swiss parliament is approaching a deal to push through government guarantees for UBS Group AG’s takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG after a upper houses compromise was met with approval in the lower chamber.

Most Read from Bloomberg

“The majority of our party will vote for this proposal if the government will pursue higher capital ratios and restricted bonuses,” Social Democrat lawmaker Roger Nordmann said in the lower house in Bern on Wednesday. The stricter stance on banks is “a major development,” he said.

The 200-member lower house late on Tuesday voted against the 109 billion francs ($120 billion) in guarantees. While that was a symbolic vote that can’t stop the deal, it clashed with the upper house’s approval earlier in the day.

As a stalemate would force the bill to fail, the upper house earlier today adopted amendments in line with what their lower-house colleagues had demanded. Those provisions seek to adjust the law to limit the risks systemically relevant banks pose to taxpayers.

Comments by Nordmann and other lower-house lawmakers now suggest that a majority will be achieved in both chambers, allowing Switzerland to avoid an embarrassing situation.

Irrespective of the vote, parliament can’t stop the takeover negotiated last month as the government already got approval from a small group of senior lawmakers, which is entitled to act on behalf of parliament in case of urgency.

The key demand the upper house now passed calls on the government to revise banking laws demanding higher capital requirements and restrictions on bonuses. But lawmakers’ agreed wording only stipulates that the executive should “examine” this, not that it is “instructed” to do so.

Story continues

“We are agreed that after the events of March 19 we cannot just move on,” said Pirmin Bischof, a Center Alliance member in the upper house, referring to the day the deal was agreed. “The too-big-to-fail regulation just simply didn’t have any effect. And so we need to ask the government to come up with a changed law that will solve this problem.”

Symbolic Vote

The lower house’s rejection — just before midnight on Tuesday — highlights the anger among lawmakers on both sides of the political spectrum ahead of national elections later this year. An overall rejection would send a signal of Switzerland’s legislative not backing the deal, which some MPs suggested should be done.

“We should only approve a deal when it’s good enough for the Confederation — right now this deal is only good enough for UBS,” said Thomas Minder, adding that a ‘no’ wouldn’t be the “end of the world.”

Lawmakers also acknowledged their lack of power of actually influencing the deal.

“If we could really turn down the loans here, I believe nobody would hesitate,” said Eva Herzog of the Social Democrats.

The standoff is largely symbolic. The government had said that “if parliament refuses subsequent approval, it will be tantamount to a political reprimand” for the group of senior lawmakers that green-lit it, but would have “no legal effect.”

The Credit Suisse crisis three weeks ago has shaken Switzerland, evoking memories of the Great Financial Crisis. The government argued on Tuesday that the creation of a Swiss banking juggernaut was the best solution among a limited number of options.

In addition to state guarantees, the Swiss National Bank offered liquidity assistance. SNB sight deposit numbers published this week suggest that after accessing such money, Credit Suisse may have returned more than half of the funds.

Switzerland’s executive isn’t made up of a coalition or an outright majority, but of seven ministers from the country’s four largest parties. They usually make decisions by consensus and try to find pragmatic compromises — often outside of party lines.

Ministers don’t publicly oppose government decisions, irrespective of their parties’ stance on a matter or how they personally voted behind closed doors.

This setup means that parliament offers parties the most prominent platform to sway voters, which explains aggressive comments in that forum even if they at times lack bite.

More than 50,000 retail locations could permanently shut their doors over the next five years, according to UBS analysts. Those closures would cut the current U.S. store count of about 940,000 by around 5% by the end of 2027, according to the analysts.

A slowdown in consumer spending and tighter credit, coupled with a rise in e-commerce penetration, is expected to sharply accelerate store closures, with mom-and-pop shops most at risk given their lack of capital, according to a research note from a team led by UBS Equity Research Analyst Michael Lasser.

Analysts forecast that e-commerce penetration will rise to 26% from 20% by 2027 with 25% of e-commerce sales fulfilled from stores, up from 15%. The analysts also project that retail sales will continue to grow by 4% annually, which they say is in line with the long-term trend.

However, UBS warned that a protracted recession could damper sales growth and cause upward of 70,000 to 90,000 store closures.

The number of shuttered stores is ""already up significantly"" in 2023 compared to last year, due to heavy hitters like Bed Bath & Beyond, Foot Locker and bankrupt Tuesday Morning trimming their footprints.

Over the past year, Bed Bath & Beyond has initiated a turnaround plan that involved shuttering hundreds of stores. Last month, Foot Locker announced it plans to shutter more than 400 low-performing stores in shopping malls by 2026 as it shifts its focus to new concept stores. Householder merchandise discounter Tuesday Morning filed for Chapter 11 in February.

CEO Doug Wood of Oxford Industries unit Tommy Bahama told FOX Business he isn't surprised by the UBS report, saying this is a ""natural part of the retail cycle.""

The way to think about it is like an apple tree, Wood said.

""You get your best apples when you prune the tree,"" he said. ""That's how I look at it … you're going to prune any underperforming stores that are not meeting consumer or market demands, does help the overall market.""

UBS analysts said this store rationalization is poised to benefit ""larger, well capitalized players"" such as Target, Walmart, Lowe's, Home Depot and Costco.

It's also slated to help ""those with unique differentiations,"" including Floor & Decor Holdings, Academy Sports and Outdoors and National Vision Holdings, which ""stand to capture a disproportionate amount of market share,"" according to the analysts.

For smaller players, it's significantly more difficult.

UBS analysts reported that smaller chains are most at risk of closures given they ""typically have less access to capital needed to invest in developing a robust omni-channel offering.""

An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to a hypothetical investment in the underlying asset or in the underlying constituents. Some of the key risks that apply to the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes in the “Risk Factors” section of the accompanying product supplement. We also urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors concerning an investment in the Notes.

Risks Relating to Return Characteristics

♦ Risk of loss at maturity — The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that UBS will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If UBS does not elect to call the Notes and the final level is less than the downside threshold, you will lose a percentage of your principal amount equal to the underlying return and, in extreme situations, you could lose all of your initial investment.

♦ The stated payout from the issuer applies only at maturity — You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity. If you are able to sell your Notes prior to an issuer call or maturity in the secondary market, you may have to sell them at a loss relative to your initial investment even if the level of the underlying asset at such time is equal to or greater than the downside threshold. All payments on the Notes are subject to the creditworthiness of UBS.

♦ Your potential return on the Notes is limited to the coupons received, you will not participate in any increase in the level of the underlying asset or underlying constituents and you will not have the same rights as holders of any underlying constituents — The return potential of the Notes is limited to the pre-specified coupon rate regardless of any increase of the level of the underlying asset. If UBS elects to call the Notes, you will not receive any coupons or any other payment with respect to any coupon payment date after the call settlement date, and your return on the Notes could be less than if the Notes remained outstanding until maturity. If UBS does not elect to call the Notes, you may be subject to the decline of the underlying asset even though you cannot participate in any increase in the level of the underlying asset. As a result, the return on an investment in the Notes could be less than the return on a hypothetical investment in the underlying asset or underlying constituents. In addition, as an owner of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or any other rights of a holder of the underlying constituents.

♦ A higher coupon rate or lower downside threshold may reflect greater expected volatility of the underlying asset, and greater expected volatility generally indicates an increased risk of loss at maturity — The economic terms for the Notes, including the coupon rate and downside threshold, are based, in part, on the expected volatility of the underlying asset at the time the terms of the Notes are set. “Volatility” refers to the frequency and magnitude of changes in the level of the underlying asset. The greater the expected volatility of the underlying asset as of the trade date, the greater the expectation is as of that date that the final level could be less than the downside threshold and, as a consequence, indicates an increased risk of loss. All things being equal, this greater expected volatility will generally be reflected in a higher coupon rate than the yield payable on our conventional debt securities with a similar maturity or on otherwise comparable securities, and/or a lower downside threshold than those terms on otherwise comparable securities. Therefore, a relatively higher coupon rate may indicate an increased risk of loss. Further, a relatively lower downside threshold may not necessarily indicate that the Notes have a greater likelihood of a return of principal at maturity. You should be willing to accept the downside market risk of the underlying asset and the potential to lose a significant portion or all of your initial investment.

♦ UBS may elect to call the Notes and the Notes are subject to reinvestment risk — UBS may elect to call the Notes at its discretion in whole, but not in part, on any call date regardless of the closing level of the underlying asset on such call date. If UBS elects to call your Notes early, you will no longer have the opportunity to receive any coupons after the applicable call settlement date. UBS may elect to call the Notes as early as the first call date and therefore you may not have the opportunity to receive any coupons after the applicable call settlement date. In the event UBS elects to call the Notes, there is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds at a comparable rate of return for a similar level of risk. Further, UBS’ right to call the Notes may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes in the secondary market.

It is more likely that UBS will elect to call the Notes prior to maturity when the remaining coupons payable on the Notes are greater than the interest that would be payable on other instruments issued by UBS of comparable maturity, terms and credit rating trading in the market. The greater likelihood of UBS calling the Notes in that environment increases the risk that you will not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the called Notes in an equivalent investment with a similar coupon rate. To the extent you are able to reinvest such proceeds in an investment comparable to the Notes, you may incur transaction costs such as dealer discounts and hedging costs built into the price of the new notes. UBS is less likely to call the Notes prior to maturity when the remaining coupons payable on the Notes are less than the interest that would be payable on other comparable instruments issued by UBS. Therefore, the Notes are more likely to remain outstanding when the remaining amount payable on the Notes is less than what would be payable on other comparable instruments.",[],

The upper house gave its green light earlier in the day.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Lawmakers from both sides of the political spectrum again lined up to blame the government, regulators and the bank’s management for failures around the takeover last month. Two hours into the debate in the lower house, it wasn’t clear if a vote on the guarantees would be held Tuesday night.

Damien Cottier, an MP with the Liberal-Radicals, called the day the deal was struck a “day of shame” for Switzerland before going on to call it the “least-bad and least risky” option.

Cottier’s tone reflects that of many frustrated lawmakers who are critical — and in an election year want to be seen as being so — of the banks and the government while at the same time are wary of trying to block the deal. Though parliament doesn’t have the power to derail the takeover, the extraordinary session has forced the government to once again defend the unpopular emergency takeover by UBS Group AG announced on March 19.

In that vein, Swiss President Alain Berset opened the lower-house debate after 7pm local time by saying Credit Suisse’s “negative spiral” spurred his government into action. Temporary nationalisation, a forced bankruptcy and orderly wind-down of the bank were all considered but rejected in favor of the UBS takeover, he said.

The government, Swiss National Bank and Swiss banking regulator Finma “acted in a decisive manner to restore confidence,” Berset said.

Earlier in the day, more than a dozen lawmakers in the upper house voiced their grievances. Their concerns varied from being circumvented in the emergency legislation, to regulatory lapses that allowed Credit Suisse’s failings to go un-addressed, to demanding accountability for the bank’s management.

“The legal possibilities against the bankers responsible and the possibilities to claw back bonuses need to be exhausted to the fullest extent,” said the president of the Free Democrats Thierry Burkart.

Some legislators called for greater powers for the financial regulator, Finma, amid a broader review of too-big-to-fail rules for the sector, while others asked for a parliamentary inquiry commission. Quick legislative changes are unlikely though, as became apparent during the debate.

The deal — described by Berset earlier as the best option to re-establish confidence in markets — created a banking giant whose assets are more than twice the size of the Swiss economy.

Job Cuts

Politicians and business leaders have voiced worries that the combined lender will have excessive market power, leading to a loss of competition. Despite the risks involved in integrating Credit Suisse, UBS stands to become a banking “powerhouse” post merger, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in a note Tuesday.

UBS, already one of the world’s largest wealth managers, is now taking over a key rival for a fraction of the value of its assets and receiving as much as 9 billion Swiss francs in government loss guarantees.

Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter made clear that if these guarantees turned out to be not enough, it would be up to parliament to decide on an extension. The government and UBS agreed on the lender taking on the first 5 billion francs in potential losses, before the administration steps in for the next 9 billion.

Before the takeover, Credit Suisse had already planned to cut as many as 9,000 jobs worldwide over the coming years. The overlaps between the two banks’ businesses will likely lead to that number rising, though executives including UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher have said that it’s too early to say how big the cuts will be.

‘Finma Failed’

Finma didn’t move in time, said Heidi Z’graggen, upper-house member of the Center Alliance.

“Finma’s job is to protect shareholder rights and ensure functioning of the financial center,” she said. “At this, Finma failed.”

A parliamentary inquiry commission is necessary to answer whether the financial regulator, the Swiss National Bank and the finance ministry reacted properly, she said. Such a body would have subpoena powers to summon witnesses.

Given the merger has been met with little public enthusiasm, parliament is also trying to curtail government powers in the future: They are attempting to block the use of emergency measures to push through deals like this.

https://www.ubs.com/us/en/wealth-management/insights/market-news/article.1588825.html,Diverging outlooks suggest staying selective,"CIO keeps US equities as least preferred versus other regions and within US corporate credit keep investment grade as most preferred and high yield least preferred. (ddp)

Bank failures will lead to tighter credit conditions, a negative for growth, but the economy is showing resilience and the labor market hasn’t shown major cracks. So while tighter credit raises recession odds, it’s unlikely to start before the back half of the year.

The outlook is uncertain, but market pricing reflects divergent views across equities, fixed income, and other assets. The fall in US Treasury yields along with expected Fed rate cuts this year indicates the bond market is pricing for a recession to begin by the summer. In contrast, the S&P 500 is less than 2% off its 2023 high, more consistent with an economic soft-landing. Oil repriced about 10% lower after the bank failures, while credit spreads widened, indicating higher recession risk. Given these macro risks and market pricing we updated our asset allocation guidance this month by downgrading equities overall to least preferred and upgrading overall fixed income to most preferred. We keep US equities as least preferred versus other regions and within US corporate credit keep investment grade as most preferred and high yield least preferred.

The preference for fixed income over equities is predicated on a better risk-reward outlook for high quality bonds than stocks in 2023. The preference change does not stem from a bearish outlook for equities overall. Our year-end S&P 500 price target of 3,800 implies modest declines, but will likely come with large

market swings. The lower risk in high quality bonds with likely mid-single digit returns is more attractive in our view.

With the Fed likely near finished hiking rates, yields have likely peaked. As such, investors should actively manage liquidity portfolios and be prepared for potential rate cuts that could lead to reinvestment risk. Similarly, buying quality bonds in fixed income portfolios can hedge against further equity downside and credit risk in lower-quality fixed income and possible decline in Treasury yields.

While the bank stress isn’t limited to the US, the consequences for growth will likely be greatest here. The decline of the US dollar during this stress period indicates a negative spillover to the rest of the world should not be large. That fact, in conjunction with peak rates, leads us to recommend investors position for dollar weakness.

Within equities we recommend investors diversify beyond the US and growth. US large-cap growth stocks are expensive relative to value stocks and other regions, so we stay least preferred. Within US equity sectors we shift to a more defensive bias this month and are now most preferred on consumer staples, industrials and utilities, while least preferred on financials, information technology, and consumer discretionary. This month we also downgraded the energy and real estate sectors to neutral. Outside of the US the China reopening story is gaining steam. Relatively cheap valuations and better earnings prospects keep us most preferred on emerging market equities and hard-currency sovereign bonds.

Consistent with our recommendation to invest in real assets, commodities overall and oil specifically remain most preferred. We also upgrade gold to most preferred. In general, oil and commodities are already pricing in a high risk of recession, while supply constraints should become more binding as the year progresses, especially in light of China’s reopening.

♦ You are exposed to the market risk of each underlying asset — Your return on the Notes is not linked to a basket consisting of the underlying assets. Rather, it will be contingent upon the performance of each individual underlying asset. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of assets, in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all of the components of the basket, you will be exposed equally to the risks related to each underlying asset. Poor performance by any one of the underlying assets over the term of the Notes will negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by a positive performance by any other underlying asset. For instance, you will receive a negative return equal to the underlying return of the least performing underlying asset if UBS does not elect to call the Notes and the final level of one underlying asset is less than its downside threshold, even if the underlying return of each other underlying asset is positive or has not declined as much. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of each underlying asset.

♦ Because the Notes are linked to the least performing underlying asset, you are exposed to a greater risk of no contingent coupons and losing a significant portion or all of your initial investment at maturity than if the Notes were linked to a single underlying asset or fewer underlying assets — The risk that you will not receive any contingent coupons and lose a significant portion or all of your initial investment in the Notes is greater if you invest in the Notes than the risk of investing in substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of only one underlying asset or to fewer underlying assets. With more underlying assets, it is more likely that the closing level of an underlying asset will be less than its coupon barrier on any observation date or that the final level of an underlying asset will be less than its downside threshold than if the Notes were linked to a single underlying asset or fewer underlying assets. In addition, the lower the correlation between a pair of underlying assets, the greater the likelihood that one of the underlying assets will decline to a closing level that is less than its coupon barrier on any observation date or a final level that is less than its downside threshold. Although the correlation of the underlying assets’ performance may change over the term of the Notes, the economic terms of the Notes, including the contingent coupon rate, downside thresholds and coupon barriers are determined, in part, based on the correlation of the underlying assets’ performance calculated using our internal models at the time when the terms of the Notes are finalized. All things being equal, a higher contingent coupon rate and lower downside thresholds and coupon barriers are generally associated with lower correlation of the underlying assets. Therefore, if the performance of a pair of underlying assets is not correlated to each other or is negatively correlated, the risk that you will not receive any contingent coupons or that the final level of any underlying asset will be less than its downside threshold is even greater despite lower coupon barriers and downside thresholds, respectively. With three underlying assets, it is more likely that the performance of one pair of underlying assets will not be correlated, or will be negatively correlated. Therefore, it is more likely that you will not receive any contingent coupons, that the final level of any underlying asset will be less than its downside threshold and that you will lose a significant portion or all of your initial investment at maturity.

♦ Market risk — The return on the Notes, which may be negative, is directly linked to the performance of the underlying assets and indirectly linked to the performance of the underlying constituents and their issuers (the “underlying constituent issuers”). The levels of the underlying assets can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to each underlying asset or its underlying constituents, such as stock or commodity price volatility, earnings, financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock and commodity market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic, political and other conditions. Recently, the coronavirus infection has caused volatility in the global financial markets and a slowdown in the global economy. Coronavirus or any other communicable disease or infection may adversely affect the underlying constituent issuers and, therefore, the underlying assets. You, as an investor in the Notes, should conduct your own investigation into the investment adviser of each underlying asset (each, an “underlying asset issuer”) and the underlying assets for your Notes. For additional information regarding the underlying assets and the underlying asset issuers, please see “Information About the Underlying Assets” herein and the underlying asset issuers' SEC filings referred to in that section. We urge you to review financial and other information filed periodically by the underlying asset issuers with the SEC.

♦ There can be no assurance that the investment view implicit in the Notes will be successful — It is impossible to predict whether and the extent to which the levels of the underlying assets will rise or fall. There can be no assurance that the closing level of each underlying asset will be equal to or greater than its coupon barrier on each observation date or, if UBS does not elect to call the Notes, that the final level of each underlying asset will be equal to or greater than its downside threshold. The levels of the underlying assets will be influenced by complex and interrelated political, economic, financial and other factors that affect the underlying constituent issuers. You should be willing to accept the downside risks of owning equities in general and the underlying assets in particular, and the risk of losing a significant portion or all of your initial investment.

♦ There is no affiliation between the underlying asset issuers or any underlying constituent issuer and UBS, and UBS is not responsible for any disclosure by such issuers — We are not affiliated with the underlying asset issuers or any underlying constituent issuer. We and our affiliates may currently, or from time to time in the future engage in business with the underlying asset issuers or any underlying constituent issuer. However, we are not affiliated with the underlying asset issuers or any underlying constituent issuer and are not responsible for such issuers' public disclosure of information, whether contained in SEC filings or otherwise. You, as an investor in the Notes, should conduct your own investigation into the underlying assets, underlying constituents, the underlying asset issuers or any underlying constituent issuer. Neither the underlying asset issuers nor any underlying constituent issuer are involved in the Notes offered hereby in any way and have no obligation of any sort with respect to your Notes. Neither the underlying asset issuers nor any underlying constituent issuer have any obligation to take your interests into consideration for any reason, including when taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of, and return on, your Notes.

♦ The value of an underlying asset may not completely track the value of its underlying constituents — Although the trading characteristics and valuations of an ETF will usually mirror the characteristics and valuations of its underlying constituents, the level of an ETF may not completely track the value of its underlying constituents. The level of each underlying asset will reflect transaction costs and fees that the underlying constituents in which an ETF invests do not have. In addition, although an ETF may be currently listed for trading on an exchange, there is no assurance that an active trading market will continue for an ETF or that there will be liquidity in the trading market.

♦ Fluctuation of NAV — The net asset value (the “NAV”) of an ETF may fluctuate with changes in the market value of its underlying constituents. The market prices of an ETF may fluctuate in accordance with changes in NAV and supply and demand on the applicable stock exchanges. In addition, the market price of an ETF may differ from its NAV per share; an ETF may trade at, above or below its NAV per share, meaning the level of each underlying asset may not reflect its NAV.",[],

According to its latest median dot plot projection, the Fed is set to deliver one more 25bps increase this year before pausing for the rest of 2023.

But irrespective of whether the Fed delivers a further rate increase, we see reasons to be cautious about the outlook for the US economy and corporate earnings.

US inflation remains sticky and well above target. US inflation has remained stubbornly high despite the 475bps of cumulative rate hikes. March CPI data due later today will provide evidence on whether US inflation remains sticky. According to a Reuters poll, the consensus forecast is for headline CPI to ease to 5.1% year-over-year from 6% in February. However, the more important core inflation measure is expected to have increased 0.4% m/m in March from 0.3% in February, bringing annual core CPI up to 5.6% y/y from 5.5% previously.

Even if the Fed opts to pause next month, with US inflation still running well above its 2% target, the central bank will want to see the hikes delivered thus far having the desired effect of bringing inflation down closer to that target before it can consider any rate cuts (i.e., a pivot).

The real US economy is starting to hurt from the impact of tightening to date. US recession risks are rising, as evidenced by the latest March ISM manufacturing PMI falling to 46.3, its lowest level since May 2020 and the fifth consecutive month in contraction territory. The US labor market is also starting to cool, with March nonfarm payrolls and JOLTS data showing slower wage growth and lower job openings.

Credit conditions are tightening as banking sector turmoil adds to the pain from rate hikes. According to the Dallas Fed Banking Conditions Survey conducted 21–27 March, commercial and industrial loans, real estate lending, and loan volumes have fallen while credit standards have continued to tighten. This concern was also highlighted by Chicago Fed Chief Austan Goolsbee, who said yesterday that the US central bank should exercise “prudence and patience” in raising rates as it needs to assess how much credit conditions have tightened following the banking turmoil. Historically, tighter credit conditions have been correlated with weaker corporate earnings.

So, with the US economy cooling and a Fed pivot not imminent, we believe the environment for equities will remain challenging in the coming months. We are least preferred on global equities, including the US, where we expect earnings to contract 4.5% this year. We prefer bonds to equities, and we like high grade (government), investment grade, and sustainable bonds relative to high yield bonds. Apart from the potential tailwinds from an eventual Fed pivot, we think that high-quality bonds can offer defensive traits to a portfolio in the event of a sharper economic downturn.

In year-over-year terms, the inflation rate slowed to 5%, the lowest since May 2021 and down from the peak of 9.1% last June. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, increased 0.4%. Both bond and equity markets rallied after the release.

Today's report provides clearer signs that inflation is cooling off. Over the past few months, shelter has been one of the biggest inflation drivers, even though data on new leases shows that rent increases have slowed sharply. In March, rent of primary residence slowed to 0.5%, down from 0.8% in February, and given the lags in the data, it is likely that rents will continue to slow over the course of 2023. As shown in the chart, at long last it appears that core services inflation has peaked. In the other direction, it appears that the period of maximum deflationary pressure on goods is also over. Some prices that became overheated at the height of the pandemic have fallen back to more normal levels, leaving less room for further declines. We expect goods inflation to remain subdued, but it is unlikely to drag down overall inflation as much as it has in recent months.

In our view, the data will not be enough for the Fed to declare victory over inflation, and we look for another rate hike at the next FOMC meeting on 3 May. However, if the data continues to show the labor market and inflation cooling off, this could be the last hike of the cycle.

Global currency regimes are sticky: The US dollar dominates financial markets and international trade. Changes in the world’s dominant currency have historically taken a long time to materialize. Even as great economic powers rise and fall, their currencies’ reserve status tend to survive well past the peak of their influence. The latest IMF survey on the currency composition of global foreign exchange reserves reveals that the share of US dollars held by central banks still stands at almost 60%. The greenback is also used in over 40% of every global payment and dominates 85% of trade finance contracts, according to SWIFT.

As a result, the US continues to attract large flows of foreign investment. Of course, the US must treat the privilege of being able to issue the world’s preeminent currency with respect.

Geopolitics enter the equation: Although shifts in the global currency order typically take place at a glacial pace, rising geopolitical tensions can trigger quicker adjustments. China, for instance, is working to accelerate the yuan's internationalization as relations remain tense with the US. Although these efforts are unlikely to yield overnight success, they plant the seeds of a more diversified currency landscape ahead.

China, for instance, is working to accelerate the yuan's internationalization as relations remain tense with the US. Although these efforts are unlikely to yield overnight success, they plant the seeds of a more diversified currency landscape ahead. Gold has become the diversifier of choice: Last year saw very strong central bank buying of gold following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, marking the 13th consecutive year of net purchases and the highest level of annual demand on record dating back to 1950. As the yellow metal carries no credit or counter-party risk, some central banks may deem it as being better insulated from financial sanctions.

Conclusion and investment implications

All in all, we think the dollar's reign will live on. At the same time, it will likely make some room for competitors along the way.

From a cyclical perspective, we expect the US dollar to weaken as the US growth and interest rate premium relative to the rest of the world erodes in the coming months. It is important to note that our call for a weaker US dollar in the near future is not based on the assumption of a declining global currency status.

With this in mind, we recommend investors to diversify their dollar cash or fixed income holdings, reduce allocations to US equities, or position in options or structured strategies that could deliver positive returns in the event of dollar weakness. On a relative basis, we prefer the Australian dollar as well as the Swiss franc, euro, pound, and yen.



We also see gold as an attractive portfolio diversifier and target a price of USD 2,200/oz over the next 12 months. Higher investor confidence that the Federal Reserve is approaching the peak in interest rates should bolster demand for the yellow metal. We also see official sector demand remaining strong for at least another year. In addition, gold has a good track record as a hedge against historical episodes of financial stress.

(Getty Images)

Where are the opportunities in fixed income?

Government bond yields have fallen from their early March highs as banking sector turbulence added to fears of slowing economic growth. We don't think a full-scale banking crisis is likely. But we do see a higher probability that central bank rate-hiking cycles will end sooner. At the time of writing, markets are pricing a peak in the US federal funds rate in May.

With the likely end of the rate-hike cycle approaching, and risks to the US growth outlook mounting, we think it's time to increase exposure to bonds. Yields, though off their peak, still look attractive, and we see the potential for capital gains in the event of a deeper economic slowdown. We think investors holding excess cash should consider opportunities to lock in today's yields. We prefer high grade (government), investment grade, and sustainable bonds relative to high yield bonds. We also like emerging market bonds.

Can alternatives help navigate correlated markets?

Alternative assets like hedge funds and private market investments can provide investors with the opportunity to diversify their sources of return at a time of heightened uncertainty in global markets, if they are able to tolerate the risks involved.

In hedge funds, we think strategies that can capitalize on market dislocations while providing stable diversification benefits should be well positioned in a year when uncertainty and macro risks are likely to stay elevated. We like macro managers’ ability to take long/short positions across a range of asset classes, regions and financial instruments; equity market neutral funds’ appeal in providing uncorrelated returns; and multi-strategy funds’ diversified approach and versatility. Meanwhile, private market secondaries and distressed strategies could be well positioned to buy assets at attractive valuations.

Investors in alternative assets must be able to lock up capital for longer and should consider risks like reduced liquidity, higher costs, and complexities.

What are the implications of China's recovery?

China's reopening has paved the way for an economic recovery in 2023. The official March PMI data underlined that the rebound remains on track. Backed by a resurgence in consumption and resilient investment, we expect Chinese GDP growth of around 5.5% y/y this year.

MSCI China fell 1% last week after three weeks of gains. But we see further upside for Chinese equities, supported by strong earnings growth. We retain a most preferred view on emerging market equities, including Chinese stocks, and we see opportunities in reopening beneficiaries. We also think select property developer bonds, commodities, the yuan, and the Australian dollar may emerge as winners as China's economy continues to pick up.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse















ZURICH, April 8 (Reuters) - UBS's (UBSG.S) multi-billion state-sponsored takeover of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) should proceed smoothly without political obstructions, Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said in an interview published on Saturday.

The Swiss parliament is due to hold an extraordinary session next week to discuss the emergency merger engineered by the Swiss authorities after Credit Suisse came close to collapse.

Nearly 260 billion Swiss francs ($287 billion) of liquidity support and state guarantees have been offered to back the takeover and avoid a financial meltdown the bank's uncontrolled failure could have triggered.

""There is a merger agreement between UBS and CS, for its part the cabinet has made a commitment to the national bank to provide CS with liquidity in order to ensure stability,"" Keller-Sutter told newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft.

""The guarantee agreement with UBS is still being negotiated. In many committee meetings, I got the impression that politicians definitely don't want to jeopardise the takeover,"" she added.

""I don't see any stumbling blocks at the moment.""

Completing the merger was the highest priority, the minister said, who defended the government's intervention last month, which critics have said came too late and promised too much taxpayer support for a bank that paid out billions in bonuses to executives.

""The primary goal of the Federal Council was to ensure the stability of the Swiss economy and the Swiss financial center and to prevent an international financial crisis,"" she said.

""Under the circumstances, it was and is the best possible choice, which also places the least burden on the state and the taxpayer,"" Keller-Sutter said.

The new combined bank will have $1.6 trillion in assets - double the size of the entire Swiss economy - and more than 120,000 staff and Keller-Sutter said the structure of UBS would have to be considered in the future.

""UBS will have to hold more equity after the takeover. This will rather force them to shrink,"" Keller-Sutter said.

Switzerland's Competition Commission can also make recommendations, the minister added.

The risks to the taxpayer were also acceptable - even though the government could assume up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS by the takeover.

Keller-Sutter criticised the culture at Credit Suisse, which she said had set the wrong incentives and had not learned from previous scandals and prosecutions.

The minister also defended the writedown of AT1 bonds to zero, a controversial part of the rescue.

""These are high-risk bonds with high yields, sometimes over 9%,"" Keller-Sutter said. ""The prospectus for these bonds makes it clear that if a company claims indirect government aid, they can be written off.""

The special parliamentary session next week was important, she added, and a welcome opportunity to get to the truth of the Credit Suisse debacle.

""At the moment, parliament can 'only' advise on the commitment credit, but it also has the opportunity to comment on the case and play an active role in the process.""

https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/our-approach/marketnews/article.1588915.html,Structured investments: Tap into rising commodity prices,"Commodities can help protect against the risk of persistent inflation and a variety of geopolitical shocks. Allocating to a commodity-linked structured investment can enable you to potentially benefit from higher commodity prices, while mitigating the equity-like downside that commodities have exhibited in the past.

Our commodity analysts expect crude oil prices and other commodity prices to continue to rise, with an expected return of about 20% for broad commodities over the coming 12 months. Key drivers include accelerating growth in China, persistent production challenges, low inventories, and ongoing weather risks.

This constructive outlook has been further bolstered by the surprise announcement that Saudi Arabia and eight other oil producers will be implementing a voluntary production cut of 1.66 million barrels per day, effective from May to December. WTI crude oil futures—which had fallen from USD 120 per barrel in June 2022 to as low as USD 65 per barrel in March 2023—have staged a strong rally since the early April announcement but remain well below our analysts' USD 105 per barrel forecast for May 2024.

To the extent that rising commodity prices continue to put upward pressure on inflation, this trend could lead to further interest rate hikes from central banks. An allocation to commodities could therefore help protect against the risk that further rate hikes would pose to both stocks and bonds. In 2022, faster-than-expected rate hikes contributed to sharp losses for stocks (down 19%) and government bonds (down 12%), while the Bloomberg Commodity Index rallied 16%.

Implementation considerations

While we expect commodity prices to rise modestly from here, a direct investment in commodities could expose investors to significant downside risks if economic growth were to stumble. After all, commodities tend to trade with stock-like volatility, and commodity prices have staged sharp selloffs in previous recessions (WTI crude oil futures even traded in negative territory at one point in 2020).

Therefore, as an alternative to directly investing in commodities or futures markets, investors may prefer to use structured investments. Based on current market pricing, it may be possible to invest in a structured investment that offers enhanced upside potential and contingent downside protection for investors who are willing to lock up their investment capital for 3 years.

In Figures 1 and 2 , we have summarized the hypothetical historical returns of a 3-year structured investment with terms in line with those generally available at the time of writing: 140% of the upside potential of the underlying index, with a 25% contingent downside trigger. With these terms, there are three possible outcomes, based on the underlying index's return at maturity:

If the index is higher than its starting value, the investor receives their original investment plus 140% of the index's gain.

If the index is down more than 25% from its starting value, the investor participates fully in the index's downside, receiving their original investment minus the index's loss.

If the index is down less than 25% from its starting value, the investor receives their full principal value at maturity).

In Figures 1 and 2 we estimate historical returns assuming an underlying index of the Bloomberg Commodity Index 3 Month Forward—rather than the Bloomberg Commodity Index, which invests by purchasing short-dated futures—in order to reduce the negative impact of rolling futures contracts (see “A note regarding the underlying index” at the end of this report for more details).

Historically, a structured investment with these terms would have outperformed the Bloomberg Commodity Index Total Return (which combines the returns of the Bloomberg Commodity Index with the returns on cash collateral invested in 3-month Treasury Bills) in about 91% of the 5,831 rolling 3-year periods that we analyzed during this period, with an average outperformance of about 7.7% p.a. (25% non-annualized). In the other 9% of rolling periods, the Total Return Index outperformed as the return on the cash collateral exceeded the rise in commodity futures prices.

Important note regarding structured investments

When considering how structured investments could fit within your portfolio, the appropriate amount and type of structures should take into consideration your objectives as well as your willingness and capacity to accept relevant structured investment risks, such as issuer and underlying asset exposure risk, as well as a sacrifice of some liquidity (there is a limited secondary market for structured investments).

In the case of this structured investment, we recommend against using capital that you might need for cash flow needs in the next 3 years, because there is a limited market for selling structured investments prior to maturity. While a structured investment with these terms would offer some protection against mild losses, it is fully exposed to downside risk beyond the downside trigger threshold—because of this risk to the capital investment, we recommend against investing any funds that are earmarked for a specific goal or cash flow need upon maturity.

If you would like to know more about structured investments, and how they might fit into your portfolio, reach out to your financial advisor, who can help you to put these considerations into context. You can also ask your advisor for a copy of our report, Structured investments: Considering outcome-oriented investments, published 23 March 2020.

A note regarding the underlying index

One headwind to a direct investment in commodities is the “negative roll yield” that can be caused by investing in commodity markets where the futures curve is in contango (the commodity's futures are priced higher than the commodity's spot price). When a market is in contango, investors will tend to lose money when they sell expiring futures to buy the next month's future. This “negative roll yield” can be a significant headwind to returns when compared to investments that avoid buying short-dated futures.

GS, +0.57% on Wednesday drew an upgrade to buy from hold at UBS on the stock’s attractive valuation and lower risk profile than its peers.

UBS also upgraded boutique investment bank Evercore Inc. EVR, +2.02% by two notches to buy from sell and adjusted price targets for Morgan Stanley MS, +0.26% , as well as wealth-management specialists Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW, -0.83% , Ameriprise Financial Inc. AMP, +1.11% , LPL Financial Holdings Inc. LPLA, +1.36% , Stifel Financial Corp. SF, +1.59% and Regions Financial Corp. RF, +0.33% .

Analyst Brennan Hawken said Goldman Sachs “appears well positioned to outperform amidst elevated levels of market volatility” with potential growth in its asset- and wealth-management business and transactional banking.

Goldman Sachs offers less exposure to consumer deposits and commercial banking than other firms, analysts said.

The investment bank also enjoys an opportunity to accelerate its asset-management business through “attractively priced mergers and acquisitions,” Hawken said.

UBS hiked Goldman’s price target to $385 a share from $350 a share.

Shares of Goldman Sachs rose 0.8%.

Evercore stock rose 1.5% after UBS rated the bank a buy and lifted its price target to $135 a share from $112.

Hawken said Evercore “is executing better than expected” in the downtrodden business of mergers and acquisition advisory services.

While M&A completion volumes were down 50% in the first quarter, UBS is forecasting a less severe 20% drop in its M&A advisory business.

The figure indicates that Evercore’s investment-banking relationships “are strong enough to generate over $500 million per quarter even though financing banks are in a better competitive position,” Hawken said.

In terms of price-target adjustments, Evercore and Goldman were the only two out of 11 financial stocks covered by UBS to get increases instead of price cuts on Wednesday.

UBS reduced its price target for Morgan Stanley to $98 a share from $108 and reiterated a buy rating.

UBS also reiterated buy ratings on Schwab and Ameriprise and cut their price targets to $70 from $90 for the former and to $285 from $400 for the latter.

UBS reiterated a neutral rating on LPL Financial and cut its price target on the stock to $215 from $235.

Analysts also reiterated a neutral rating on Stifel Financial and cut their price target by $6 to $62. A neutral rating was reiterated for Regions Financial, while its price target was reduced to $100 from $130.

UBS reiterated a buy rating on Houlihan Lokey Inc. HLI, +1.38% and cut its price target to $105 from $115. It kept its neutral rating on Lazard Ltd. LAZ, +1.36% and reduced its price target to $32 from $40. It also reiterated a sell rating on Moelis & Co. MC, +1.92% and reduced its price target to $27 from $30.

GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland’s parliament opened a special session Tuesday to scrutinize the state-imposed takeover of Swiss bank Credit Suisse by rival UBS — and consider strengthening the legal arsenal to better gird against financial blowups .

The debate could run up to three days, with lawmakers voicing — and needing to iron out — disagreements over the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.25 billion) fusion of Switzerland’s top two banks , a thunderclap for a country that prides itself on finesse and acumen in finance.

Swiss authorities stepped in as shares of Credit Suisse plunged last month and depositors pulled their money after the failure of two U.S. banks sparked concerns about the stability of global financial system and the long-troubled lender. Credit Suisse is among 30 “globally systemically important banks,” and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

“The situation on the financial markets has calmed down, but it is not fully stabilized, and our country — Switzerland — has emerged shaken by this painful episode ,” Swiss President Alain Berset said at the session.

He said lawmakers would need to ensure that the legal framework was “as solid as possible to prevent this kind of crisis from happening again.” The executive branch also would look into “too big to fail” rules for key banks passed after the 2008 global financial crisis that may need changing, Berset added.

Lawmakers also are considering accountability for Credit Suisse and concerns about thousands of expected job cuts and looking at state-backed guarantees of over $100 billion aimed at holding the bank together until the merger is completed and buttressing UBS against possible losses .

They also are debating what it will mean for Switzerland to have one giant bank .

Johanna Gapany, a centrist lawmaker and rapporteur for the upper chamber’s finance commission, said the parliamentary panel had made three main proposals: change competition rules in light of the emergence of megabank UBS , examine how Credit Suisse executives might be held accountable and block the executive branch from unilaterally releasing more emergency funds for the rescue plan.

The proposals showed a “clear intention to not only prevent this situation from happening again, but to make sure that the solution protects the interests of citizens as much as possible — thus by taking the least risk with the guarantees that have been provided,” Gapany said.

ADVERTISEMENT

Despite the talk, few concrete results were expected from the session, which is primarily to flesh out ideas — and possibly some vitriol — from lawmakers who all face reelection this fall.

Yvan Lengwiler, an economics professor at the University of Basel, suggested that the debate would play into a longtime “tug-of-war” between lawmakers who have lobbied in favor of Swiss banks over the years and others who have long sought to stiffen regulation.

“It seems that the pendulum, after this debacle we’ve seen, has clearly shifted towards strengthening,” he said. “Two years from now … the political situation might be very different, and it could be quite difficult to get this through parliament.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Jakob Stark, an upper-house lawmaker from the populist, right-wing Swiss People’s Party, said the rescue of Credit Suisse was “was probably right and ultimately unavoidable” but that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority — known as FINMA — must become ”more decisive.”

“It should, for instance, get the authority to impose fines, but then it should also really impose the fines, and particularly on the big institutions,” Stark said of the regulator. “My feeling is that it was too considerate toward Credit Suisse, perhaps because of a legal basis that wasn’t sufficiently clear.”

The Swiss attorney general’s office has already opened a probe into events surrounding Credit Suisse ahead of the takeover, and the executive branch last week ordered tens of millions in cuts to the bonuses of top Credit Suisse executives.

Lawmakers largely were expected to line up behind the rescue plan — even if reluctantly for some — and were not yet expected to authorize a parliamentary investigation of the epochal rescue of Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old pillar of Swiss banking.

ADVERTISEMENT

Lengwiler, who specializes in financial market regulation, noted that the combined bank will have a balance sheet that will be twice as large as Switzerland’s annual economy.

That’s nothing new: Both Credit Suisse and UBS had bigger balance sheets than the Swiss economy before the 2008 financial crisis. But this combined bank will be unprecedented in size and heft, presenting new challenges for government officials.

“What’s new here is that it’s the only kid on the block now,” Lengwiler said. “UBS is really the only game in town and … has become extremely dominant, and that is a problem for Switzerland.”

“It’s maybe too large for the country,” he added.

https://beststocks.com/ubs-group-downgrades-rating-on-jd-com-stock-causi/,"UBS Group Downgrades Rating on JD.com Stock, Causing Market Stir and Uncertainty for Shareholders","Recently, investment analysts from UBS Group downgraded their rating on JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) stock. The shift came as a surprise to some, and caused a stir in the financial world. This change in recommendation is notable because it could result in significant changes to the market value of the information services provider.

The reasons for this rating reduction are not entirely clear at this time, but there have been shifts in institutional investors’ positions. Gateway Investment Advisers LLC increased its holdings by 3%, purchasing an additional 176 shares during Q4 of 2020. Compagnie Lombard Odier SCmA also boosted its position during this time period by an additional 200 shares. Harbor Investment Advisory LLC experienced a more substantial increase of 43.8% with the purchase of an additional 203 shares.

E Fund Management Co. Ltd., during Q3 of last year, purchased an additional 239 shares which lifted their position by 3.8%. First Manhattan Co., too saw a rise in its overall ownership stake with the addition of another 244 shares – an increase of 32.5%.

This is a significant development that could impact the future prospects of JD.com as it deals with increasing competition and technological advancements in e-commerce space. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how significant this downgrade will prove to be over time and what other effects or events may arise that will further shape investor sentiment toward this particular company.

Institutional investors and hedge funds own nearly one-fifth of JD.com’s stock, indicating that major players closely follow movements at several levels within the company’s hierarchy. Investors who plan on holding onto shares should pay close attention to any updates or reports that might shed light on these developments.

While uncertainty still exists about how long-term investors stand on Jd.com shares, shareholders should brace themselves for more volatility ahead given such unpredictability surrounding institutional investors’ interests.

In summary, all eyes are firmly focused on JD.com shares after the recent downgrade by UBS Group, which is an indicator that there might be troubles brewing for the company. The shifts in institutional investors’ positions only add to this uncertainty, making this a challenging period for long-term shareholders of JD.com. Only time and further events will shed more light on the future trajectory of JD.com’s stock as investors closely monitor updates from inside and outside the company.



JD.com’s Recent Analyst Reports and Market Trends: An Overview

JD.com: A Look at Recent Analyst Reports and Market Trends

In today’s tumultuous market, investors are seeking guidance from those who understand the workings of industry and business. Thus, recent reports on JD.com by Loop Capital, BOCOM International, Susquehanna, Barclays, and Morgan Stanley have given investors some insight into where the e-commerce company currently stands.

Of note is Loop Capital’s downgrade of JD from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating. In addition to this change in their assessment, they also reduced their price target for the stock from $82.00 to $49.00. Similarly, BOCOM International downgraded JD from “buy” to “neutral” while Susquehanna and Barclays both reduced their price targets for the company as well.

Despite these recent changes in ratings and assessments by industry experts, JD still maintains a consensus rating of “Hold”. According to data from Bloomberg, the current consensus price target for JD is $67.42.

It’s important to note that all this comes as JD stock opened at $36.95 on Thursday with a 1-year low of $33.17 and high of $68.29. When it comes to financials, JD has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.11 with a current ratio of 1.32 and quick ratio of 1.02.

JD operates through three primary segments: retail, logistics, and new businesses such as its cloud computing arm JD Cloud or its messaging platform WeChat-like service Jingxi Xiaodian (京喜小店). It offers sales on electronics products such as audio-visual equipment as well as general merchandise which includes books & beauty products among others.

The e-commerce giant has been through challenging times politically ad culturally since last year but with positive annual revenue figures totaling over USD28 billion investors expect growing recovery and stability in coming years.

Undoubtedly, the economy is constantly shifting, and company assessments are not always straightforward. However, these recent reports and market trends provide some insight into JD.com’s current position in the business world. Investors will continue to watch JD’s decisions and strategic moves with curiosity as industry experts hope for stability in the near future.","['Roberto Liccardo', 'Financial', 'Marketing Expert At Entrepreneur.Com', 'Covering Finance', 'Sales', 'Marketing Strategies.

- Finally taking a look at Microsoft shares, closing the day in the red, off just over 2%. UBS warning of further troubles in the cloud sector. Analyst, Karl Kersten, saying that he wrote in a note to clients that quote, ""Customer efforts to optimize or trim their cloud spend will be deeper and last longer than most things."" Now key cloud companies lagging behind today, along with Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Snowflake, all moving to the downside. Weakness in the cloud was something we started to hear about during last earnings season, Josh, when we started to see some of these larger names post smaller growth numbers. That was clearly concern there for analysts at the time. It looks like it might be a little bit longer of a runway here until we start to see things turn around.

- Yeah, UBS talked to over 20 different large consumers of these products, and I thought it was interesting to see that they had seen a more of a tick down since they last talked to them three months ago. You noted that AWS and Azure, we had already seen a slowdown. So to continue to see that slowdown will be interesting to see how that translates to earnings in a couple of weeks. Their specific point on Microsoft I thought was interesting, too, Seana, talking about just the Microsoft stock price we're showing. They're up almost 20% year to date.

And their argument for Microsoft basically being that AI unit is already priced in. So you already have the price in there with that 20% bump. Now you're looking at a Azure, which was sort of the growth story before, and that might be slowing down. So then what does that mean for the outlook of Microsoft? It gets a little bit murkier when we get outside that AI hype train. Although, it is pretty exciting.

- It is exciting. I know, AI was certainly the buzzword of last earnings season. We'll see whether or not that's a tech buzz word of this earnings season. You got to think a lot of these companies are going to be mentioning that quite a few times, right, Josh? Great job. Thanks so much.",[],

The company, which now has around one-third of its employees based in the U.S., inked its most high-profile stateside deal by putting the UBS name on the Isles’ arena as part of a 20-year pact. “It was an opportunity for us to demonstrate and accelerate our commitment and presence in the U.S.,” said Mesilati. “We viewed that this would be a highly visible destination for visitors across the globe, but also from the New York area, which is extremely important for our ultra-high net worth clients.” Mesilati also noted the timing of the deal, signed in July 2020, meant UBS was taking something of a chance on the bounceback of the live fan experience. “It was very counterintuitive to enter into a naming rights agreement in the middle of a global pandemic,” she said. “But we always had absolute confidence.”

STRONG AS OAK: One key area of collaboration between UBS and the Islanders at the local level has come in the form of the 43 Oak Foundation, a DEI-driven youth hockey program that UBS and the Islanders have pledged $1M toward over a five-year period. The effort, which has seen involvement from both Islanders and UBS execs, focuses on bringing down barriers to playing hockey for underprivileged and minority athletes, serving primarily N.Y. metro area players ages 12-22 by providing transportation, equipment, ice time, funding for travel and other resources -- not to mention mentorship from both Islanders and UBS senior execs. “We work very closely with the players on career development, interview skills,” Mesilati noted when talking about off-ice efforts within the program. “We can have generational impact there.” Participation in the initiative has grown 500% since its start, and has even expanded beyond the N.Y. metro area.

WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Another key sports sponsorship pact for UBS is with the Mercedes F1 team, which counts Lewis Hamilton and George Russell as drivers. Mesilati said the growth of F1 in the U.S. has “extremely important” to UBS -- something she attributed to the popularity of “Drive to Survive” on Netflix. “Miami is a core market for UBS,” Mesilati noted when discussing the race that debuted on the grounds of Hard Rock Stadium last year. “We have a huge percentage of our business in the Miami area. We were extremely over-subscribed. Huge amount of demand from our clients. … We cannot wait for Vegas. … It will be a huge platform for us.” UBS around two years ago also began sponsoring shows on streaming service PlayersTV to promote its wealth management services. That included “Front Office,” a Chris Paul-backed show focused on athlete entrepreneurs such as Michelle Wie, Mookie Betts and Travis Kelce. Two other shows -- “Long Game” and “Level Up” -- are hosted by former NFLer and current UBS exec Wale Ogunleye. “It really worked for us because it enabled a way for us to authentically engage with athletes,” said Mesilati.",[],2023-04-10 00:00:00
https://footwearnews.com/2023/business/retail/ubs-50000-stores-could-close-by-2027-1203444605/,"50,000 Stores Could Close in the Next 5 Years, UBS Says","Store closures are expected to pick up again in 2023 and could total more than 50,000 in the next five years.

That’s according to a recent report from UBS, which found that store closures in 2023 are already up significantly compared to the prior year. In the last few months, various retailers have announced plans to consolidate their store bases and close stores. Foot Locker last month announced a decision to close more than 400 stores locations through 2026 focus on higher-performing doors. Walmart also recently announced a plan to close seven underperforming stores, including its last two pickup and delivery concept locations.

By the end of 2027, UBS estimates that about 50,000 stores will close across the current U.S. store count of about 940,000 stores, meaning there would be less than 5 percent fewer stores by the end of 2027.

Retailers have announced about 2,600 store closures and 5,100 store openings for the year, according to Coresight Research cited in BDO’s bi-annual bankruptcy report. Store openings this year have been mainly led by dollar store and discount chains, which have benefitted from cost-cutting consumers.

As for the reasons for the predicted closures, UBS outlined a few key factors. For starters, the cost to run a store is going up, especially as wages increase and rents stay high. At the same time, a general slowdown in consumer spending, less available credit and e-commerce growth are also to blame.

UBS predicts e-commerce penetration to grow from its current 20 percent to 26 percent by 2027, with 25 percent of online sales being fulfilled from stores. This model also assumes that retail sales grow 4 percent annually.

The National Retail Federation forecast that retail sales will grow between 4 percent and 6 percent in 2023, with sales reaching between $5.13 trillion and $5.23 trillion this year. While NRF has said a recession is unlikely in 2023, a recession could result in even more store closures, UBS said.

The stores at risk of closures are those of smaller chains, department stores and specialty retailers with mainly discretionary items.

“In our view, these smaller chains and mom and pops are most at risk of closures given these firms typically have less access to capital needed to invest in developing a robust omnichannel offering,” UBS analysts wrote in the report.

Meanwhile, off-price retailers and dollar stores are set to continue to grow their presence as they resonate with cost-conscious consumers.

Like store closures, retail bankruptcies are set to come back into play in a big way in 2023 after a relatively slow year in 2022. Between the start of 2023 through the end of February, six major retailers filed for bankruptcy, according to BDO’s bi-annual bankruptcy report. That’s more than the total number of retail bankruptcies in 2022.

In some cases, these bankruptcies could correlate with store closures for chains as well.","['Shoshy Ciment', 'More Stories Shoshy', 'View All']",2023-04-11 19:30:32+00:00

Bruce Springsteen played the new Long Island venue UBS Arena for the first time last night. The latest stop of Springsteen and the E Street Band’s 2023 International Tour saw The Boss dust off “Mary’s Place” for its tour debut, likely in response to a sign held by an audience member near the stage.

Located in Elmont, New York, UBS Arena opened in October of 2021 and is the home to the National Hockey League team the New York Islanders. Springsteen and the E Street Band made their debut at UBS Arena on Sunday and return for a second engagement at the venue on Tuesday before concluding the first leg of the massive excursion in Newark, New Jersey this Friday, April 14.

“Mary’s Place” was originally released by The Boss on his exceptional 2002 album The Rising and was played by Springsteen nearly 200 times through February 21, 2017. The song made its triumphant return in the 10-slot last night, a space usually reserved for tour debuts.

Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band treated fans to a spot-on rendition of The Rising standout at UBS Arena. The Boss was in fine form urging the audience to singalong, while the band nailed the breakdowns and modulation.

See the first “Mary’s Place” in over six years via fan-shot video below:

The Boss and his band delivered a 27-song concert last night at UBS Arena. Sunday’s setlist was typical for the tour with the exceptions of the “Mary’s Place” bust out, the third “Bobby Jean” of the five-week old excursion and fifth rendition of “Pay Me My Money Down.” The Boss led his band on four songs from 2020’s Letter To You and filled the evening’s encore with plenty of classics.

Largely symbolic then this vote. But I suppose there's less political significance here. Yes, exactly. So the idea is the government guarantees for the deal have already been signed off by a group of senior politicians, senior members of parliament, the so-called financial delegation. They have a signed off on the dollar cut and dry. The debate we're seeing in parliament is largely a symbolic one because quite quite frankly, parliament can't decide on anything anymore. But still, what we have heard in parliament is that lawmakers were very, very unsatisfied with what happened here. They said banks must be able to go bankrupt. Those banks need to be punished. And this is what we will we see it is a show of force that is actually not going to change anything. Most of all, it will not prevent the deal from going ahead. Boston, good morning. Are there any other hurdles to the merger going forward from here that may need to be aware of? I'm not really so I mean, obviously, it's not closed yet, so there can still things happening, but competition concerns which are obviously on the table because we emerging the two biggest banks of the country into just one now.

(Alessandro della Valle/Keystone via AP)

GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland’s lower house of parliament issued a searing — though symbolic — rebuke Wednesday of an emergency plan spearheaded by the executive branch to prop up embattled Credit Suisse and shepherd it into a takeover by Swiss banking rival UBS .

The National Council, through an unusual left-right alliance, voted twice over the last day to reject government guarantees authorized last month of 100 billion Swiss francs (about $110 billion) to help keep Credit Suisse afloat and 9 billion francs to help UBS mop up any losses it may incur in the deal.

The votes took place in a special parliamentary session that wrapped up Wednesday to scrutinize long-running troubles at Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old bank that was a pillar of Swiss finance, and the government plan to save it from a collapse that could have shaken the global financial system.

Switzerland’s main right-wing party opposed tighter regulations on banks, while centrists favored tougher rules but would accept state help for banks in some cases. Left-leaning parties that have long decried “overly dangerous” banks were insistent on stricter limits on bonuses for top executives and requirements for more money to be kept on hand by the biggest lenders.

“The whole discussion centered on whether more regulation was needed — in particular to the leverage ratio — and severely regulate bonuses of the managers of the big, systemically important banks,” Socialist lawmaker Roger Nordmann said.

Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter, who has been at the epicenter of a political firestorm around the 3 billion franc ($3.25 billion) Credit Suisse-UBS deal , told lawmakers that capital requirements would be increased — and “you can start from the premise that big banks will face more severe restrictions.”

But Nordmann, who had questioned the minister on that issue, said by phone that Keller-Sutter hadn’t presented any clear measures and was too noncommittal.

“That’s an invitation for all dishonest bankers to come to Switzerland, and what we need is honest people,” he said.

The votes were symbolic because a parliamentary commission has already signed on to the emergency rescue plan that Swiss authorities orchestrated last month as shares of Credit Suisse sank and customers rushed to pull out their money. The failure of two U.S. banks just days before had sparked concerns about the stability of the Swiss lender and the global financial system.

Both the Swiss central bank and the government splashed out more than 200 billion Swiss francs in guarantees to help underpin the fusion of the country’s top two banks and keep Credit Suisse from failing.

Parliament’s upper house had voted Tuesday to accept the takeover plan announced March 19 by Switzerland’s seven-member executive branch — known as the Federal Council, which is headed by the Swiss president — as well as the Swiss National Bank and the financial markets regulator, FINMA.

Lawmakers in the upper house backed a plan that would have included limits to bonuses for bankers, but it didn’t go far enough for the lower house.

For now, stricter legislative rules on Switzerland’s biggest banks — led by UBS — are in limbo ahead of crucial elections for parliament this fall.",['Jamey Keaten'],2023-04-12 11:14:03+00:00

https://apnews.com/article/ubs-credit-suisse-sergio-ermotti-ralph-hamers-fe7a93d9f61632c58fa6bf954a658227,UBS brings back Ermotti as CEO with Credit Suisse deal ahead,"GENEVA (AP) — UBS said Wednesday that it’s bringing back former CEO Sergio Ermotti to lead the Swiss bank as it executes a government-orchestrated plan to take over struggling rival Credit Suisse .

Ermotti, who was the bank’s top executive for nine years and led a turnaround following the 2008 global financial crisis, will take over next Wednesday from CEO Ralph Hamers.

Hamers took up the job in November 2020 and will remain at UBS during a transition period “to ensure a successful closure of the transaction and a smooth handover,” the bank said in a statement.

“Whilst Ralph was capable of doing the job, we felt that Sergio was better suited to navigating these things,” Chairman Colm Kelleher said on a conference call, alluding to the UBS board decision. “I cannot reemphasize how big this deal is in terms of financial history and financial engineering that’s required.”

UBS credited Ermotti, who is now chairman of insurer Swiss Re, for having “cut its footprint” and changing the culture of the bank — and it pointed to his experience in bringing big financial institutions together.

ADVERTISEMENT

Ermotti, who hails from the southern, mostly Italian-speaking Swiss region of Ticino, acknowledged that “coming back to manage this situation is a challenge” but felt “a sense of call-of-duty aspect” to return.

Plus, he said he had contemplated a tie-up like the one with Credit Suisse while previously in the top job, and it would be a bit of a ”contradiction” for him not to accept the post “to basically execute on what I believe was the right next move for UBS.”

Kelleher said he called Ermotti “to explore the possibility of this” a day after the emergency takeover deal was settled on March 19, which involved Swiss regulators, the federal government and top executives at both banks.

“This is is the biggest single financial transaction since 2008. That brings significant execution risk,” Kelleher said.

The hastily arranged, $3.25 billion deal for Credit Suisse aimed to stem the upheaval in the global financial system after the collapse of two U.S. banks and jitters about long-running troubles at Credit Suisse led shares of Switzerland’s second-largest bank to tank and customers to pull out their money.

ADVERTISEMENT

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after the central bank’s plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and customers. The Swiss executive branch passed emergency measures to bypass shareholder approval.

Uncertainties still lie ahead, including a U.S. Senate committee report released Wednesday that says Credit Suisse violated a plea agreement with U.S. authorities by failing to report secret offshore accounts that wealthy Americans used to avoid paying taxes.

UBS said it assessed outstanding lawsuits and investigations as part of the Credit Suisse acquisition and expects the deal to be beneficial for shareholders. It says it’s working to close the sale and get approval from regulators in the coming weeks or months.

ADVERTISEMENT

Hamers, the outgoing CEO, said UBS executives want to ensure “a digestible transaction” in terms of risk. He said there were plans to “manage down the investment bank” at Credit Suisse because many of the activities were not central for UBS.

UBS leaders announced no immediate plan about job cuts linked to the deal.

Swiss lawmakers and academics have raised concerns that the deal could create an unwieldy Swiss banking behemoth, while UBS executives said regulatory issues loom internationally before the deal can close .

Ermotti suggested he didn’t view “too big too fail” concerns as a problem.

“I do think that scale and size is not a problem if it is focused and well-managed,” he said. “For me, the debate nowadays is not ‘too big to fail’ but ‘too small to survive’ — and we want to be a winner.”

Many Credit Suisse customers have expressed regret at the looming disappearance of a 167-year-old bank that has been a pillar of Switzerland’s renowned banking and financial industry.

(Ennio Leanza/Keystone via AP)

LONDON (AP) — Credit Suisse shares plunged Monday after Swiss authorities cut a deal with its bigger rival UBS to acquire the troubled bank at a marked-down price. But European bank stocks and the wider market gained as investors watch whether moves to shore up banks will stem further upheaval in the global financial system .

Shares of Credit Suisse , whose woes stem from questions over its internal controls, closed nearly 56% lower a day after UBS said it would buy its fellow Swiss bank for a lowball price of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion). The shares traded at about the level they are valued at in the deal.

Swiss regulators orchestrated the purchase in a bid to stop more turmoil after the collapse of two U.S. banks . In an indication of the frantic, behind-the-scenes deal-making to resolve the issue before markets opened, the acquisition was announced late Sunday.

There is still uncertainty over how the deal will play out for the combined lender and what comes next for the wider banking system. Analysts say some previous forced bank mergers didn’t work out well for shareholders in the long run.

It could be that no more banks get into trouble, but it’s also possible that “we just go from one weak institution falling over to the next,” said Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser at Capital Economics.

There no other obvious candidates that could be singled out like Credit Suisse, but it’s “hard to predict where the problems will emerge,” she said.

ADVERTISEMENT

UBS shares initially dropped on the Swiss stock exchange but closed up 1.3%. The deal whipsawed other European bank stocks , which tumbled before some clawed back their losses. Germany’s Deutsche Bank, France’s BNP Paribas and Italy’s UniCredit ended higher, while London-based Barclays sank 2.3%.

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after a central bank plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) last week failed to reassure investors and customers.

Many of Credit Suisse’s problems were unique and unlike the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S., including high interest rates. Those U.S. failures have raised questions about other potentially weak global financial institutions, sweeping up the already beleaguered Swiss bank.

Credit Suisse has faced an array of troubles in recent years, including bad bets on hedge funds , repeated shakeups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

Analysts and financial leaders say safeguards are stronger since the 2008 global financial crisis and that banks worldwide have plenty of available cash and support from central banks. But concerns about risks to the deal, losses for some investors and Credit Suisse’s falling market value could renew fears about the health of banks .

ADVERTISEMENT

Tobias Straumann, an economic history professor at University of Zurich, said the merger was the right move because the U.S. bank collapses and the danger to Credit Suisse was “an international banking crisis in the making.”

“Markets are very nervous, and I think an additional accident in Switzerland would have fueled a lot of problems,” he said.

Credit Suisse is among 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities were worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

UBS is bigger but Credit Suisse wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. It has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich through its wealth management business, and is a major mergers and acquisitions adviser. However, Credit Suisse weathered the 2008 financial crisis without assistance, unlike UBS.

ADVERTISEMENT

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in higher-risk Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out, leaving investors with hefty losses. Lawyers were already circling, eyeing possible legal action to get compensation for bondholders amid concern about the market for those bonds and other banks that hold them.

The combination of the two Swiss banks, each with histories dating to the mid-19th century, strikes at the country’s reputation as a global financial center — putting it on the cusp of having a single big national bank that would be too big to fail.

Some customers were caught off guard by the turmoil, at odds with Switzerland’s reputation as as stable banking haven.

Sahil Dua, an Indian software engineer living in Zurich, holds a UBS account but opened one at Credit Suisse last Tuesday, the same day the lender flagged “material weaknesses” in internal financial controls that ultimately helped spark its downward spiral.

“My impression as a customer,” Dua said, is “that at least these two banks were going to be fine, whatever happens.”

Dua said he wanted the credit card that came with the Credit Suisse account and that he considered switching over his primary bank account and bringing his savings from UBS. Not anymore.

ADVERTISEMENT

He has a Credit Suisse account “with a balance of zero, and I’m glad that it’s still zero because I didn’t add any money yet to it.” In the future, he plans to spread out his money in more than one bank.

“I will look into diversification more seriously now,” Dua said.

As the market tries to figure out what comes next after the merger, Straumann, the professor, said he wouldn’t be surprised to see problems for regional banks in Europe after further interest rate increases , much like what happened with midsized banks in U.S.

“The banking system of Europe has not fully recovered from the crisis” in 2008, he said. “It’s better, of course, than it used to be, but it’s vulnerable.”

As many as 11,000 employees will be laid off in Switzerland, and another 25,000 worldwide, the Swiss newspaper said, citing an unidentified senior manager at UBS. The two lenders together employed almost 125,000 people at the end of 2022 — about 30% of them in the home country. A spokesperson for UBS declined to comment on the report.

In a separate development, Switzerland’s Office of the Attorney General said Sunday it had opened a probe into the takeover and was working to identify possible crimes. The top federal prosecutor ordered national and regional authorities to investigate, according to a statement.

Years of scandals at Credit Suisse culminated in massive deposit outflows which would have seen it collapse the following Monday had action not been taken, according to Switzerland’s finance minister. The emergency takeover of Credit Suisse by its larger competitor in a $3.3 billion deal was announced by the Swiss government on March 19 after five days of talks brokered by officials.

The number of predicted layoffs described by the newspaper dwarfs the 9,000 that Credit Suisse announced before its rescue by UBS. The final total was expected to reach a multiple of that number given the rivals’ sizable overlap.

Publicly, UBS has said it will give clarity on job cuts as soon as it can. While it was clear that major layoffs were coming, the lender sees retention of talent as a significant part of the takeover’s execution risk.

Firms such as Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are gearing up to recruit some of the investment bankers and wealth managers likely to be let go. Already, headhunters saw themselves swarmed by Credit Suisse bankers seeking new jobs, as people from more than a dozen firms told Bloomberg last month.

Limited Impact

The government resorted to emergency law to push through the deal without having to seek shareholder approval. So while the annual general meetings of the two lenders — coming up this week — are expected to host many angry investors, shareholder impact will be limited.

Important shareholder Norges Bank Investment Management, the sovereign wealth fund of Norway, has announced it will vote against the reelection of several Credit Suisse directors, including chair Axel Lehmann.

Separately, the Financial Times reported on Saturday that UBS has a short list of four management consultants to advise on integrating Credit Suisse. The bank is soon to decide between Bain & Company, the Boston Consulting Group Inc., McKinsey & Co Inc and Oliver Wyman Inc, the newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the process who weren’t identified.

It’s expected to be one of the most lucrative contracts in years for dispensing financial services advice due to the complex, years-long process needed to meld the banks, according to the report.

UBS, Bain, BCG, McKinsey and Oliver Wyman didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment outside of ordinary office hours.

GENEVA, April 2 (Reuters) - The bank created by the UBS (UBSG.S) takeover of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) is poised to reduce its workforce by 20-30%, Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger reported on Sunday, citing an unnamed senior UBS manager.

UBS agreed to buy Zurich rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion) in a deal engineered by the Swiss government, the central bank and market regulator to avoid a meltdown in the country's financial system.

But the deal, which was also designed to help to secure financial stability globally, has raised concerns over the size of a new bank with $1.6 trillion in assets and more than 120,000 staff worldwide.

The report said the bank could cut about 11,000 jobs in Switzerland.

Jobs in its U.S. investment banking arm will also be affected, the report said, with UBS set for talks to terminate a deal that would have given Wall Street dealmaker Michael Klein control of much of Credit Suisse's investment bank.

It's going to remain tricky for investors to pick stocks for the rest of this year because markets are still hooked on unpredictable economic data, according to UBS.

The Swiss bank's CIO Mark Haefele expects the choppiness stocks seen in the early months of 2023 to continue, thanks to traders' fixation on the rate of inflation and unemployment.

""So far, 2023 has been a much better year for asset class returns, with the S&P 500 up 7.5% year-to-date, but has been characterized by ever-changing market narratives,"" Haefele wrote in a note Wednesday.

The investment chief was referring to the benchmark US stock index's rebound this year from a plunge of 18% in 2022.

""The potential remains for this data-dependent market to keep jumping from one narrative to another for the rest of the year,"" he added. ""This should make it difficult for investors to navigate the coming months.""

The note comes ahead of the release later Wednesday of the monthly Consumer Price Index report, which will show how much US inflation rose in March. His bank believes the CPI will come in at 5.1% — down from 6% in February, but still far off the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

Markets will stay unpredictable even if inflation cools for a ninth month in a row, according to Haefele, because investors are still struggling to make sense of the US labor market.

Friday's nonfarm payrolls report showed the US economy added 236,000 jobs in March, its lowest print since December 2020. Investors are divided on whether that's good or bad news.

""While the optimistic interpretation of this data is that the tightness in the labor market is easing as the balance of supply and demand of labor improves, the pessimists view it as the first cracks that could be followed by much greater deterioration in the coming months,"" Haefele said.

Worries about an economic slowdown could soon replace inflation tracking as a key focus, UBS's investment chief added.

Economists have warned that the Fed's year of aggressive interest-rate hikes will likely soon start weighing on growth – and that slowdown could drag on stocks by chipping away at listed companies' earnings.

""As inflation eases, growth may take over as the more dominant concern, perceived or otherwise,"" Haefele said.

""The optics of a decline in headline CPI to 3% may reinforce the view that growth, rather than inflation, will be driving Fed decisions and the market's performance,"" he added.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/29/business/ubs-new-ceo-sergio-ermotti-intl-hnk/index.html,Sergio Ermotti: UBS brings back ex-CEO to oversee Credit Suisse rescue,"Hong Kong/London CNN —

UBS is bringing back its former chief executive, Sergio Ermotti, to manage the hugely complex and risky task of completing the bank’s emergency takeover of rival Credit Suisse (CS).

The surprise appointment, announced Wednesday, highlights the scale of the challenge facing the Swiss lender as it executes a first-of-its-kind merger of two global banks with combined assets of nearly $1.7 trillion.

The Swiss government engineered the rescue 10 days ago as Credit Suisse teetered on the brink of collapse, a failure that would have rocked a global financial system already reeling from the second-biggest American banking collapse in history.

Ermotti was UBS (UBS) CEO between 2011 and 2020 and is credited with successfully overhauling the bank following its bailout during the 2008 financial crisis. He is seen as a safe pair of hands capable of integrating Credit Suisse and salvaging core parts of its business.

His second stint in the top job, which begins April 5, means the end of current CEO Ralph Hamers’ tenure after just two and a half years in the role, during which time the bank has delivered successive record results.

Hamers “has agreed to step down to serve the interests of the new combination, the Swiss financial sector and the country,” UBS said in a statement. Hamers will remain at the lender for a transition period.

UBS chairman Colm Kelleher thanked Hamers for his contribution but said the board felt Ermotti was “the better horse” for such a massive integration. “There’s a huge amount of risk in integrating these businesses,” Kelleher said at a press conference.

As a first order of business, Ermotti will need to cut thousands of jobs and downsize Credit Suisse’s investment bank, while aligning it with a more conservative risk culture — a task he is familiar with.

During his previous tenure as CEO, Ermotti “transformed” UBS’ investment bank “by cutting its footprint and achieved a profound culture change within the bank which allowed it to regain the trust of clients and other stakeholders, while restoring people’s pride in working for UBS,” the lender said in its statement.

Kelleher and Hamers both highlighted the cultural differences with Credit Suisse. UBS’ smaller rival has been plagued by scandals and compliance failures in recent years that wiped out its profit and cost several top managers their jobs.

In a fresh blow to Credit Suisse’s reputation, a US Senate investigation published Wednesday found that the bank is complicit in ongoing tax evasion by ultra-wealthy Americans.

“We do not want to import a bad culture into UBS,” Kelleher told reporters, adding that UBS would put all Credit Suisse employees “through a culture filter, to make sure we don’t import something into our ecosystem that causes culture issues.”

‘Call of duty’

Hamers said integrating the banks is something he would have “loved to do,” but that he supported the board’s decision, which was in the best interests of the new entity and its stakeholders — including Switzerland and its financial sector.

The merger is high-stakes for Switzerland’s economy, too. The combined bank’s assets are worth twice as much as the country’s annual output, while local deposits in the new entity equal 45% of GDP — an enormous amount even for a nation with healthy public finances and low levels of debt.

In the Wednesday statement, Kelleher said the deal “imposes new priorities on us,” while supporting UBS’ existing strategy.

He added: “With his unique experience, I am very confident that Sergio [Ermotti] will deliver the successful integration that is so essential for both banks’ clients, employees and investors, and for Switzerland.”

Ermotti told reporters he felt a “call of duty” to accept the role and that during his previous stint as CEO he had believed that an acquisition of this kind was the “right next move for UBS.”

“I always felt that the next chapter I wanted to write back then was a chapter of doing a transaction like this one.”

Ermotti is currently chairman of Swiss Re (SSREF) and intends to step down after the insurer’s annual general meeting next month.","['Michelle Toh Hanna Ziady', 'Michelle Toh', 'Hanna Ziady']",2023-03-29 00:00:00

BRUSSELS, April 4 (Reuters) - UBS (UBSG.S) has secured a temporary green light from EU antitrust regulators to complete its acquisition of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) but will still have to request clearance under EU merger rules, the European Commission said on Tuesday.

UBS came to Credit Suisse's rescue last month with a merger engineered and bankrolled by the Swiss authorities.

According to European Union merger rules, companies can only complete deals after securing EU antitrust approval or face fines as much as 10% of their aggregate turnover.

The EU antitrust enforcer said the Swiss banks had asked for an exemption from this standstill obligation.

""Upon request of UBS and Credit Suisse, the Commission has granted a derogation from the standstill obligation on the basis of Article 7(3) of the EU Merger Regulation,"" the Commission said in an email to Reuters.

""The Commission found that the requirements for a derogation were met and therefore it approved on 4 April 2023 the derogation request subject to conditions.""

The banks have yet to formally put in a request for EU approval of their deal. Such an application would kick off a 25-working day preliminary review of the transaction.

https://www.finews.com/news/english-news/56801-the-hidden-treasures-of-credit-suisse,The Hidden Treasures of Credit Suisse,"The federal government and supervisory authorities have forced UBS to take over Credit Suisse. In doing so it saddled UBS with several potential pitfalls. But hidden treasures also await the buyer.

It was hard to believe UBS chairman Colm Kelleher when he said on March 19 the takeover of Credit Suisse offered «tremendous opportunities.» The extraordinary session of the Swiss parliament over the past few days added fuel to doubts over the transaction. No fewer than ten proposals were adopted with twice as many motions further submitted, marking the start of significantly stricter regulation of the largest Swiss bank.

Huge Risks?

If the legal risks that UBS is assuming from Credit Suisse are added to the unknowns and costs of a four-year integration, observers have to conclude UBS has taken on considerable risk with the merger. Some clarity on the issue may be forthcoming soon. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (Finma) wants to wrap up enforcement proceedings on the Archegos debacle.

There is another view of the deal, at least on paper. UBS and its top management around Kelleher and new CEO Sergio Ermotti have surprising treasures waiting for them from their acquisition.

This is suggested by an analysis JP Morgan recently completed on UBS. The American bank is acting as an investment banking advisor to UBS in the takeover. These are the most surprising projections:

1. A New Julius Baer Every Three Years

According to the analysis, the acquisition of Credit Suisse will create a wealth management juggernaut. Once the integration is completed in 2027, two-thirds of the combined entities' pre-tax profit, estimated at seven billion dollars, would come from wealth management. In the business with wealthy private clients, the combined group would be in a position to collect $150 billion in new money every year. Such a haul of new money would create an equivalent to a new Bank Julius Baer every three years measured by client assets, the analysts write. These figures would make many a private bank CEO in Switzerland giddy.

2. Costs Can be Squeezed More Easily than Expected

The team around lead analyst Kian Abouhossein calculates that UBS's savings target of eight billion dollars by 2027 is not a very challenging one. Credit Suisse's investment bank alone generates annual costs of seven billion dollars, and UBS wants to wind down that business. The costs of job cuts are also likely to be limited. Voluntary staff turnover at UBS was 13 percent last year and slightly higher for Credit Suisse at 15 percent.

The combined bank is expected to incur legal risk costs of around five billion dollars by 2027. Overall, analysts expect net restructuring costs of $8.2 billion, so UBS could manage quite a precision landing between savings and expenses.

3. Swiss business is worth billions.

According to the calculations, Credit Suisse's Swiss business is expected to contribute about a third of the combined bank's pre-tax profits from 2027. However, UBS may decide to share this revenue with the public for several reasons. With an initial public offering of Credit Suisse Switzerland, UBS will reap at least ten billion dollars, according to JP Morgan. Such a scenario played out in 2015 when then-CEO Tidjane Thiam planned to take the unit that is now the Swiss Bank public in a partial IPO on Switzerland's SIX stock exchange.

4. Guardrail Against Setbacks

By acquiring Credit Suisse for three billion francs, when it was worth around 7.4 billion on the stock exchange, UBS created a cushion worth billions against setbacks from the start. Add to that extensive guarantees from the federal government and supervisory authorities worth at least 25 billion francs. This is due to the mandatory convertible bonds of Credit Suisse of 15.8 billion francs triggered by Finma, and direct government guarantees of at least nine billion francs.

Thanks to the writedown of mandatory AT1 convertibles, UBS will save interest costs incurred by Credit Suisse, a savings analysts estimate at one billion dollars per year.

5. Enormous Reservoir of Deferred Claims

Deferred tax assets arising in the US business are a highly complex factor, but UBS has repeatedly drawn from this resource in the past and used it to boost its net profit. In the future, the bank could continue to capitalize on such assets to smooth out any setbacks from the merger. With the sale of Credit Suisse's US business units, such a capitalization might even become necessary, JP Morgan analysts believe.

According to their calculations, Credit Suisse had no less than $60 billion in net tax loss carryforwards at the end of last year, but the bank's management hardly used any of it. At UBS, the tax loss carryforwards at the same time amounted to 32 billion dollars.",[],2023-04-14 05:00:01

https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ubs-credit-suisse-drop-after-swiss-prosecutor-probes-takeover-deal-2023-04-03/,UBS and Credit Suisse shares drop as Swiss prosecutor investigates takeover,"













LONDON, April 3 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and UBS (UBSG.S) shares fell on Monday after Switzerland's federal prosecutor opened an investigation into the emergency merger of the two lenders.

The office of the attorney general said on Sunday that the prosecutor opened an investigation into the state-backed takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS Group last month, looking into potential breaches of the country's criminal law by government officials, regulators and executives at the two banks.

UBS and Credit Suisse were each set for their biggest daily decline in 10 days, falling around 4% in early trading before paring losses to stay down 2% and 1.8%, respectively at 1410 GMT. They underperformed the European banking index (.SX7P), which was up 1.2% on the day.

The banks declined to comment on the investigation.

The UBS takeover of rival Credit Suisse was engineered by Swiss authorities in a bid to rein in turmoil in global banking.

But the Swiss public and politicians have voiced concerns about the level of state support offered in the deal, with nearly 260 billion Swiss francs in liquidity and guarantees offered by the government and Swiss National Bank (SNB).

""The government underestimated how much antipathy the public in Switzerland have against the deal,"" said Michael Field, Europe Market Strategist at Morningstar.

""Comments in the media this morning about 30% of workforce being cut don’t help either,"" he added.

Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger reported on Sunday, citing an unnamed senior UBS manager that the bank created by takeover of Credit Suisse is poised to reduce its workforce by 20-30%. The two banks combined have 120,000 staff worldwide and $1.6 trillion in assets.

Separately, data showed on Monday that sight deposits held by the SNB declined last week, suggesting that Credit Suisse and UBS may have cut back on use of emergency funds offered them.

The SNB, Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment on the changes in sight deposits.

Banking giant UBS is buying its smaller rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion, in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in global banking.

GENEVA (AP) — Banking giant UBS is buying troubled rival Credit Suisse for almost $3.25 billion, in a deal orchestrated by regulators in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in the global banking system.

Swiss authorities pushed for UBS to take over its smaller rival after a plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) failed to reassure investors and the bank’s customers. Shares of Credit Suisse and other banks plunged this week after the failure of two banks in the U.S. sparked concerns about other potentially shaky institutions in the global financial system.

Credit Suisse is among the 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

The deal was “one of great breadth for the stability of international finance,” said Swiss President Alain Berset as he announced it Sunday night. “An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Switzerland’s executive branch, a seven-member governing body that includes Berset, passed an emergency ordinance allowing the merger to go through without shareholder approval.

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann called the sale “a clear turning point.”

“It is a historic, sad and very challenging day for Credit Suisse, for Switzerland and for the global financial markets,” Lehmann said, adding that the focus is now on the future and in particular on the 50,000 Credit Suisse employees, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland.

Following news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated financial moves to stabilize banks in the coming week. This includes daily access to a lending facility for banks looking to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice which widely used during the 2008 financial crisis. Three months after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September of 2008, such swap lines had been tapped for $580 billion. Added swap lines were also rolled out during market turmoil in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in March of 2020.

“Today is one of the most significant days in European banking since 2008, with far-reaching repercussions for the industry,” said Max Georgiou, an analyst at Third Bridge. “These events could alter the course of not only European banking but also the wealth management industry more generally.”

Colm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed the “enormous opportunities” that emerge from the takeover, and highlighted his bank’s “conservative risk culture” — a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse’s reputation for more swashbuckling, aggressive gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said the council “regrets that the bank, which was once a model institution in Switzerland and part of our strong location, was able to get into this situation at all.”

The combination of the two biggest and best-known Swiss banks, each with storied histories dating to the mid-19th century, amounts to a thunderclap for Switzerland’s reputation as a global financial center — leaving it on the cusp of having a single national champion in banking.

The deal follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further panic. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse’s share price began plummeting this week.

ADVERTISEMENT

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde lauded the “swift action” by Swiss officials, saying they were “instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.”

She said the banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.

UBS officials said they plan to sell off parts of Credit Suisse or reduce the bank’s size in the coming months and years.

The Swiss government is providing more than 100 billion francs in aid and financial backstops to make the deal go through.

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out. European bank regulators use a special type of bond designed to provide a capital cushion to banks in times of distress. But these bonds are designed to be wiped out if a bank’s capital falls below a certain level, which was triggered as part of this government-brokered deal.

Berset said the Federal Council had already been discussing a long-troubled situation at Credit Suisse since the beginning of the year and held urgent meetings in the last four days amid spiraling concerns about its financial health that caused major swoons in its stock price and raised the specter of the 2007-08 financial crisis.

Investors and banking industry analysts were still digesting the deal, but at least one analyst was sour on the news because it could damage Switzerland’s global banking image.

“A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,” said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas LLC, in an email.

Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

The Credit Suisse parent bank is not part of European Union supervision, but it has entities in several European countries that are. Lagarde reiterated what she said last week after the central bank raised interest rates — that the European banking sector is resilient, with strong financial reserves and plenty of ready cash.

Many of Credit Suisse’s problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve . As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.

The deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn’t invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.

On Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.

Its current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.

While smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management.

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon UBS brings back Sergio Ermotti as CEO

The statement pointed to how Ermotti ""successfully repositioned"" the bank following the 2008 global financial crisis, and ""achieved a profound culture change within the bank."" That allowed the Swiss lender to ""regain the trust of clients and other stakeholders, while restoring people's pride in working for UBS,"" the bank said. Hamers told employees of the government-orchestrated takeover that UBS ""did not buy Credit Suisse only to close it,"" Reuters reported. In the announcement, UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher called Hamers an ""outstanding"" CEO who led UBS to ""unprecedented success despite a challenging environment."" While the acquisition of Credit Suisse supports UBS' existing strategy, it imposes new priorities on the group, he said. ""With his unique experience, I am very confident that Sergio will deliver the successful integration that is so essential for both banks' clients, employees and investors, and for Switzerland,"" Kelleher said.

'Part of the fallout'

The move surprised some market observers, but one analyst said it was just part of the fallout from the merger deal. As with ""all forced mergers or an acquisition of not equal parties, you can always have this friction and I think that's what you see at play here,"" Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, told CNBC on Wednesday. ""It was very clear that the now former CEO at UBS was not really happy about this shotgun wedding and I think that's the fallout you see now.""

watch now

Notably, in an interview with Swiss newspaper NZZ am Sonntag in September, Ermotti argued that there was no ""compelling"" economic reason for Switzerland to have two big banks. ""Everything we have seen, I think, since the global financial crisis with regulation is leading us down one path, of bigger and bigger and banks, more and more concentration, which leads to fragility but also less competition and I'm not sure it's long term going to be good for the overall financial system,"" Garnry argued. ""It puts the conversation out there: are we moving towards more public interference with money itself?"" He said the discussions in the U.S. after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is, ""to what degree should there be guarantees on deposits above the FDIC deposit guarantee limit? If you do that, what is the purpose of having banks, private money etc?"" ""I think there are big questions here about this and where we're heading in the banking system,"" Garnry said.

In a press briefing following the announcement, Kelleher stressed that Ermotti's Swiss nationality is a ""nice thing,"" but not a main driver behind the appointment decision. He stressed the ""significant execution risk"" of implementing UBS' takeover of Credit Suisse, noting the new CEO's expertise best equips him as the ""best pilot"" to navigate the challenge. He signaled the Swiss government were advised of Ermotti's designation. ""Clearly regulators have a right of saying no. So we have to make sure that there is approval and Sergio is approved for this role,"" he said. Ermotti expressed interest to remain in the position long term, saying that the tasks ahead align with his vision for UBS. ""There is a sense in me, and I felt, a sense of call of duty aspect. And also, frankly speaking, I always thought that despite all these discussions around the size of the bank, I always felt that the next chapter I wanted to write back then was a chapter of doing a transaction like this one,"" he said.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-suisse-pays-back-emergency-101613470.html,"Credit Suisse pays back some emergency liquidity, central bank data suggests","ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse has already paid back some of the emergency liquidity offered by the Swiss National Bank (SNB), data suggested on Tuesday, signaling an ebbing of the liquidity crisis which triggered the lender's fall.

Sight deposits - cash held by commercial banks overnight with the SNB - fell by 31 billion Swiss francs ($34.3 billion)last week, data published by the central bank showed.

The drop was the second-biggest weekly decline on record, second only to when the SNB started mopping up market liquidity after it quit negative interest rates last September.

In recent weeks sight deposits have soared as Credit Suisse received emergency liquidity infusions to head off a bank run as nervous customers pulled out their cash.

The lender last month said it intended to borrow up to 50 billion francs from the SNB in a last-ditch attempt to save itself after confidence evaporated following a string of blunders.

Following a state-sponsored takeover by rival UBS, another 200 billion francs in liquidity was also made available by the SNB.

As a result sight deposits rose from 515 billion in mid March to peak at 567 billion francs as the SNB deposited the cash with Credit Suisse, an upward trend which reversed last week as sight deposits fell to 532 billion francs.

Credit Suisse, the SNB and UBS declined to comment on the development.

Karsten Junius, an economist at J.Safra Sarasin, said the decline could be attributed to Credit Suisse paying back some of the emergency liquidity it took and no longer needing to draw on the central bank support.

""Confidence in the bank has been restored by the UBS merger, and from this data it would appear customer outflows have stopped,"" Junius said.

""A bank run has been stopped by the SNB coming in and offering massive liquidity and customers are reassured by UBS being there too. Credit lines from other banks would also appear to have been re-established.""

The SNB may also have been active in forex markets, selling some of its foreign currencies to prop up the franc, an activity which would have seen sight deposits decline as the SNB received francs from commercial banks in return.

Story continues

But this was likely to be minor, Junius said, saying the SNB only sold foreign currencies worth 27 billion in the last three months of 2022.

""It's extremely unlikely the SNB sold more than 30 billion of forex just last week,"" Junius said. ""Confidence has been restored – the rescue seems to have done the trick. It seems to have been a successful operation.""

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) shares are roughly 2% in pre-market Tuesday after UBS analyst Karl Keirstead issued a warning that Street expectations for cloud growth remain too high for the first quarter.

Amazon, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are expected to report on their Q1 performance later this month.

“Our checks down-ticked relative to our last round 3 months ago and in our view, Street growth estimates for 2023 are still too high,” Keirstead said in a client note.

For Amazon particularly, the Street estimates remain way too high. The Street expects AWS growth of 15% in Q1, down from the 20% reported for the fourth quarter. Keirstead projects that AWS likely grew 13% in Q1.

“This implies the growth rate of industry leader AWS will have gone from 40% in 4Q21 to 13% in 1Q23 in just 5 quarters. We find this a surprising turn of events that far exceeds the pressure we’re witnessing across most other technology sub-sectors. In our view, this is clear evidence of a significant pandemic-fueled cloud demand boost and resulting wasteful spend that is now being eliminated by enterprises and their consulting partners.”

Moreover, the analyst warns that “most investors believe that these estimates are too high and that AWS revs growth could hit 8-10% in 2Q23.” For Q2, UBS sees AWS growing at 10%.

“The current sell-side analyst consensus estimate is for AWS revenue growth to level out at ~14% in 4Q23 from 15% in 1Q23, presumably on the basis of easier comparisons and/or a 2H23 demand improvement. In our view, most (at least tech/software) investors have little/no confidence in these estimates and are modeling AWS revs growth to dip to 8-10% in 2Q23 and to be ~10% in 4Q23,” the analyst added.

Overall, the analyst concludes by saying that the cloud growth is “much worse” than expected and “is unchartered territory for most investors.”

For the January to March 2023 quarter, banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) segment accounted for about 31.4 percent of TCS revenue. Of the total order book value of $10 billion, the segment had a total contract value (TCV) of $3 billion in Q4.

“Our approach is to stay agile,” TCS management told CNBC-TV18 in an exclusive interaction and added that uncertainty is still lingering and likely to be there for some time. Customers are prioritising some spends over others.

Speaking of specifics, they said manufacturing and auto sectors have seen discretionary projects being put on hold. BFSI is also seeing caution where clients want to spend wisely, outgoing CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said.

""We are not seeing any deal cancellations. Budgets are largely intact and clients want to spend wisely and be cautious for a few weeks,” he added.

K Krithivasan, who takes over as CEO on June 1, said that some discretionary work may be deferred or cancelled by Credit Suisse as merger with UBS progresses.

“Customers are likely to prioritise certain kinds of projects over others – defer and not cancel. Our thesis is technology spend is quite resilient and customers need that to remain competitive in the marketplace. So, they cannot say that I will not do these kinds of projects; they have to do those projects, they may defer.”

He explained that projects with long return on assets (ROA) timelines are the ones that typically get held. ""Would you call cloud a discretionary project or a non-discretionary? We keep signing cloud deals and cloud deals keep going on. So, each bank and each institution’s situation vary. It depends on where they think there is an immediate opportunity,” he said.

TCS management's remarks come a day after India's largest IT services exporter reported a five percent sequential increase in March quarter net profit to Rs 11,392 crore while the firm flagged worries from its key market of North America.

Events like the fall of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and fears of a contagion have impacted client sentiments in North America and the banking, financial services and insurance sector in particular, leading to clients deferring spends, the Tata Group company said.

The company reported revenue growth of 0.6 percent in constant currency terms, which was the slowest since the April-June period of financial year 2021, which is the quarter in which the pandemic hit. Gopinathan conceded that the growth in the topline over the December quarter has been ""weaker than anticipated"" because of the setbacks in North America.

He said the ""negative"" sentiment has led to a situation where discretionary spends are being put on hold by clients, and added that it is ""wait and watch"" in the immediate near-term for them. There have been no project cancellations and the structural story of Indian IT is intact, he added.

Brokerage firm JPMorgan cited the earnings miss to unexpected weakness in the US, particularly in BFSI, and continued challenges in Europe.

https://www.socialeurope.eu/the-failure-of-credit-suisse-not-just-a-one-off,The failure of Credit Suisse—not just a one-off,"The bank was mismanaged but its collapse, Peter Bofinger writes, reveals a system of regulation with as many holes as a Swiss cheese.

With UBS having absorbed a discounted Credit Suisse, Swiss regulators have an even bigger bank to supervise (Peace-loving/shutterstock.com)

In the wake of the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse (CS), the narrative that the two banks were special cases—so one could therefore return to business as usual—quickly gained ground. On closer inspection, however, this is far from being valid, at least for CS.

True, the bank has a long history of mismanagement: involvement with the Bulgarian mafia from 2004 to 2007, dubious dealings involving a British subsidiary in Mozambique in 2011 and losses at the hedge funds Archegos and Greensill in 2021. And it is probably not wrong to report a ‘general rip-off mentality’ among its managers.

Recent problems should not however be reduced to past mistakes—or excessive management remuneration. The bank was not operating in a vacuum: it was under the constant supervision and monitoring of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB). In the event of chronic concerns, it was up to these institutions to urge remedial action.

‘Well placed to cope’

Yet in its financial-stability report last September, referring also to UBS, the SNB declared:

The capital position of both banks has improved further since the last Financial Stability Report. The capital ratios of Credit Suisse and UBS exceed the requirements under the Swiss ‘too big to fail’ (TBTF) regulations and are above average by international comparison.

The report also presented very positively the outcomes of stress test conducted by the SNB: ‘The results of the stress scenario analysis indicate that, thanks to their capital buffers, the two globally active Swiss banks are well placed to cope with severely adverse developments in economic and financial conditions.’

And despite all the mismanagement, the CS annual report published last month showed the bank still had 45 billion Swiss francs in equity at the end of 2022. Its auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, confirmed in that report that everything was in order. Since CS was sold to UBS shortly afterwards for only CHF3 billion, the question arises as to how such a massive loss in value—in less than three months—might be explained.

Real causes

What were the real causes of the bank’s collapse? There is no doubt it was triggered by massive withdrawals by depositors who feared losing their money in the face of so much negative news. But this was also addressed by the SNB in its stability report. In the event of ‘liquidity shocks’, it said it would provide additional liquidity, in its capacity as ‘lender of last resort’, against sufficient collateral.

This corresponds to the textbook procedure for a banking crisis, based on distinguishing solvency and liquidity problems. A bank that is insolvent, being over-indebted, must be closed or restructured immediately. A solvent bank, on the other hand, which becomes illiquid due to a withdrawal of deposits triggered by psychological factors, presents a scenario for the central bank to step in as lender of last resort. As long as the bank is sufficiently capitalised, the central bank should be able to keep it alive with liquidity assistance.

If the accounts are correct, CS was a solvent bank with above-average capital adequacy, at least until the end of 2022. As late as March 15th 2023, the SNB and FINMA explicitly affirmed that CS met the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks. If necessary, the SNB would provide liquidity.

The fundamental problem, therefore, is that the Swiss authorities were not able to rescue CS, despite their statements to the contrary, resulting in a huge loss of capital for shareholders and subordinated debt holders. For Switzerland, this raises the question of how to reform its authorities, which were incapable of recognising the bank’s problems and ensuring its survival, so that they may adequately supervise the new, extra-large UBS and effectively stabilise it in the event of a run.

No all-clear

Beyond Switzerland, the collapse of CS shows that even an above-average capital base is no guarantee of a bank’s stability in a crisis—and that stress tests, however important, should not be overestimated. If the Swiss authorities were unable to deal with a serious liquidity problem, moreover, couldn’t something similar happen in other countries?

So there is still no reason to sound the all-clear on global financial markets. The abrupt rise in central-bank policy rates since last year is a major challenge for the banking system. During the years of low interest rates, many institutions were generous in granting long-term loans, especially for housing, which are now yielding low returns. At the same time, they have been refinancing themselves with very short-term deposits.

As long as depositors remain calm, this is not a problem. But if confidence in a bank wanes, the only way for it to attract new funds is to pay the currently very high short-term interest rates for them. A liquidity problem can then quickly become a solvency issue.

This creates a conflict of objectives for central banks. Still unchecked ‘core’ inflation (excluding energy and food) argues for maintenance of a restrictive monetary policy but this increases tensions in the financial system.

This trade-off cannot be resolved but central banks can mitigate it by working with governments to make clear that solvent institutions can count on full liquidity support. In particular, the scope of government deposit insurance could be increased, at least temporarily, to reduce the risk of destabilising withdrawals in the first place.

Fundamental question

Given the complexity of global financial institutions, the more fundamental question arises as to how outsiders entrusting their money to a bank should be able to judge its quality and so impose what the literature calls ‘market discipline’. The World Bank defines this thus: ‘Market discipline refers to the process by which market participants, such as depositors and shareholders, monitor banks’ risks and take action to limit excessive risk-taking.’

Customers can certainly monitor their pizza bakers but when it comes to banks depositors are no more able to monitor the safety of the service than are the passengers of an airline. The design of institutional arrangements that provide absolutely safe assets for large depositors is therefore an open question.

The option of holding deposits directly with the central bank—a central-bank digital currency—would be very welcome. But so far, the European Central Bank’s plans for a digital euro envisage an upper limit of only €3,000, to avoid the bypassing (‘disintermediation’) of the banking system.

Global sales increased just 3% to an estimated $67.8bn—largely thanks to a handful of dealers at the top end making more multi-million-dollar sales. However, some segments—notably the auction market—contracted slightly last year.

By the end of 2022 particularly, the market appeared “overstimulated and began to cool, with reports of more subdued bidding and buying at events”, writes Clare McAndrew, the author of the report and founder of the consultancy Arts Economics. She paints a divergent picture of an increasingly top-heavy market, with the US and UK posting positive results but China’s performance marred by tight zero-covid policies. Overall, growth was “more muted […] than anticipated”, McAndrew says.

Nonetheless, the market’s rebound has exceeded its decline. Sales in 2022 were greater than before the pandemic and represent the second-highest point achieved in the market to date, with values coming in just below the peak of 2014.

The US held its top spot in the global ranks, with its share of sales increasing by 2% year-on-year to 45%. Driven by a major uplift at the high end of the auction sector, values increased 8% to $30.2 bn, the highest level in the US to date. China (including Mainland China and Hong Kong) had a significantly worse year in 2022. Here sales declined by 14% to $11.2bn, their lowest level since 2009. As a result, China’s share decreased (by 3%) to 17%, pushing it back into third position.

China’s loss was the UK’s gain. Back in second place with an 18% share of sales (up 1% on last year), the UK maintained its momentum, with a 5% rise in value to $11.9bn. McAndrew says she had been “braced” for poorer results with Brexit still a thorn in the side of the UK trade—the value of the market in the UK has fallen by 7% between 2013 and 2022—but while European trade has been damaged, the report found that the UK was the most international of markets, with 60% of dealer sales made to overseas buyers­.

Auction sales fall

On the face of it, 2022 appeared to be a bumper year for auction houses, with the first sale to surpass $1bn. There was plenty more marketing hype when the auction houses posted their end of year results, which in Sotheby’s case included real estate and classic car auctions, somewhat skewing the picture.

But all was not as it seemed. According to the report, auction sales in fact fell last year, dropping 2% to $30.6bn across both public and private sales (though this was up 11% on 2019’s pre-pandemic figure). This was largely due to a poor performing Chinese auction market, which saw cancellations in Shanghai in spring and further lockdowns stalling important autumn sales on the Mainland, contributing to a 22% drop in 2022. Overall, global auction sales accounted for 45% of the market in 2022, down 2%.

The air is thin at the top of the market, but enough oxygen is circulating to keep the big-ticket items turning over. In the auction sector, the high-end performed most strongly in 2022, with works priced at more than $10m being the only segment to increase in value (by 12%). As is common in times of economic instability, wealthy buyers tend to pivot to the most established artists and works they perceive to be lower risk.

The US regained its leading position in 2022 with 37% of sales. The majority of the highest-priced works of art were sold in New York during the year, including 41 of the top 50 fine art lots. China fell back to second place (26%, down by 7%) and the UK was the third-largest auction market with a stable share of 13%, just ahead of France at 9%.

While online sales at Christie’s, Sotheby’s and Phillips accounted for 7% of total public auction sales—down by 4% year-on-year—the importance of digital technology in supporting sales has continued to expand. Sotheby’s reports that 91% of bids placed at their auctions in 2022 were online (from just 44% in 2017 and only 18% in 2012). Similarly, at Christie’s, 75% of bids were online, compared with 45% in 2018.

The report also highlights some potential problems ahead for the auction sector, which may have already contributed to its falling share in global sales. For example, financial tools such as guarantees are becoming more convoluted; last May, New York City abolished rules introduced 30 years ago to regulate the auction industry, which experts think could muddy the water.

As one anonymous dealer says in the report: “We have seen a resurgence of investment schemes and the use of inappropriate financial tools in the art market again in the last two years. When these things start to proliferate, it’s always a sign of trouble ahead.”

Polarisation among dealers

The dealer sector grew by 7% to $37.2bn in 2022, though growth and profitability were generally only observed at the very top end. Those with the highest turnovers of more than $10m saw some of the largest increases in average sales values, at 19%. According to dealers operating in this segment, buying has been “strong but thin at the top”. They note that many of their wealthiest buyers had expressed a preference to buy privately in order to engage in a more “thought-through transaction” and retain the ability to negotiate with more opacity.

As one dealer puts it: “We have found the top end alive and well and there seems to be a better appetite to buy privately this year. While this used to be about privacy, now we find collectors at this level want to avoid being manipulated by guarantees and having third parties to a transaction and prefer the more straightforward approach of a private sale.”

Some of the uplift in sales in 2022 was due to an increased volume of transactions. The median number of works sold over the year rose from 65 to 75. The largest dealers, with turnovers of more than $10m, sold a median of 225 works during 2022, versus 15 for those with turnovers of below $250,000.

The smallest businesses struggled with more cautious buyers, rocketing exhibiting costs and stagnating sales, leading to bigger discounts. Those with turnovers of less than $250,000 reported a decline of 3% in sales. Dealers in this segment noted that, unlike buyers at the top end who are perhaps more impervious to general economic conditions, their buyers had tighter budgets and were generally more cost-conscious in 2022.

The growing costs of the art business also put a significant dent in dealers’ profits. The report notes that shipping in particular has shot up, with some dealers putting this at 40% of expenditure, up from 20% in 2021.

Art fairs have also become a bone of contention, with some dealers noting that in 2022 they spent a minimum of between 15% and 20% more than in pre-pandemic times on art fairs and their related costs. As one puts it: “Post-pandemic, the costs of participating in art fairs has skyrocketed and it is becoming no longer economically viable for us to exhibit as they don’t bring in enough business to justify the high cost of a booth.”

Another says the art fair model is being tested “partly through the pandemic-induced changes of habit and buying preferences, but also due to challenges surrounding transport and travel and the general rise in costs”.

As for wider trends, there appears to be a shift in power towards artists who are working more directly with collectors, in no small part driven by advances in technology and a greater focus on social media. When primary market dealers were asked about their level of concern regarding artists bypassing their galleries, 35% said they were “extremely or moderately” concerned and only 20% were not concerned. Almost 40% of primary market dealers predicted an increase in direct selling by artists in the next year.

As a result, McAndrew notes, some dealers are “feeling pressure on their programmes both from the top down from large top-tier galleries and the risks of artists being poached, and the bottom up from the artists themselves as their practices mature”.

Wet painting market dries out

One of the biggest trends over the past couple of years has been the mushrooming market for ultra-contemporary or ""red-chip"" artists. In large part driven by a frenzied auction market, this trend now appears to be in reverse. In 2021, contemporary art (created by artists born after 1945) and works made in the past 20 years both doubled in value at auction, largely thanks to strong sales of ultra-contemporary artists. However, in 2022, the older segment of post-war art was more successful, with values up by 3%, versus declines of 26% for contemporary art and 17% for works created in the past 20 years.

When surveyed, some dealers commented that they felt certain parts of the primary market had become “overinflated” in 2021, and sales had not kept up at the same pace in 2022, with concerns that there could be a “rocky road ahead for some artists”. Comments were particularly directed at so-called “living celebrity artists” whose prices are already at the $1m-plus level relatively early in their careers.

Some dealers noted how “auction visibility was replacing museum acquisitions as a marketing technique for artists” with works going from artists’ studios to auction in a very rapid turnaround, while others blamed an influx of “too many new galleries that have no integrity or knowledge of the business”, who are pushing up prices.

Gender parity—when will it come?

Despite continued lip service to gender equity, the representation of female artists remains persistently lower than their male counterparts. Price parity has also been slow to evolve. According to the report, the share of female artists represented by galleries was 39%, up from 37% in 2021. In the primary market alone, progress appears to have stalled in the past two years, with the share of female artists now at 42%, marginally down on the 44% achieved in 2019.",[],2023-04-04 00:00:00

The Swiss National Council and the Council of States are debating the emergency rescue of Credit Suisse in a special session starting today and running through Thursday. A hot topic is the domination of the Swiss banking industry by a single major bank that could develop concentrated market power in certain industry segments.

The FDP wants to ensure the new megabank is reduced in size, with SVP National Councilor and banker Thomas Matter singing from the same song sheet. There should no longer be a single Swiss bank whose bankruptcy is so systemically important that it has to be rescued by the state or taxpayers.

Waiting for the Weko

The demands of the centrist party are somewhat less stringent. According to its parliamentary group leader Philipp Matthias Bregy, it does not want to stop the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS. First, however, there must be a financial strategy and questions of competition law must be clarified by the Competition Commission (Weko).

Then UBS would be free to decide whether to submit to the stricter regulation for big banks or to downsize.

Rising Clamor

Amid all the clamor, it seems to be forgotten the parliament cannot thwart the merger of UBS and Credit Suisse.

Before the takeover is finally approved, the hands of the politicians are tied. The authorities, for their part, have already approved the merger under emergency law, which can only be applied for six months.

Political Tug-of-War

It is entirely up to UBS whether it integrates Credit Suisse completely, spins off part of it, targets an IPO, or takes any other decision regarding the future of the defunct Credit Suisse.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-holders-ubs-bonds-issued-091751514.html,Most Holders of UBS Bonds Issued Just Weeks Ago are Keeping Them,"(Bloomberg) -- Most investors who bought UBS Group AG bonds issued days before its arranged takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG have chosen to hold on to the notes, in what is seen as a vote of confidence in the lender.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The Swiss bank had launched a buyback of two euro-denominated notes, offering investors an opportunity to get out of the debt issued on March 9 — just before it agreed to take over its troubled rival in a deal that triggered market chaos and a spike in both lenders’ credit risk.

Holders of about €454 million ($498 million) of 2028 maturity notes and €273 million of 2032 notes opted to tender them, leaving about €1.046 billion and €977 million of the securities outstanding respectively, according to a regulatory filing this morning. The notes were issued by UBS Group AG, the holding company that will subsume the Credit Suisse assets.

The result was a show of support in UBS, said Oliver Sinnott, a fund manager at IQ EQ Fund Management Ireland Ltd. “If investors thought there was a problem and could not sell the bonds in the market they would have used this as a liquidity event and got out,” he said. Sinnott added that he owns some UBS bonds but not the ones subject to the buyback.

The bonds were bought back at the price they were originally issued at, yet both were quoted higher in Wednesday trading. That meant that the price being offered by UBS in the tender was out of date, according to Sinnott.

Both UBS and Credit Suisse credit default swaps, a key pain point at the height of the panic over the banking system, have eased back down to pre-merger levels, according to CMAI pricing. UBS’s shares were also back trading around pre-takeover levels a couple of sessions after the deal was announced.

With the impeccable timing of one of the country's famed watches, Swiss officials brokered a last-minute emergency takeover of the troubled bank Credit Suisse by fellow banking giant UBS.

In a press conference on Sunday, Swiss president Alain Berset said the recent banking industry turmoil had destabilized Credit Suisse and that this deal was vital to stabilizing the bank and the global banking sector.

Under the deal, UBS Group AG will buy Credit Suisse for more than $3 billion in an all stock deal. UBS will also get an extra $100 billion from the Swiss central bank as part of the deal.

Swiss Assist

The marriage between UBS and struggling rival Credit Suisse marks the latest eruption in the ongoing banking troubles sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

Panicked investors and jittery depositors pulled billions out of the long-troubled Credit Suisse in recent days, leading to worries the bank could become insolvent if emergency measures were not taken. The Swiss central bank threw a $54 billion life to Credit Suisse, but it wasn't enough to stabilize the institution.

It's yet another stunning event in more than a week of turmoil and alarm in the banking sector, especially worrisome because Credit Suisse is what's known as a ""global systemically important bank."" That essentially means if Credit Suisse fails, it could have ripple effects throughout the global economy.

A History of Trouble

The Credit Suisse crisis boiled over last week, when the bank announced ""material weaknesses"" in its financial reporting.

But the bank's troubles started long before that, with a series of financial and political scandals that hit the bank's reputation and bottom line. In the last two years alone, the bank's stock has fallen by more than 80%.

Credit Suisse was created 166 years ago to help finance Switzerland's rail network. It became an international name in the banking sector and one of the most significant banks in the world

More supportive macro conditions and healthy financial institutions are expected to keep the damage from recent instability in the banking system contained within Asia, according to UBS.

«The banking turmoil will likely crimp financial conditions—first in the developed world, before seeping into Asia. Tighter credit could keep consumers cautious and slow the region’s post-COVID growth restart from a 1Q trough,» said a report by UBS Global Wealth Management’s chief investment office.

«The good news is that monetary policy is already on pause, or nearing it across most Asian economies, which should soften the blow.»

AT1 Bonds

Market scrutiny of AT1 bonds following Credit Suisse’s $17 billion write-off will persist, especially relative to non-financial peers issuing such debt. Nonetheless, UBS advises investors to hold on to existing positions issued by top-quality banks.

«This is particularly true for Asia’s national champions, many of which tend to be partially owned by governments and remain fundamentally sound,» the report explained. «We remain engaged in the space, but caution against adding exposure to the asset class for now. Investors can instead focus on opportunities in higher-quality senior bank bonds.»

Q2 Outlook

In broader markets, UBS underlines that «Asia’s fortunes hinge on how China’s revival compares to the depth of the US slump and EU slowdown». It also forecasts a higher probability that central banks will end their hiking cycles «sooner rather than later».

«In fact, markets are already pricing in a Fed policy pivot from July. But investors with cash or expiring fixed deposits should not wait for a final rate hike—which we expect in May—before locking in current yields,» the bank said.

From a current retail store base of 940,000 locations, at least 50,000 doors are estimated to close over the next five years, based on new data from UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser. That estimate presumes retail sales growth of 4 percent annually and e-commerce penetration up from 20 percent to 26 percent by Fiscal Year 2027. But a protracted recession where retail sales grow just 3 to 3.5 percent annually would place downward pressure on closures, raising the forecast to 70,000 to 90,000 locations.

The last time the tally for store closures shot up was in 2020, following the Covid outbreak when more than 11,000 fashion-related doors shuttered after many banners ended up in bankruptcy.

Post-Covid, the costs of doing business for retailers has gone up, mostly due to higher hourly wages, the largest component in running a store. And with retail rents per square foot also up 1.8 percent, the overall costs keep climbing, increasing the “hurdle rate to keep stores open.” This comes with an inflationary backdrop that is far from kind for retail in general.

Lasser and the UBS retail team, including softlines analyst Jay Sole, on Tuesday disclosed in a report that the pace of store consolidation is “set to accelerate” due to a slowdown in consumer spending, a reduction in the availability of credit and a rise in the penetration of e-commerce. That would mean a minimum of 5 percent fewer stores in the U.S., excluding gas and food service, by the end of 2027 and presuming there is no prolonged recession.

Who will benefit? Large, well-capitalized retailers such as Walmart, Target and Costco, or specialty chains with a unique point of differentiation, such as Academy Sports and Outdoors. Another that could take market share from weaker competitors exiting the market is Dick’s Sporting Goods. The analysts estimate that average sales per store is $5.7 million, putting $285 billion of retail sales “up for grabs,” presuming 50,000 doors close. If 26 percent of sales move online, that would leave $210 billion in sales, or $1,600 in annual spend per household, that could shift to retailers such as Walmart, Target or Costco. All three also have robust online channels, as well as enhanced digital fulfillment capabilities.

Not surprisingly, retailers most at risk for closure are smaller chains, and doors operated by independents due to their limited access to the capital needed to develop a robust omnichannel offering. UBS proprietary data indicated that smaller chains shed 40,000 stores in the past 10 years, while retailers with over 500 employees added 17,000 doors. The data points also show that store closures accelerated five quarters after banks began to pull back on credit. Currently, banks are reporting a 20 to 30 percent decline in willingness to make consumer installment loans, the UBS report said. The analysts see this as a leading indicator of store closures going forward. Households with less capital to spend on goods also mean fewer entrepreneurs will have the wherewithal to create new retail businesses.

By subsector, a minimum of 14,000 apparel and accessories stores—12 percent of the current base of 119,062 doors—could close, and that’s on top of the 10,612 doors that have shuttered since the first quarter of 2018. Going back to the fourth quarter of 2007, the apparel store base has declined 17 percent.

In addition, 4,000 home furnishings locations, or 9 percent of the current base of 47,769 could close, on top of the 2,142 closures since the first quarter of 2018. The count for home furnishings is high because furniture and bedding are discretionary categories that have a high percentage of sales that are financed, the UBS analysts concluded.

Most at risk are retailers with a large number of stores in shopping malls. And within softlines, store closures at department stores and specialty retailers are expected to surpass the recent trend in store openings. That would mean brands that have a strong direct-to-consumer focus such as Nike and Levi Strauss should do well. Also cited was American Eagle Outfitters, considered a strong omnichannel retailer.

“We remain bearish on Nordstrom, Kohl’s, Macy’s and Dillard’s,” the analysts concluded. Regional chains, mostly with locations in shopping malls, are expected to “continue closing stores and potentially go out of business,” the report said. Meanwhile, department stores are expected to continue to lose customers to off-price retailers.",['Vicki M. Young'],2023-04-11 20:42:19+00:00
https://www.ubs.com/us/en/wealth-management/insights/market-news/article.1588248.html,Where are the opportunities in fixed income?,"With recent events suggesting that policy rates may peak earlier than anticipated, CIO thinks investors should act to lock in attractive yields in fixed income. (UBS)

Yields, though off their peak, still look attractive, and we see the potential for capital gains in the event of a deeper economic slowdown. As a result, we think it's time to increase exposure to bonds and investors holding excess cash should consider opportunities to lock in today's yields.

Yields have fallen from their peak, amid worries that problems in the banking sector will slow growth.

The yield on the 2-year US Treasury is down from a peak of 5.06%in early March, to 3.77% as of 27 March.

The yield on the 10-year US Treasury has fallen from a 2023 high of 4.07% in early March to 3.37%.

The yield on the 10-year German Bund is also down, from 2.75% in early March to 2.12% at present.

But despite the recent fall in yields, we have become more positive on bonds.

The recent concerns over the banking sector have increased the changes that central bank hiking cycles will end sooner.

In its latest statement the Fed replace language about “ongoing increases” likely being appropriate with a milder comment that “some additional policy firming may be appropriate.” The ECB said it would be “data dependent.”

Even after recent declines, we think yields remain attractive, especially given the potential for capital gains in the event of a deeper economic slowdown.

So we are most preferred on bonds, with a preference for high quality.

We think it's time to increase exposure to bonds. High grade and investment grade bonds still provide some protection against recession risks, despite the recent moderation in yields.

We are also most preferred on emerging market bonds, as investors position for the inflection point in global growth in 2023.

Did you know?

As of 27 March, markets are pricing a peak in US interest rates of around 4.86% by May, versus the current target range of 4.75–5%.

Month-over-month, US core CPI inflation, excluding food and energy, rose at the fastest pace in five months, accelerating to 0.5% in February from 0.4% in January. Year-over-year, headline inflation moderated to 6% from 6.4%—and down from a June peak of 9.1%—but the core measure only eased to 5.5% from 5.6%.

Core Eurozone inflation for February rose to 5.6%, above the 5.3% forecast and the fastest rate since the formation of the single currency in 1999.

Investment view

With recent events suggesting that policy rates may peak earlier than anticipated, we think investors should act to lock in attractive yields in fixed income. High grade and investment grade bonds still look attractive as defensive assets. We also like sustainable and emerging market bonds.

5 Things We Learned from Art Basel and UBS’s Report “The Art Market 2023”

“The Art Market 2023” report paints a “mixed picture” of the art market in 2022. The seventh annual report released by Art Basel and UBS, authored by cultural economist Dr. Clare McAndrew, gathers data from a range of sources, including dealers, auction houses, collectors, art fairs, and databases. Here, we share five key takeaways.



1. Growth in the art market is primarily at the top According to McAndrew, the global art market grew by 3% as a whole in 2022, to an estimated $67.8 billion, exceeding its pre-pandemic level of $64.4 billion in 2019. However, the report describes 2022 overall as a “year of divergence,” with much of the art being sold worldwide concentrated to the most expensive end of the market. At auction houses, the only segment to show an aggregate increase in sales year over year was works that sold for more than $10 million. Christie’s, Sotheby’s, and Phillips each posted record-high revenues last year, which, when combined, totaled $17.7 billion. Overall, however, sales of fine art, decorative art, and antiques at public auction houses declined by 1% in 2022 to $26.8 billion. Some 30% of mid-tier auction houses (those below the top 10 auction houses) experienced a decline in sales last year, and 40% reported being less profitable than in 2021. It was a similar picture for art dealers, too: “Those at the higher end performed significantly better than their peers in the lower tiers,” McAndrew reported. For dealers, sales in the $10 million–plus segment grew by 19%, while the sub-$250,000 segment declined by 3%. Some 24% of dealers overall reported a decline in sales, while 58% reported that sales have improved since 2019.

2. The U.K. art market retains momentum, while China takes a slide The U.S. remains the largest art market by some distance, recording an 8% growth in sales year over year to reach its highest-ever total of $30.2 billion. The growth in sales resulted in the U.S.’s market share climbing an additional 2%, pushing it to 45% of the global art market. Next is the U.K., which returned to second place after growing from 17% of market share last year to 18% this year. In third place is China, which now accounts for 17% of the global art market, a 3% decline from the year prior. Despite Brexit worries and worse-than-expected economic performance, the U.K. art market’s return to second place comes after posting its lowest-ever share of the global market in 2021. But the picture is not all rosy for the U.K. The share of sales by value in the U.K. market has fallen by 7% between 2013 and 2022 (compared to a 46% rise for the U.S.). And while sales rose by 5% year over year to $11.9 billion, they still sit below pre-pandemic levels—$12.7 billion in 2019. Still, the increase in market share for the U.K. art market is welcome news. The U.K.’s change in position also has much to do with China. Last year was one to forget for the Chinese art market, which saw sales decline by 14% year over year. Lockdown policies stalled activity in some regions, the report notes, and some major sales were canceled or cut short due to COVID-19 measures, such as in November when Shanghai fairs Art021 and West Bund Art & Design ended early. The three countries at the top of the pyramid look unlikely to change. Taken together, the U.S., U.K., and China make up some 80% of the art market globally. France is in a distant fourth place with an 8% slice of the global market, 9% below China.



3. NFT sales declined dramatically, but the bottom hasn’t fallen out just yet Sales in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) reached close to $2.9 billion in 2021, reflecting the feverish enthusiasm for a new, unexplored aspect of the market. Last year, however, the report finds that sales dropped by almost 50%, tumbling to $1.5 billion. It’s a significant fall, but hardly the apocalyptic crash that many predicted during the coldest months of last year’s “NFT winter.” Sales of NFTs in 2022 were still 70 times their level in 2020, and the number of unique crypto wallets operating on NFT platforms rose by 26%, from 177,157 in 2021 to 222,470 in 2022. As NFT-backed digital art receives growing institutional recognition and artists continue to work within the medium, it made up 5% of dealer sales in 2022, compared to 1% in 2021. Secondary market activity for NFTs also continues to grow: Unique sellers rose year over year by 55% to 180,416 in 2022, and buyers by 14% to 174,764. Meanwhile, the number of participants buying and selling in the primary market fell by 12%.

4. A mixed scorecard for art fairs Last year saw art fairs return fully from the COVID-19 pandemic, with galleries surveyed in the report exhibiting at the same number of fairs on average as they did in 2019. There were 346 live events last year, an increase of a third compared to 2021, but still 62 fairs less than in 2019. Sales from live events increased by 27% from 2021 and accounted for 35% of gallery sales overall (second to in-gallery sales at 47%). While this is a significant gain from last year, this share is 7% lower than in 2019. Galleries turning over more than $10 million annually made 40% of their sales at fairs, compared with 27% for businesses with a turnover of between $250,00 and $500,000. A continuing theme of the report is a factor not unique to the art world: rising costs. Art fairs are at the sharp end of this issue. Some dealers noted that they were spending a minimum of between 15% and 20% more on fairs and their related costs when compared to pre-pandemic times. Just over half (51%) of dealers said that they predicted sales at art fairs would increase (compared to 65% who responded affirmatively in 2021), and 13% expected a decline. Unsurprisingly, dealers with turnovers of $10 million or more are planning to take part in more fairs in 2023 than any other segment, and they also have the most positive outlook, with 88% predicting that their sales from art fairs would rise in 2023.

5. The general outlook is not positive—but it’s not overtly negative, either Dealers and auction houses are not looking positively at 2023, but they’re not predicting disaster. Less than half of the dealers (45%) surveyed for the report said that they expected an improvement in sales for 2023. Only in China and South America did a majority of dealers say that they expected an increase in sales for 2023. And interestingly, the dealers with less than $250,000 in turnover struck the most positive tone: Some 52% of the segment said that they expected an increase in sales for 2023. The most negative was the $250,000–$500,000 segment, where only 37% said the same. Like dealers, less than half (48%) of mid-tier auction house employees expected an improvement in sales, but more worryingly, some 24% predicted a drop in their sales compared to 2022. The good news is that a strong majority (77%) of high-net-worth collectors remain positive about the year ahead, and more than half (55%) plan on buying art in 2023. That figure rises to 65% when focused on collectors in the U.S. “While signals of macro-economic volatility are a dominant talking point as we head into 2023, the data shows us a resilient art market bolstered by deep-pocketed collectors, particularly at the high end,” said Noah Horowitz, CEO of Art Basel, in the foreword to the report.",['Arun Kakar'],2023-04-04 20:28:12+00:00
https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubs-set-talks-with-michael-klein-terminate-credit-suisse-investment-bank-deal-ft-2023-03-21/,UBS set for talks with Michael Klein to terminate Credit Suisse investment bank deal - FT,"













March 21 (Reuters) - UBS (UBSG.S) is set to enter talks with Michael Klein to terminate a deal that would have seen the Wall Street dealmaker take control of much of Credit Suisse's (CSGN.S) investment bank, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.

UBS on Sunday agreed to buy rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.23 billion) in stock and agreed to assume up to 5 billion francs ($5.4 billion) in losses, in a shotgun merger engineered by Swiss authorities to avoid more market-shaking turmoil in global banking.

Klein, a veteran dealmaker, was merging his eponymous advisory boutique into Credit Suisse's investment banking operations to create CS First Boston as a standalone business which he would have led from New York.

UBS has now assigned a legal team to examine how to void the contract Credit Suisse signed with Klein in the cheapest way possible, according to the FT report, which cited people with direct knowledge of the matter.

""We assume he (Klein) is cherry picking. The deal was done when the selling bank had a gun held to its head and we are no longer in that position,"" a person close to UBS said, according to the report.

UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment, while Klein could not be immediately reached for comment.

By Joice Alves

LONDON (Reuters) - Credit Suisse and UBS shares fell on Monday after Switzerland's federal prosecutor opened an investigation into the emergency merger of the two lenders.

The office of the attorney general said on Sunday that the prosecutor opened an investigation into the state-backed takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS Group last month, looking into potential breaches of the country's criminal law by government officials, regulators and executives at the two banks.

UBS and Credit Suisse were each set for their biggest daily decline in 10 days, falling around 4% in early trading before paring losses to stay down 2% and 1.8%, respectively at 1410 GMT. They underperformed the European banking index, which was up 1.2% on the day.

The banks declined to comment on the investigation.

The UBS takeover of rival Credit Suisse was engineered by Swiss authorities in a bid to rein in turmoil in global banking.

But the Swiss public and politicians have voiced concerns about the level of state support offered in the deal, with nearly 260 billion Swiss francs in liquidity and guarantees offered by the government and Swiss National Bank (SNB).

""The government underestimated how much antipathy the public in Switzerland have against the deal,"" said Michael Field, Europe Market Strategist at Morningstar.

""Comments in the media this morning about 30% of workforce being cut don’t help either,"" he added.

Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger reported on Sunday, citing an unnamed senior UBS manager that the bank created by takeover of Credit Suisse is poised to reduce its workforce by 20-30%. The two banks combined have 120,000 staff worldwide and $1.6 trillion in assets.

Separately, data showed on Monday that sight deposits held by the SNB declined last week, suggesting that Credit Suisse and UBS may have cut back on use of emergency funds offered them.

The SNB, Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment on the changes in sight deposits.

The timing was brutally swift, but UBS Group AG’s decision to replace its chief executive shouldn’t be a great shock. Ralph Hamers, a retail and commercial banker who liked to spend big on digital development and talk in the jargon of consultants, already faced doubts that he was the right leader for UBS before it landed the biggest bank takeover in more than a decade.

Sergio Ermotti, the former master returning to the top job, has important qualities lacked by Hamers and critical to shepherding the emergency takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG: First, the experience of radically restructuring UBS’s own investment bank after the global financial crisis; second, the statesman-like presence needed to keep national authorities and the bank’s staff onside while also trying to win over a skeptical Swiss public.

This takeover was unpopular. There is taxpayer money at risk in government guarantees that UBS required to do the deal; and it creates a dominant lender domestically and a globally systemic bank whose balance sheet is more than twice the size of the Swiss economy. Credit Suisse was railroaded into this rescue. The reputations and careers of the politicians and regulators who led it depend on a successful outcome.

Hamers doesn’t have the heft for the role. Since his surprise appointment in 2020, there were doubts he had the experience to run an investment bank, which is a tricky task of managing large financial risks and outsized egos – both of which can suddenly turn volatile. Taking over the people and trading positions of UBS’s great local rival adds to the complexities and pitfalls.

Hamers was focused on operational efficiency and developing the bank’s digital offerings to seduce new and existing clients. He agreed to a $1.4 billion deal for a small US digital wealth business, WealthFront, focused on younger people who were not yet super rich. That was ditched in short order once Colm Kelleher arrived as chairman last year: It was no longer judged the best use of shareholder money or management time. Kelleher also told Hamers to tone down the geek-speak of agile ecosystems and holistic curation.

Now UBS has to cope with fixing Credit Suisse. It needs sharp minds, quick decisions and a coherent strategy — things that its failed rival lacked for years. UBS will cut risk from Credit Suisse’s investment bank and trading desks, while cherry-picking its best bankers. Headhunters and rivals are already trying to lure away many of the same people. Several have leapt.

Ermotti talks the language of top investment bankers after a career that took him through Merrill Lynch in Zurich, London and New York, on to UniCredit SpA and then to run UBS from 2011 to 2020. He helped to lead the radical post-crisis closure of most of UBS’s bond-trading desks and dealt with the fallout of the rogue trader scandal that cost the bank $2.3 billion.

Kelleher is worried about infecting UBS with the bad culture from parts of Credit Suisse’s investment bank and control functions, he told journalists on Wednesday. That makes sense after scandals such as the Mozambique tuna-boat bond sales and the $5 billion-plus losses it suffered in the collapse of Archegos Capital Management. Ermotti has a chance of keeping the Credit Suisse people he wants and ensuring they fall in line with a new way of doing things.

It helps too that Ermotti is Swiss. The Irish Kelleher said replacing the Dutch CEO was a global solution not a Swiss one, but Ermotti himself joked he got the job because he’s from Lugano. He restores an unwritten rule that at least one of the two top roles at UBS be held by a local.

Swissness may be more important than normal given all that is at stake. To support the takeover, the government promised to share in the costs of ditching unwanted assets: UBS will eat the first 5 billion francs ($5.5 billion) of losses and then the government is on the hook for up to 9 billion francs of subsequent hits. The government also indemnified the Swiss National Bank against losses on a special emergency 100 billion-franc liquidity facility created to stabilize Credit Suisse during the takeover.

The Swiss finance minister, Karin Keller-Sutter, and the president of the financial regulator, Marlene Amstad, both launched publicity drives last weekend to justify their actions. Opinion polls showed public concern about their handling of the deal and its effect on competition. Four in five Swiss think that UBS should spin off Credit Suisse’s domestic bank.

Ermotti’s challenges are myriad: slash the investment bank swiftly without taxpayers footing a large bill; instill confidence in Swiss leaders that their own actions won’t come back to bite them; convince the country that a dominant domestic bank won’t exploit its pricing power and shirk on its customer care; win back private clients who have taken their deposits and run, many of whom might have suffered big losses on owning Credit Suisse’s wiped out CoCo bonds or its shares. And of course, keep all of UBS’s existing staff and shareholders happy that their own investments of time and money are still good.

Ermotti isn’t guaranteed to pull this off, but he has a much better chance than Hamers.

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/05/ubs-bosses-job-cuts-executive-pay-shareholders-bank-takeover-credit-suisse,UBS bosses urged to avoid job cuts and hikes in their pay after Credit Suisse deal,"Worried UBS investors have urged the Swiss lender to avoid sweeping job cuts and inflating executive pay as they raised concerns about the creation of a mega-bank after the emergency takeover of smaller rival Credit Suisse.

Addressing more than 1,100 shareholders at the St Jakobshalle arena in Münchenstein, near Basel, UBS bosses said they understood why investors may be “bewildered or even angry” after the surprise deal last month, following weeks of panic about the health of the banking sector.

“It was a historic day and a day we hoped would not happen,” the chair of UBS, Colm Kelleher, said. “Yet it is a significant milestone, not only for UBS and Credit Suisse but also for Switzerland, for the global financial industry.”

While bosses acknowledged the government-brokered deal – which was executed with only 48 hours of due diligence - came with risks, they defended the takeover and said it presented a business opportunity for UBS. However, bosses said all options were on the table such as a future split or spinoff of Credit Suisse assets.

Some shareholders acknowledged the potential benefits of the takeover but said they were “concerned about this new giant bank”, which will be the fourth largest in the world, with a combined $5tn (£4tn) in invested assets, including the possibility of unjustified pay hikes and job cuts.

“This will in no way justify any inflation of remuneration,” one shareholder said, urging bosses to be prudent even as they prepared to manage a much larger bank. “The current plans are already extremely generous,” the shareholder added.

“We need to learn the lessons from the Credit Suisse disaster,” another investor said. “We need to radically change the culture of bonuses – [which are] the wrong incentives – otherwise, we’ll be waking up one day with UBS having gone down the drain.”

Investors also raised the alarm about thousands of potential job cuts as bosses try to get rid of duplicate roles.

“Those synergies you were referring to would potentially cost more than 30,000 jobs worldwide,” a shareholder said, referring to recent press reports. “These social consequences, also in Switzerland, could be dramatic and the reputation of UBS could also suffer.”

“Banking is people, don’t forget that,” another investor added.

The vice-chair of UBS, Lukas Gähwiler, said it was “simply too soon for any speculation” on potential job cuts but added that the takeover was “a Herculean task” that in the short term would need more people.

Shareholders also feared the mega-bank could harm competition, including within the Swiss mortgage market, adding that UBS should “consider a possible spinoff in one or two years”.

Kelleher said the board was not ruling out a future split of the business, adding: “There are various options that we’re looking at. We need to complete the deal first. We need to stabilise the situation.”

Credit Suisse was sold to UBS in March as panic over the health of the global financial system increased after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank earlier in the month.

By then, Credit Suisse had already been struggling to keep customers and generate profits after a string of scandals, compliance issues and bad financial bets.

Confidence in the bank was nearly wiped out in mid-March after its largest shareholder, the Saudi National Bank, ruled out providing further funding because of regulations that in effect capped its investment.

The Swiss authorities stepped in, originally offering a CHF 50bn (£45bn) line of credit, and eventually ushering in a $3.25bn takeover by Credit Suisse’s larger domestic rival UBS four days later.

Credit Suisse shareholders used the bank’s last-ever annual general meeting on Tuesday to express their own anger over the cut-price takeover deal, blocking executive pay plans and calling for board members to be “put behind bars”.

The bank’s chair, Axel Lehmann, apologised, saying bosses had plans to turn Credit Suisse around but were “thwarted” by market panic. He said the only alternative to the takeover would have been bankruptcy.

A drop in crude inventories and supply disruption from northern Iraq of almost 500,000 barrels per day are also supporting prices that could rally towards the $100 mark, UBS said in its latest oil market report on Tuesday.

“While flows may resume [from Iraq] in the short term, the interruption and the upcoming voluntary production cuts by nine oil producers should help tighten the oil market further,” UBS said in report co-authored by its strategists Giovanni Staunovo, Wayne Gordon and Dominic Schnider.

“As a result, we continue to expect oil prices to recover towards $100 per barrel over the coming quarters.”

Opec+ members including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman and Algeria on April 2 surprised the market and said they would introduce combined voluntary oil production cuts of 1.16 million barrels per day from May until the end of this year.

Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter and Opec's largest producer, will cut its output by 500,000 bpd from May until the end of the year, while the UAE will cut its output by 144,000 bpd for the same period.

Russia, which is part of the 23-member Opec+ group, said the 500,000 bpd cut it was implementing from March to June would continue until the end of the year.

The producers said the precautionary measure was aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market.

The latest pledge of cuts by Opec+, which slashed its collective output by two million barrels per day in October last year, has pushed the volume of the group’s production caps to about 3.6 million bpd, about 3.6 per cent of Opec’s 101.9 million bpd estimated world oil demand this year.

Goldman Sachs, which had reduced its oil price forecast for 2023 on growing supplies and lower demand, now expects Brent to trade at $95 a barrel by the end of this year from a previous $90 estimate, and $100 in 2024 compared with a prior $97 forecast.

The investment bank expects a nearly 90 per cent implementation rate for the 1.16 million bpd combined cut, as the countries that announced them “have a strong compliance track record” and had implemented nearly 90 per cent of the October 2022 cut by January 2023, the investment bank said earlier this month.

Crude prices have rebounded from a 15-month low hit last month due to a banking crisis in the US that spread to Switzerland, leading to the collapse of four lenders and sparking a broad sell-off in financial markets.

Brent, the benchmark for two thirds of the world’s oil, settled 1.7 per cent higher at $85.61 a barrel at the close of trading on Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate, the gauge that tracks US crude, closed up 2.2 per cent at $81.53 a barrel.

Oil is still up about 6 per cent since the Opec+ surprise announcement. However, traders are awaiting data on inflation and economy that will indicate global economic sentiment and potential demand for oil in the quarters to come.

“Given our positive price outlook, we reiterate our investment recommendations,” the UBS strategists said.

“With the oil futures curve downwards sloping (in backwardation) and higher prices likely ahead, we continue to advise risk-taking investors to add long positions in longer-dated Brent oil contracts.”

Falling inventories amid a rise in demand as China's economy, the second-largest in the world after the US, will also support crude prices.

“More interesting is the fall in inventories following the strong rise at the start of the year, which was likely driven by the dip in January demand due to mild weather and recovering production from weather disruptions in December,” UBS said.

However, February data suggested a strong increase in demand, resulting in a modestly undersupplied market that month, it added.

“More recent data shows renewed large on-land inventory drops of more than 30 million barrels over the last three weeks across the US, Europe, Singapore, Japan and Fujairah, suggesting that the market remained undersupplied in March as well,” it said.","['Sarmad Khan', 'Apr']",2023-04-12 00:00:00

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) down nearly 12% versus its year-to-date high is an opportunity for investors to build a position in this quality name, as per a UBS analyst.

Goldman Sachs stock should be worth $385

On Wednesday, Brennan Hawken upgraded the financial services behemoth to “buy” and raised his price target to $385 – about a 17% upside from here.

The analyst is constructive on Goldman Sachs stock because he’s convinced that its trading business could benefit from the recent bank failures.

GS has opportunity to accelerate growth of their asset and wealth management platform and their transactional banking business through attractively priced M&A, especially if stress in banking system presents further inorganic opportunities.

In January, Goldman Sachs said its trading revenue went up 16% (best among peers) in 2022 that helped offset a big hit to its revenue from investment banking.

Why else is he bullish on Goldman Sachs stock?

Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs confirmed that it was shrinking its loss-producing consumer business (read more). That could be a meaningful tailwind for the share price as well, Hawken added.

Other reasons cited for the bullish view on Goldman Sachs stock include the bank’s commitment to expanding its financing business. The analyst said in his research note:

As a [global systemically important bank], the firm is already subject to the highest capital requirements. So, while Basel 4 certainly could increase capital requirements, changes should be less significant than for regional banks.

Goldman Sachs is set to report its Q1 financial results next week. Consensus is for it to earn $8.53 a share this quarter versus $10.76 per share a year ago.",[],2023-04-12 00:00:00

https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/04/11/swiss-parliament-meets-amid-ubs-credit-suisse-deal-criticism/,Swiss parliament meets amid criticism of UBS-Credit Suisse deal,"Swiss politicians voiced their discontent over the takeover of Credit Suisse, criticising the government’s use of emergency measures and blaming the bank’s management.

“Credit Suisse’s leadership has to take responsibility for its actions, that’s not only dictated by fairness,” Hansjoerg Knecht, a member of the Swiss People’s Party, told the upper house of parliament during a special session in Bern. “Tens of thousands of employees worry for their jobs.”

The extraordinary parliamentary meeting, scheduled for three days starting Tuesday, is the latest battleground for the government to justify why it brokered Credit Suisse’s takeover by UBS. The move – described by president Alain Berset as the best option to re-establish confidence in markets – created a banking giant whose assets are more than twice the size of the Swiss economy.

Parliament, just like shareholders, did not get a say on the deal, yet the March 19th agreement was signed off by a small group of senior MPs – the so-called financial delegation. That means the takeover cannot be derailed by the legislative.

READ MORE

One of the members of that delegation – Peter Hegglin of the Center Alliance – highlighted that there had been no other option, though he regretted the situation. “The decision wasn’t easy for me. The banking industry was warned by the 2008 crisis – unfortunately Credit Suisse’s leadership didn’t learn from the crisis. Like in a dramatic tragedy the managers destroyed values and made themselves rich in the process.”

Earlier the government’s intervention was defended by Mr Berset, who said ministers needed to stop the collapse of the bank – which would have taken place within a day or two without the March rescue – and stop fallout beyond Switzerland itself. “The Federal Council was obliged to intervene to maintain stability both in Switzerland and internationally and to protect the economy,” Mr Berset said in the Swiss capital. “A failure of Credit Suisse would have had disastrous consequences.”

Lawmakers are trying to push the government to overhaul too-big-to-fail rules for systemically relevant banks and pursue legal action against management at Credit Suisse. It is unclear at this point which executives might be targeted.

Given the merger has been met with little public enthusiasm and it is an election year, parliament is also trying to curtail government powers in the future: it is attempting to block the use of emergency measures to push through deals like this.

This week is not the last time the topic will be discussed in parliament. An oversight committee has scheduled hearings of the heads of Swiss National Bank, banking watchdog Finma and the finance and justice ministers in May.

Lawmakers are also threatening to initiate a parliamentary inquiry which would have subpoena powers to summon witnesses. A decision on whether a body for this is installed is expected by early May. – Bloomberg",['Tue Apr -'],2023-04-11 00:00:00

Credit Suisse shareholders have suffered a loss of more than 70% this year, as the beleaguered bank has been hit by a series of crises that undermined the confidence of shareholders and customers alike.

And the failure of another major bank after the high-profile collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in the US has rippled through the wider financial sector, with Australian, UK and US banks nursing significant share price falls over the last month.

While the ASX has been rattled by the bank collapses overseas, predictably, the big four banks have fared worse than other ASX200 stocks, losing as much as 15% from previous highs earlier this year. The ASX is down by more than 8% for the comparable period.

Meanwhile, ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott published remarks on the ANZ Blue Notes website today that addressed concerns recent banking shocks could be the precursor to another global financial crisis.

“It’s like that old saying, you know, that history doesn’t repeat, but it rhymes. There are lots of rhymes here that we can see in previous turmoils or crises, including the GFC, but actually, when you really get the microscope out, the causes and what’s going on here are really, really different than the GFC,” Elliott says.

We’re going to take a closer look at what existing and potential investors need to know about Credit Suisse shares after the merger announcement and the potential ramifications for the Australian arm of the company.

Swiss prosecutors have opened an investigation into possible illegal activity in connection with government support for UBS’ rushed takeover of Credit Suisse.

The two banks agreed to merge in March as part of an emergency deal targeted at avoiding a national financial crisis that could have had a knock-on effect globally.

“The Federal Prosecutor’s office wants to proactively fulfill its mission and responsibility to contribute to a clean Swiss financial center and has set up monitoring in order to take immediate action in any situation that falls within its field of activity,” the authority said in a statement.

Last month, Zurich-based UBS was forced by Swiss authorities to take over its longtime domestic rival Credit Suisse in a deal that creates a new bank.

The prosecutor's statement said that the intention of the probe was to “analyze and identify any criminal offenses” associated with the deal, adding that various bodies had been contacted to provide clarifications and information.

The deal has been unpopular locally and on Sunday, Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger reported that the new entity could slash jobs by up to 30 percent.

This comes after UBS agreed to buy rival Credit Suisse for $3.23 billion in stock last month, and assume up to $5.4 billion in losses.

According to a report in Bloomberg, the global head of wealth management at UBS, Iqbal Khan, met with Credit Suisse executives including the local lender’s wealth head Puneet Matta in Singapore. Khan then reportedly told the Credit Suisse staff that the wealth business in India is likely to be retained.

Khan was in Credit Suisse before he left for UBS in 2019. UBS had left India by 2014, exiting the country’s private-wealth market. The return is expected to pave the way for UBS into the market as the number of billionaires in India continues to rise.

As per the report, the merger would see large parts of Credit Suisse’s investment bank wind down. The lender has just over 40 wealth management employees and around 7,000 overall employees in the country.

The deal inked between UBS and Credit Suisse last month includes $108 billion in liquidity assistance for UBS and Credit Suisse from the Swiss central bank. The federal government is providing a loss guarantee of a maximum 9 billion Swiss francs to enable UBS take over Credit Suisse.

This will be activated if losses are actually incurred on this portfolio. In that eventuality, UBS would assume the first 5 billion francs, the federal government the next 9 billion francs, and UBS would assume any further losses, the government said.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swiss-lawmakers-pick-apart-credit-084338369.html,Swiss lawmakers pick apart Credit Suisse woes ahead of deal,"GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland’s parliament opened a special session Tuesday to scrutinize the state-imposed takeover of Swiss bank Credit Suisse by rival UBS — and consider strengthening the legal arsenal to better gird against financial blowups.

The debate could run up to three days, with lawmakers voicing — and needing to iron out — disagreements over the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.25 billion) fusion of Switzerland's top two banks, a thunderclap for a country that prides itself on finesse and acumen in finance.

Swiss authorities stepped in as shares of Credit Suisse plunged last month and depositors pulled their money after the failure of two U.S. banks sparked concerns about the stability of global financial system and the long-troubled lender. Credit Suisse is among 30 “globally systemically important banks,” and authorities worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

“The situation on the financial markets has calmed down, but it is not fully stabilized, and our country — Switzerland — has emerged shaken by this painful episode,” Swiss President Alain Berset said at the session.

He said lawmakers would need to ensure that the legal framework was “as solid as possible to prevent this kind of crisis from happening again.” The executive branch also would look into “too big to fail” rules for key banks passed after the 2008 global financial crisis that may need changing, Berset added.

Lawmakers also are considering accountability for Credit Suisse and concerns about thousands of expected job cuts and looking at state-backed guarantees of over $100 billion aimed at holding the bank together until the merger is completed and buttressing UBS against possible losses.

They also are debating what it will mean for Switzerland to have one giant bank.

Johanna Gapany, a centrist lawmaker and rapporteur for the upper chamber's finance commission, said the parliamentary panel had made three main proposals: change competition rules in light of the emergence of megabank UBS, examine how Credit Suisse executives might be held accountable and block the executive branch from unilaterally releasing more emergency funds for the rescue plan.

Story continues

The proposals showed a ""clear intention to not only prevent this situation from happening again, but to make sure that the solution protects the interests of citizens as much as possible — thus by taking the least risk with the guarantees that have been provided,” Gapany said.

Despite the talk, few concrete results were expected from the session, which is primarily to flesh out ideas — and possibly some vitriol — from lawmakers who all face reelection this fall.

Yvan Lengwiler, an economics professor at the University of Basel, suggested that the debate would play into a longtime “tug-of-war” between lawmakers who have lobbied in favor of Swiss banks over the years and others who have long sought to stiffen regulation.

“It seems that the pendulum, after this debacle we’ve seen, has clearly shifted towards strengthening,” he said. “Two years from now … the political situation might be very different, and it could be quite difficult to get this through parliament.”

Jakob Stark, an upper-house lawmaker from the populist, right-wing Swiss People's Party, said the rescue of Credit Suisse was “was probably right and ultimately unavoidable” but that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority — known as FINMA — must become ”more decisive.""

“It should, for instance, get the authority to impose fines, but then it should also really impose the fines, and particularly on the big institutions,” Stark said of the regulator. ""My feeling is that it was too considerate toward Credit Suisse, perhaps because of a legal basis that wasn’t sufficiently clear.”

The Swiss attorney general’s office has already opened a probe into events surrounding Credit Suisse ahead of the takeover, and the executive branch last week ordered tens of millions in cuts to the bonuses of top Credit Suisse executives.

Lawmakers largely were expected to line up behind the rescue plan — even if reluctantly for some — and were not yet expected to authorize a parliamentary investigation of the epochal rescue of Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old pillar of Swiss banking.

Lengwiler, who specializes in financial market regulation, noted that the combined bank will have a balance sheet that will be twice as large as Switzerland’s annual economy.

That’s nothing new: Both Credit Suisse and UBS had bigger balance sheets than the Swiss economy before the 2008 financial crisis. But this combined bank will be unprecedented in size and heft, presenting new challenges for government officials.

“What’s new here is that it’s the only kid on the block now,” Lengwiler said. “UBS is really the only game in town and … has become extremely dominant, and that is a problem for Switzerland.”

“It’s maybe too large for the country,” he added.

Here are five facts about the 62-year-old banker.

* Swiss national Ermotti began his career as an apprentice at Corner Bank, before getting his first big break in 1987 with a role at Merril Lynch, where he opened their Swiss capital markets operation from scratch.

* Described as suave, charismatic and impeccably dressed, Ermotti, who hails from Switzerland's Italian-speaking canton of Ticino, had thought about becoming a skier or a footballer but decided to stay in banking.

* He joined UBS in 2011 after being passed over for the top job at Italian lender UniCredit. Within six months of joining he was appointed interim CEO in the wake of a $2.3 billion trading scandal, before he was picked to run UBS on a permanent basis until 2020.

* Ermotti, with long experience in investment banking and wealth management, is credited with executing UBS's turnaround and scaling down its investment banking operations after a series of scandals and losses nearly caused the bank's implosion.

* A self-described ""lazy reader"", he has said he prefers skiing down the Swiss slopes of St. Moritz and that he can watch the same film over and over again, citing ""The Sting"" as his favourite.

LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - UBS Group (UBSG.S) has emerged as Switzerland’s one and only global bank with a state-backed rescue of its smaller peer Credit Suisse, a risky bet that makes the Swiss economy more dependent on a single lender.

The move announced late on Sunday in Zurich capped a race against time by regulators to avert a meltdown. Switzerland is pledging roughly 260 billion francs($170 billion) in loans and guarantees to underpin the new group, guarding against further risks undermining the lender.

The transaction – the first rescue of a global bank since the financial crisis of 2008 – grants enormous clout to UBS, ridding it of its main rival. It will change the landscape of banking in Switzerland, where branches of Credit Suisse and UBS are dotted everywhere, sometimes just metres apart.

The banks, two of the most systemically relevant in global finance, hold combined assets of up to 140% of Swiss gross domestic product in a country heavily dependent on finance for its economy.

Following the 2008 financial crash, politicians pledged never to bail out banks again. The Credit Suisse rescue, orchestrated with public money, shows banks' continued vulnerability and how their problems can quickly rebound on their home country.

Rescuing Credit Suisse alone came with a price tag of roughly 260 billion francs of publicly backed loans and guarantees - a third of the Alpine state's economic output.

""The terms of the takeover are very much in UBS's favour,"" said Tobias Straumann of the University of Zurich. ""They were in a strong negotiating position because they didn't want the deal.""

""Under normal circumstances, I would say it is an absolutely fantastic deal for UBS,"" said Johann Scholtz, an analyst at Morningstar.

REVERSAL OF FORTUNES

Soon after the announcement, central banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan said they would enhance dollar swap lines, helping calm investors rattled by turmoil in the banking sector.

The failure of two U.S. banks and a rout in Credit Suisse shares have sent shock waves through markets over the past week.

UBS will pay $3.2 billion for 167-year-old Credit Suisse and assume at least $5.4 billion in losses from unwinding its portfolio of derivatives and other risky assets. Credit Suisse had a market value of about $8 billion at the close on Friday.

Holders of Credit Suisse’s Additional Tier 1 bonds will get wiped out.

The deal marks a twist of fate for the banks. During the great financial crash, it was UBS and not Credit Suisse that needed state support.

The banks' fortunes have diverged sharply over the past year. UBS earned $7.6 billion in profit in 2022, while Credit Suisse lost $7.9 billion. Credit Suisse's shares were down 74% from a year ago, while UBS's are relatively flat.

UBS becomes the undisputed global leader in managing money for the wealthy, with UBS’s leading position in China now complemented by Credit Suisse’s strength in the rest of Asia, the fastest growing region.

UBS also gets to keep the jewel in Credit Suisse’s crown, the domestic bank.

""In the past, when a deal between Credit Suisse and UBS was discussed, a sticking point would be concentration, especially in the domestic market,"" said Morningstar’s Scholtz. ""It is also the most stable part of the business, that generates quite a lot of cash.""

UBS is also taking out a big competitor in securities trading. UBS earned $7.1 billion in revenue from buying and selling stocks, currencies and bonds. Credit Suisse posted about$3.2 billion last year.

STILL SWISS

Credit Suisse's demise has been a blow to Switzerland's reputation for banking and sent shockwaves through global finance.

At a news conference announcing the deal, finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter defended the rescue, saying it was good for Credit Suisse account holders, including her. She said she also banked with UBS. That choice of banks will soon end.

""This solution has risks,"" she conceded, playing down any concerns about the size of the new bank, arguing that any alternative to resolve Credit Suisse's problems risked ""irreparable economic turmoil"".

Seated to her right, UBS Chair Colm Kelleher said the new group would be trimmed of risks, such as investment banking, to fit UBS's conservative culture.

""A new UBS will remain rock solid,"" he said.

Credit Suisse Chair Axel Lehmann, in contrast, was downcast as his bank proved unable to bounce back from a series of scandals and losses.

Late last year, speculation that the bank would go bust drove clients to pull out tens of billions, sealing its fate.

He described Sunday as a ""historic, sad day"".

Employees at the headquarters in Zurich are bracing for massive job cuts, with 10,000 positions potentially on the line, sources told Reuters on Saturday.

Still, it won't be all plain sailing for UBS.

The bank faces risks to complete the deal, potential litigation charges, and regulators may ask the lender to hold more capital in the future, said analysts at Jefferies.

Crucially, management will be distracted by this deal for many months, maybe years, they said.

""We will change, but we will not change that much,"" said UBS Chief Executive Officer Ralph Hamers, who will lead the new banking behemoth. ""We will still be Swiss.""

UBS Group AG has struck a deal to buy Credit Suisse—a rival Swiss bank rocked by financial turmoil—for over $3 billion, the two banks announced Sunday, as bank executives and Swiss officials sprint to contain a crisis sparked in part by the collapse of two major U.S. banks last week.

Key Facts

UBS ultimately agreed to pay $3.2 billion (or 3 billion Swiss Francs) in an all-share deal, with Credit Suisse investors receiving one UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares held, up from a $1 billion initial offer that Credit Suisse reportedly viewed as too low. The deal represents a large discount compared to Credit Suisse’s market capitalization just two days ago: UBS says the acquisition will cost the equivalent of $0.82 (or 0.76 Swiss Francs) per share, less than half Credit Suisse’s $2.01 share price when markets closed Friday. The combined company will have over $5 trillion in total invested assets, and UBS expects to make $8 billion in cost cuts over the next four years, UBS said in a statement late Sunday. The Swiss government helped broker the deal, with an apparent goal of completing the merger before Asian markets open Monday morning. As part of the agreement, the Swiss National Bank—the country’s central bank—offered Credit Suisse and UBS up to $108 billion in liquidity assistance loans, it said in a statement. The Swiss government is also expected to speed the deal up by waiving the six-week waiting period normally required before a merger, according to the New York Times, and Swiss authorities are not requiring UBS to get shareholder approval.

Crucial Quote

“With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,” the Swiss National Bank said.

Big Number

$54 billion. That’s how much Credit Suisse borrowed from the Swiss National Bank on Thursday. The central bank offered to provide liquidity to Credit Suisse “if necessary” hours earlier, but the bank’s share price still slid almost 7% the following day.

Key Background

Shares of Credit Suisse have plummeted in recent weeks, and trading was halted Wednesday after the share price fell up to 21%. On Tuesday, the bank said it had found “material weaknesses” in its 2021 and 2022 financial reporting processes. In response, its biggest backer, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn’t buy any more shares in Credit Suisse. The recent collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S., triggered partially by rising interest rates, caused uncertainty about wider vulnerabilities in the banking system worldwide—concerns that intensified after warning signs appeared at Credit Suisse. But the bank’s downfall wasn’t directly caused by SVB and Signature, and its problems predate the current crisis, as it ended the 2022 fiscal year with a loss of nearly $8 billion. The bank itself and some executives and advisors have also recently been linked to scandals, including alleged fraud and failing to prevent money laundering.

""It's a historic day, and a day we hoped would not come,"" UBS chair Colm Kelleher said on a call Sunday night that included UBS CEO Hamers. No Credit Suisse executives or board members were on the call.

UBS execs said they would move ""fast"" to wind down Credit Suisse's investment bank. The company also said it had taken reserves against Credit Suisse's high-profile litigation matters.

Credit Suisse stock fell more than 52% on Monday while UBS shed around 3%.

Here's what Wall Street is saying early on about the deal.

Vontobel's Andreas Venditti: ""Thanks to the transaction, a collapse of CS has been avoided. This would have had massive consequences for the Swiss economy, the Swiss financial center, and UBS as well. UBS pays CHF 3 bn for a business that was valued multiples of that just a few weeks ago. In addition, it has secured important loss protections. However, there are many uncertainties and significant risks. The UBS investment case changes substantially. The issues currently impacting the global banking sector are not over.""

Goldman Sachs' Lotfi Karoui: ""For credit markets, the read-through is twofold: In both the USD and EUR markets, the excess premium that investors had been demanding to hold European bank credit risk now has room to compress. On Friday, we argued that the performance of the broader European banking sector would remain pressured until clarity is provided on Credit Suisse’s future path and recommended moving to a neutral allocation on banks in the EUR market (from overweight previously). Today’s outcome provides such clarity. In particular, the liquidity and loss guarantees provided by the SNB and the Swiss government are likely to act as dampeners for tail risk and help close the recent valuation gap between European banks and non-financials. As such, we don’t think a neutral allocation is warranted and are shifting back to an overweight allocation. Of course, we are mindful that the situation among US regional banks remains fluid. But as we discussed on Friday, we take comfort from the limited contagion from US regional banks to larger money center banks, a trend we expect will persist. We reiterate our overweight allocation on US money center banks in the USD market.""

Evercore ISI's Krishna Guha: ""The agreement – which should achieve its goal of stabilizing CS – is strongly positive for stability and global markets relative to a no-deal scenario. But the decision to completely write down CHF 15.8bn in CS AT1 debt – which we warned last week could be at risk to enable SNB funding on the scale required – risks spreading contagion through the European banking system via repricing of bail-in debt and equity at other banks. The outcome for equity-holders may also worry investors in other weak banks, particularly but not only in Europe. If this makes it harder to raise equity capital it could have downsides for stability. The CS drama now shifts from negotiation risk to execution risk, which the Swiss authorities are moving aggressively to manage down, but is not zero. Market focus will likely broaden out to other weaker European banks as well as US regional banks.""

Wedbush's Dan Ives: ""With this game of musical chairs happening on the banking sector and nervousness across the financials with the Credit Suisse fire sale to UBS announced over the weekend, we continue to strongly believe the tech trade will be viewed more as the safety trade on the Street looking ahead. So far in 2023 despite all the skeptics and many yelling fire in a crowded theater on the tech sector, NASDAQ is up roughly 13% this year with over the last few weeks more investors quickly moving to large cap tech stocks in a jittery financial backdrop with the SVB black eye moment followed by the CS arranged marriage announced this weekend.""

22V Research's Jacob Funk Kirkegaard: ""Overall, my view is per my note on the ECB decision last week that European banks are well capitalized, have good liquidity (thanks ECB TLTROs) and given the design of the euro area with spreads and volatility in risk free rates will generally tend to hedge interest rate risk much more than US banks do. As such, I do not believe this is the beginning of a new European banking crisis, as at least maturity mismatches and interest rate risks are among those issues with generally a lot of focus (and hedges) and therefore relatively less risk (despite the ECB’s rapid hikes) than apparently among US regional banks. Some repricing of AT1 assets in the EU is plausible, given that investors will now be looking at whether individual banks have “similar footnotes” as CS, but given the strong response from the ECB, this will be isolated events.""

BMO Capital Markets' James Fotheringham: ""U.S. investment banks are waking up to one less global competitor, as UBS management committed to down-sizing CS's trading and investment banking operations; GS, MS, JPM and others should benefit from market share development to offset otherwise-languishing global CIB revenues.""

This dip followed a warning from UBS analysts regarding the company’s Azure cloud segment. UBS downgraded Microsoft’s stock to neutral from buy and lowered the price target to $250 per share from $300. According to UBS analyst Karl Keirstead, Azure is facing “steep growth deceleration,” The market could be reaching saturation. Keirstead also cautioned that Azure’s growth deceleration may be worse in 2023 and 2024 than investors anticipate.

UBS’s downgrade of Microsoft’s stock resulted from the latest round of field checks into the business, which lowered the bank’s confidence in the store. Keirstead also stated that Microsoft’s Office 365, a “remarkably steady machine of late,” could experience slower revenue growth in 2023. Additionally, declining spending on enterprise software from companies cutting costs and slashing jobs could also weigh on Microsoft’s Office 365 business this year.

UBS certainly got a good price.

Then there is the controversial write-off of Credit Suisse’s $17 billion in AT1 bonds.

https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/credit-suisse-lawyer-jumped-to-barclays-ahead-of-ubs-takeover,Credit Suisse Lawyer Jumped to Barclays Ahead of UBS Deal (1),"Credit Suisse Group AG ‘s general counsel for the Americas jumped to Barclays PLC three weeks before an emergency acquisition of the Swiss bank.

Crystal Lalime started Feb. 27 as a regional general counsel and head of investment banking legal at Barclays, according to a person familiar with the matter. She spent almost 18 years at Credit Suisse.

Lalime quit ahead of the March 19 announcement of Credit Suisse’s $3.2 billion fire sale to Swiss rival UBS Group AG in a government-brokered deal designed to stem the fallout in financial markets from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

Credit Suisse in 2020 tapped Lalime to take over the top legal role for its investment bank just before it was swept up in the implosion of Archegos Capital Management LP, the family office of financier Bill Hwang.

A US Senate committee investigating that financial disaster sent a letter to Lalime in April 2021 requesting information about Credit Suisse’s dealings with Archegos, whose failure also affected UBS and other financial institutions. Both banks shook up their legal and compliance ranks in the Archegos aftermath.

At Barclays, Lalime replaced Mark Shelton, who was hired in 2015 as a New York-based general counsel for its investment banking unit and Americas legal chief.

Shelton had previously been co-chair of the financial institutions practice at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. The law firm hired him in 2014 from UBS, where he was Americas general counsel and global head of investigations.

Credit Suisse managing director Barbara Nottebohm has replaced Lalime as acting general counsel of the company’s Americas, investment bank, and capital release unit, according to her LinkedIn profile.

Markus Diethelm, a longtime former top lawyer at UBS, joined Credit Suisse last year as general counsel. The status of Diethelm and other lawyers working at Credit Suisse remains uncertain given the pending transaction with UBS.

Credit Suisse declined a request for comment.

Move to Barclays

Barclays has seen its corporate law department be raided in recent years by other financial services firms.

In December, Alexander Greenberg, a former head of intellectual property and Americas cybersecurity legal at Barclays, left to become general counsel for Golden Recursion Inc., a decentralized finance startup backed by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz that raised $40 million last October.

That same month Tidal Partners, an advisory shop formed last year by two dealmakers from investment banking firm Centerview Partners Holdings LP, announced its hire of chief operating and legal officer Elizabeth Hyon, a former Americas head of investment banking litigation at Barclays.

In September, alternative asset management firm Cerberus Capital Management LP brought on Steven Glynn—a global co-head for securitized products legal at Barclays—as a managing director and deputy general counsel. Glynn had spent more than a dozen years at Barclays.

This month the London-based bank also saw its general counsel for Europe, David Jackson, take on a new role as legal chief for its corporate center function.

He now oversees in-house lawyers in a number of different areas, including commercial and corporate, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, M&A, public policy, and strategic investments. A member of the legal executive committee at Barclays, Jackson has worked for the bank since 2007.

Barclays in 2020 tapped South African lawyer Stephen Shapiro to serve as its global general counsel and company secretary.

Shapiro succeeded former Barclays legal chief Robert Hoyt, who had been hired in 2013 from Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services Group Inc. Hoyt is now the top lawyer at HSBC Holdings PLC.",[],

Switzerland's parliament rejected on Wednesday the government's 109 billion Swiss francs ($120.82 billion) aid for Credit Suisse's merger with UBS, leaving the fallen bank's hastily arranged rescue without a largely symbolic parliamentary blessing.

While the upper house had approved the government's contribution to the rescue package, parliament's lower, and larger chamber, pushed back again on Wednesday.

It had already rejected the proposals in a late night session on Tuesday, forcing the upper house to find a solution when it met again on Wednesday.

Seeking a compromise, the upper house passed changes to the measure on Wednesday morning, but it was not enough to sway the lower house lawmakers.

They turned it down by 103 votes to 71 in favour, a similar level of opposition to the night before.

Speaking just before the lower house vote, Cedric Wermuth, the co-president of the Social Democrats said the party just could not support the funding.

While the government's commitment, made using emergency law, cannot be overturned, the vote marks a symbolic rebuke for the authorities, whose decision to largely bypass the nation's legislative has angered many politicians.

""This decision has no impact on the takeover of Credit Suisse decided on March 19,"" the Swiss Finance Ministry said after the vote.

The support package had already been given binding approval by the parliament's finance delegation, due to the urgency of the matter, it said.

""The funds have already been fully committed,"" it added.

Lawmakers who backed an approval of the deal, voiced concern about Switzerland's image.

""It doesn't really matter what we decide in detail, but it would really send a bad signal if these loans were rejected,"" said Eva Herzog, who is a member of the Council of States, the upper house, before the vote.

Following a day of heated debates held in the country's four national languages, that continued into early morning hours, the upper house passed changes aimed at winning over the sceptics.

They included a proposal for Switzerland's federal government to draft an amendment to the country's Banking Act. Its aim would be to reduce the risks posed by systemically relevant banks, such as Credit Suisse and UBS for Switzerland, by, for example, raising capital requirements and restricting bonuses.

Addressing parliament before the vote on Wednesday, finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter told lawmakers to consider what message their rejection of the rescue would send to the world.

""What signal do you want to give internationally, are the institutions reliable, do you value financial market stability in a place where you already have a financial centre with a certain importance?""

Lawmakers were recalled to the country's capital, Bern, for the rare extraordinary session to discuss the Swiss government's open chequebook response to a collapse that many in the country have blamed on Credit Suisse's top management.

Last month's shotgun marriage which saw the bank taken over by rival UBS for 3 billion Swiss francs and propped up with more than 250 billion Swiss francs in guarantees and support has drawn widespread criticism.

The government invoked Swiss emergency law to sign it off to the ire of the almost 250 lawmakers left without a say.

""The use of emergency law has reached a level in the last three years that is beginning to annoy me,"" Hansjoerg Knecht, a member of Parliament's upper house, said on Tuesday.

Abraham initiated coverage with a Neutral rating and a price target of $19. This rating indicates that the stock is expected to perform in line with the market or benchmark index. Additionally, the price target of $19 suggests that UBS predicts the stock will reach this value within the next 12 months.

UBS’s coverage of Capital Southwest Corp followed the company’s recent announcement of its fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 financial results. During the fourth quarter, the company reported a net investment income of $0.47 per share, surpassing the consensus estimate of $0.43 per share. Furthermore, the company’s net asset value increased to $28.22 per share, up from $27.68 per share in the previous quarter.

Capital Southwest Corp is a publicly-traded business development company that invests in middle-market companies throughout the United States. The company’s portfolio features investments in a variety of industries, including healthcare, technology, and energy.

CSWC Stock Performance on April 11, 2023: Low Trading Volume and Concerns Over Earnings Growth

On April 11, 2023, Carlyle Secured Lending (CSWC) stock opened at 17.39, slightly lower than the previous close of 17.45. Throughout the day, the stock traded in a narrow range between 17.39 and 17.44, with a volume of only 900 shares. This was significantly lower than the average volume of the past three months, which was 310,752 shares.

Despite the low trading volume, CSWC’s market cap remained at $604.8 million. The company’s earnings growth for the past year was -29.78%, which was a cause for concern for investors. However, the company’s earnings growth for this year was a positive 19.25%, which was a significant improvement.

CSWC’s revenue growth for the past year was a positive 50.34%, which was a good sign for the company. The P/E ratio was 12.7, which meant that the stock was not overpriced.

In comparison to other investment managers in the sector, CSWC’s stock performance was not very impressive. Carlyle Secured Lending (CGBD) was up 0.61%, PennantPark Floating Rate Capital (PFLT) was up 0.38%, and MidCap Financial Investments (MFIC) was up 0.81%.

CSWC’s next reporting date was scheduled for June 5, 2023, and the EPS forecast for this quarter was $0.60. The company’s annual revenue for the past year was $89.5 million, and their annual profit was $42.8 million. The net profit margin was 47.84%, which was a positive sign for the company.

Overall, CSWC’s stock performance on April 11, 2023, was not very remarkable. The low trading volume and the lack of executives to display did not inspire confidence in investors. However, the positive earnings growth for this year and the high net profit margin were good signs for the company’s future.

Capital Southwest Corp (CSWC) Stock Predicted to Rise 26.22% by Analysts for 2023

On April 11, 2023, Capital Southwest Corp (CSWC) had a median target price of $22.00, according to CNN Money. This represents a 26.22% increase from the last price of $17.43. The high estimate for the stock’s price was $24.00, while the low estimate was $21.00.

https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/3/19/ubs-to-buy-credit-suisse-to-bring-security-and-stability,UBS to buy Credit Suisse for $3.24bn in government-brokered deal,"Authorities had been scrambling to rescue Credit Suisse before financial markets reopened on Monday.

Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS, has agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.24bn), officials from the banks have said, in a deal designed to contain a widening crisis of confidence in global finance.

The agreement, announced late on Sunday, includes 100 billion francs ($108bn) in liquidity assistance for UBS and Credit Suisse from the Swiss central bank.

“With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,” the Swiss central bank said.

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) said that there was a risk that Credit Suisse could have become “illiquid, even if it remained solvent, and it was necessary for the authorities to take action”.

To enable UBS to take over Credit Suisse, the federal government is providing a loss guarantee of a maximum of 9 billion francs ($9.7bn) for a clearly defined part of the portfolio, the government said.

This will be activated if losses are actually incurred on this portfolio. In that eventuality, UBS would assume the first 5 billion francs ($5.4bn), the federal government the next 9 billion francs ($9.7bn), and UBS would assume any further losses, the government said.

Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old bank, has been the biggest name ensnared in market turmoil unleashed by the recent collapse of United States lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, forcing it to tap $54bn in central bank funding last week.

Authorities had been scrambling to rescue Credit Suisse, among the world’s largest wealth managers, before financial markets reopened on Monday.

FINMA, which said it had approved the takeover, said recent measures to stabilise itself were “not enough to restore confidence in the bank, however, and more far-reaching options were also examined”.

UBS and Credit Suisse are both in a group of the 30 global systemically important banks watched closely by regulators, and Credit Suisse’s failure would ripple throughout the entire financial system.

The announcement came in a make-or-break weekend after some rivals grew cautious in their dealings with the struggling Swiss lender, and its regulators urged it to pursue a deal with UBS.

The two banks’ fortunes have diverged sharply over the past year. UBS earned $7.6bn in profit in 2022, while Credit Suisse lost $7.9bn. Credit Suisse’s shares are down 74 percent from a year ago, while UBS’s are relatively flat.",[],2023-03-19 00:00:00

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/banking-giant-ubs-announces-acquisition-of-credit-suisse-amid-financial-turmoil,Banking giant UBS announces acquisition of Credit Suisse amid financial turmoil,"BERN, Switzerland (AP) — Banking giant UBS is buying its smaller rival Credit Suisse in an effort to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in global banking, Swiss President Alain Berset announced on Sunday night.

Swiss president Alain Berset, who did not specify a value of the deal, called the announcement “one of great breadth for the stability of international finance. An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.”

Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s globally systemic important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.

Sunday’s news conference follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further bank panics. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse’s share price began plummeting this week.

READ MORE: Analysis: Why Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed so fast

The 167-year-old Credit Suisse already received a $50 billion (54 million Swiss francs) loan from the Swiss National Bank, which briefly caused a rally in the bank’s stock price. Yet the move did not appear to be enough to stem an outflow of deposits, according to news reports.

Still, many of Credit Suisse’s problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.

The deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn’t invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10 percent.

On Friday, shares dropped 8 percent to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.

Its current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.

While smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.

Despite the banking turmoil, the European Central Bank on Thursday approved a large, half-percentage point increase in interest rates to try to curb stubbornly high inflation, saying Europe’s banking sector is “resilient,” with strong finances.

ECB President Christine Lagarde said the banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.

The Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.","['Jamey Keaten', 'Associated Press', 'Ken Sweet']",2023-03-19 15:11:27-04:00
https://menafn.com/1105985472/Heated-Debates-In-Parliament-Over-UBS-Credit-Suisse-Bailout,Heated Debates In Parliament Over UBS-Credit Suisse Bailout,"The Swiss Senate, meeting in an extraordinary session, has approved government credits granted as part of last month's UBS-Credit Suisse merger. The House of Representatives is expected to vote later in the evening.

The Senate backed the CHF109 billion ($120 billion) government credits on Tuesday by 29 votes to six, with seven abstentions. At the same time it called on the government to answer a long list of questions about the deal and its consequences. The government has already promised a full report to parliament within 12 months.

This is only the third extraordinary parliamentary session in more than two decades – after one on the collapse of Swissair and one on measures to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. Many politicians are angry that parliament was not consulted on the deal to save ailing Credit Suisse and the government credits granted as part of the package.

Parliament cannot block the deal, which was done under emergency legislation with approval from the six-member parliamentary finance delegation, but it can impose conditions notably on how the CHF109 billion is used. The Green Party, for example, wants guarantees on climate sustainability, and there have been calls for limits on bank managers' salaries and bonuses.

Interior Minister Alain Berset, who holds the rotating Swiss presidency this year, opened the session with a defence of the emergency deal, telling parliamentarians that the clock was ticking and“the government was forced to act, in the interest of the country, the institutions and the national economy”. He said confidence in Credit Suisse had not disappeared overnight but had been eroded for years by directors who had not learned the lessons of the previous financial crisis.

Indeed, Credit Suisse managers came in for some harsh criticism. In their greed for more profit they had ignored risks, Peter Hegglin of the Centre Party told the session. Social Democrat Eva Herzog said the 2008 financial crisis had not been enough to make the“Wolf of Wall Street” type of banker disappear. She and other politicians called for liability suits and claims for damages.

""Credit Suisse shareholders will receive 1 UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares,"" UBS said in a statement. However, this transaction means a ""complete write-down) of 16 billion CHF ($17.28 billion) of Credit Suisse bonds that will become worth nothing.

The Swiss government has offered 9 billion CHF ($9.72 billion) to UBS ""assume potential losses arising from certain assets that UBS takes over as part of the transaction, should any future losses exceed a certain threshold."" The Swiss National Bank will also offer UBS a 100 billion CHF ($108 billion) credit line to sweeten the terms.

""[A]s far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue. We have structured a transaction that will preserve the value left in the business while limiting our downside exposure. Acquiring Credit Suisse’s capabilities in wealth, asset management, and Swiss universal banking will augment UBS’s strategy of growing its capital-light businesses,"" said UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher.

Financial Times reported that the two banks had little interaction and that the Swiss government is working on changing rules that require a six-week shareholder comment period.

Despite a CHF 50 billion (about $54 billion) loan from the Swiss government, Credit Suisse could not restore investor confidence and stave off a steep decline in its share price.

The bank has been plagued by a series of missteps in the last year, and the banking crisis that was spurred by the failure of Silicon Valley Bank did not help the bank's ailing stock price. Most recently, the firm found ""material weakness"" in its accounting procedures, delaying its annual report and sparking questions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

About six months ago, the bank underwent a restructuring in an effort to shake off scandals and losses.

SINGAPORE/HONG KONG, March 20 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse staff arriving to work in Asian financial centres on Monday morning fretted about retrenchments and retaining business after larger Swiss rival UBS agreed to swallow the 167-year-old bank in a state-backed rescue.

""I don't know if I get to stay, leave, or should I consider my options now?"" said one Southeast Asia-based banker, who like other staff spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.

The banker also complained of pressure from clients to provide answers within 24 hours to questions about the UBS deal.

Late on Sunday, Swiss authorities capped a tense week of markets by engineering a 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.24 billion)takeover of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) by UBS (UBSG.S), supported by billions in state funding, while angering holders of risky bonds by writing down their debt to zero.

Credit Suisse employs 50,000 people globally across wealth management, investment banking and asset management operations, with more than 150 offices in 50 countries.

Credit Suisse had been steadily losing wealth management market share to UBS and to more well-capitalised U.S. banks in investment banking in the last few years, but remained the second-biggest wealth manager in Asia, behind only its acquirer.

""It's an extremely sad day to see us ending our legacy this way,"" said one Singapore-based senior employee in Credit Suisse's wealth management unit.

The bank told staff its wealth assets are operationally separate from UBS for now, but once they merged, clients might want to consider moving some assets to another bank if concentration was a concern, according to an internal memo.

Credit Suisse said it would still press ahead with its annual investment conference that kicks off in Hong Kong on Tuesday, although media are no longer invited.

""I have no idea what it means to still continue 'business as usual' when we're not even sure our job is going to be there,"" said one Hong-Kong-based employee.

As a giant wall backdrop as high as the ceiling with ""Credit Suisse AIC"" emblazed on it glowed in a hotel lobby, the bank said its chairman and CEO would not turn up at the event.

Credit Suisse shares plunged 60% in early trade on Monday, while UBS lost 15%, as early investor optimism about official efforts to stem a banking crisis quickly evaporated.

Outside its office near Singapore's central business district, nearby coffee shops, usually bustling with bankers from Credit Suisse and rivals, were less crowded early on Monday.

Some of the bank's employees brushed aside questions from Reuters journalists waiting outside the office lobby.

UBS warned on Sunday that it would pare back much of Credit Suisse's investment bank, which Credit Suisse had planned to spin off.

The Swiss Bank Employees Association on Monday called on UBS to keep job cuts to an ""absolute minimum"".

UBS and Credit Suisse sources said Southeast Asia was among the regions where the banks had the most overlap on the wealth management and investment banking teams.

""Investment banking stands out and that could be where the pain is felt most for Credit Suisse,"" a senior executive at UBS said.

Credit Suisse is ranked 20th on the league tables for equity capital markets for the first quarter in Asia Pacific including Japan, according to data from Refinitiv, with a 1.1% market share.

Still, it remains a powerful equity capital markets entity in Southeast Asia's growing markets and shares the second spot with a 9.3% market share, up from 3.2% a year earlier.

Representational image.(AFP)

“Credit Suisse’s leadership has to take responsibility for its actions, that’s not only dictated by fairness,” Hansjoerg Knecht, a member of the Swiss People’s Party, told the upper house of parliament during a special session in Bern. “Tens of thousands of employees worry for their jobs.”

The extraordinary parliamentary meeting, scheduled for three days starting Tuesday, is the latest battleground for the government to justify why it brokered Credit Suisse’s takeover by UBS Group AG.

The move — described by President Alain Berset as the best option to re-establish confidence in markets — created a banking giant whose assets are more than twice the size of the Swiss economy.

Parliament, just like shareholders, didn’t get a say on the deal, yet the March 19 agreement was signed off by a small group of senior MPs — the so-called financial delegation. That means the takeover can’t be derailed by the legislative.

One of the members of that delegation — Peter Hegglin of the Center Alliance — highlighted that there had been no other option, though he regretted the situation.

“The decision wasn’t easy for me,” he said. “The banking industry was warned by the 2008 crisis — unfortunately, Credit Suisse’s leadership didn’t learn from the crisis,” he said. “Like in a dramatic tragedy, the managers destroyed values and made themselves rich in the process.”

Earlier, the government’s intervention was defended by Berset, who said ministers needed to stop the collapse of the bank — which would have taken place within a day or two without the March 19 rescue — and stop fallout beyond Switzerland itself.

“The Federal Council was obliged to intervene to maintain stability both in Switzerland and internationally and to protect the economy,” Berset said in the Swiss capital. “A failure of Credit Suisse would have had disastrous consequences.”

Lawmakers are trying to push the government to overhaul too-big-to-fail rules for systemically relevant banks and pursue legal action against management at Credit Suisse. It’s unclear at this point which executives might be targeted.

Given the merger has been met with little public enthusiasm and it’s an election year, parliament is also trying to curtail government powers in the future: They are attempting to block the use of emergency measures to push through deals like this.

This week isn’t the last time the topic will be discussed in parliament. The oversight committee has scheduled hearings of the heads of Swiss National Bank, banking watchdog Finma and the finance and justice ministers in May.

Lawmakers are also threatening to initiate a parliamentary inquiry, which would have subpeona powers to summon witnesses. A decision on whether a body for this is installed is expected for early May.",[],2023-04-11 17:46:28+05:30

https://menafn.com/1105988770/UBS-Predicts-Tighter-Oil-Market-Higher-Prices-Due-to-OPEC-Production-Cuts,"UBS Predicts Tighter Oil Market, Higher Prices Due to OPEC+ ...","(MENAFN) UBS has predicted that the voluntary production cuts by nine members of the OPEC+ group will help tighten the oil market and boost prices. In a report released on Tuesday, the Swiss lender cited a drop in crude inventories and supply disruption from northern Iraq of almost 500,000 barrels per day as additional factors supporting prices that could rally towards $100 per barrel. UBS expects oil prices to recover towards $100 per barrel over the coming quarters as the combined voluntary production cuts by the nine oil producers will help tighten the oil market further.



On April 2nd, OPEC+ members including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, and Algeria announced that they would introduce combined voluntary oil production cuts of 1.16 million barrels per day from May until the end of this year. Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter and OPEC's largest producer, agreed to cut its output by 500,000 bpd from May until the end of the year, while the UAE will cut its output by 144,000 bpd for the same period. Russia, which is part of the 23-member OPEC+ group, said the 500,000 bpd cut it was implementing from March to June would continue until the end of the year.



UBS analysts Giovanni Staunovo, Wayne Gordon, and Dominic Schnider wrote in the report, “While flows may resume [from Iraq] in the short term, the interruption and the upcoming voluntary production cuts by nine oil producers should help tighten the oil market further” [1]. The precautionary measure was aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market, according to the producers.



The report highlights the potential for oil prices to recover towards $100 per barrel as a result of the voluntary production cuts. However, the report also notes that the situation remains uncertain due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and other factors that could impact oil demand and supply. The report states that while the recent OPEC+ production cuts will provide support to oil prices, the market will remain vulnerable to unexpected events such as supply disruptions or changes in demand patterns.



In conclusion, UBS has predicted that the voluntary production cuts by nine members of the OPEC+ group will help tighten the oil market and boost prices. While the recent cuts provide support to oil prices, the market remains vulnerable to unexpected events such as supply disruptions or changes in demand patterns. The situation remains uncertain due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions, and as such, the trajectory of oil prices remains uncertain in the coming quarters.

https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/our-approach/marketnews/article.1585717.html,Let's chat about ChatGPT,"We view ChatGPT-3 as the current leader in a fast growing market that will see significant investment and development by leading, large technology companies globally. Like prior technology developments, we believe artificial intelligence (AI) will ultimately be additive to employment and economic growth.

No, this wasn’t written by ChatGPT…but it probably could have been

ChatGPT-3 is a chatbot developed by OpenAI, a US-based artificial intelligence research lab. Many consumers are familiar with chatbots, but less so with the underlying technology. ChatGPT-3 uses a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) to generate text that is largely identical to human conversation. GPT is part of the broader family of large language models, which are AI models that understand and can generate text.

Large language models are compelling because of their flexibility. With minimal training, large language models can complete sentences, translate a foreign language, summarize information from multiple sources, and generate content ranging from technical answers to humorous vignettes.

Enormous amounts of data from a range of sources are used in the training process. ChatGPT-3 ingested content from books, academic papers, and the entirety of Wikipedia. According to OpenAI, ChatGPT-3 was trained on over 45 terabytes of data. The system iteratively and without supervision learned to predict the next word in a sequence of text. This unsupervised learning required a network of distributed computers, which allowed for a faster learning process than could have been accomplished using a single computer. The combination of a vast amount of ingested data and massive computing power resulted in a model with 175 billion parameters, making it one of the largest language models ever created. Parameters in large language models are essentially the values that the model is solving.

Use cases, from the source

Rather than speculate ourselves, we asked ChatGPT for some potential use cases. Here’s its response:

“ChatGPT has many potential use cases including chatbots for customer service and mental health support, personal assistants, content creation, language translation, knowledge management, and education/training.”

We see ChatGPT as an engine that will eventually power human interactions with computer systems in a familiar, natural, and intuitive way. As ChatGPT stated, large language models can be put to work as a communication engine in a variety of applications across a number of vertical markets.

Glaringly absent in its answer is the use of ChatGPT in search engines. Microsoft, which is an investor in OpenAI, is integrating ChatGPT into its Bing search engine. The use of a large language model enables more complex and more natural searches and extract deeper meaning and better context from source material. This is ultimately expected to deliver more robust and useful results.

Is AI coming for your job?

Every wave of new and disruptive technology has incited fears of mass job losses due to automation, and we are already seeing those fears expressed relative to AI generally and ChatGPT specifically. The year 1896, when Henry Ford rolled out his first automobile, was probably not a good year for buggy whip makers. When IBM introduced its first mainframe, the System/360, in 1964, office workers feared replacement by mechanical brains that never made mistakes, never called in sick, and never took vacations.

There are certainly historical cases of job displacement due to new technology adoption, and ChatGPT may unseat some office workers or customer service reps. However, we think AI tools broadly will end up as part of the solution in an economy that has more job openings than available workers.

However, economic history shows that technology of any sort (i.e., manufacturing technology, communications technology, information technology) ultimately makes productive workers more productive and is net additive to employment and economic growth.

How big is the opportunity?

The broad AI hardware and services market was nearly USD 36bn in 2020, based on IDC and Bloomberg Intelligence data. We expect the market to grow by 20% CAGR to reach USD 90bn by 2025. Given the relatively early monetization stage of conversational AI, we estimate that the segment accounted for 10% of the broader AI’s addressable market in 2020, predominantly from enterprise and consumer subscriptions.

That said, user adoption is rapidly rising. ChatGPT reached its first 1 million user milestone in a week, surpassing Instagram to become the quickest application to do so. Similarly, we see strong interest from enterprises to integrate conservational AI into their existing ecosystem. As a result, we believe conversational AI’s share in the broader AI’s addressable market can climb to 20% by 2025 (USD 18–20bn). Our estimate may prove to be conservative; they could be even higher if conversational AI improvements (in terms of computing power, machine learning, and deep learning capabilities), availability of talent, enterprise adoption, spending from governments, and incentives are stronger than expected.

How to invest in AI?

We see artificial intelligence as a horizontal technology that will have important use cases across a number of applications and industries. From a broader perspective, AI, along with big data and cybersecurity, forms what we call the ABCs of technology. We believe these three major foundational technologies are at inflection points and should see faster adoption over the next few years as enterprises and governments increase their focus and investments in these areas.

Conservational AI is currently in its early stages of monetization and costs remain high as it is expensive to run. Instead of investing directly in such platforms, interested investors in the short term can consider semiconductor companies, and cloud-service providers that provides the infrastructure needed for generative AI to take off. In the medium to long term, companies can integrate generative AI to improve margins across industries and sectors, such as within healthcare and traditional manufacturing.

Outside of public equities, investors can also consider opportunities in private equity (PE). We believe the tech sector is currently undergoing a new innovation cycle after 12–18 months of muted activity, which provides interesting and new opportunities that PE can capture through early-stage investments.

https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/our-approach/marketnews/article.1582167.html,2023 energy outlook: Favoring crude oil,"Crude oil: Still constructive

We expect crude oil prices to rise in 2023 for several reasons. With China reopening, oil demand looks set to exceed 2019 levels and hit a record high in 2H23. Emerging Asia, including India, should return to driving oil demand growth in 2023. Meanwhile, Russian oil production should fall in 2023 due to the European Union's embargo on Russian crude and refined products (to come into force on 5 February). While production outside the OPEC+ group, which is primarily driven by the US, will likely grow again in 2023, the increase should only be modest following years of underinvestment in building new supply.



So, to keep the market in balance, we expect OPEC+ to ease their production cuts once again in 2023 and provide more barrels to the market to cover rising oil demand amid less Russian production. With OECD oil inventories (commercial and strategic) standing at the lowest level since 2004 and spare capacity set to keep dwindling in 2023, we continue to believe higher prices are needed to slow down oil demand growth and encourage investments in new production.

We therefore continue to expect oil prices to move above USD 100/bbl over the coming months, with Brent trading at USD 110/bbl at mid-2023 and end 2023 (WTI USD 107/bbl).



Given our positive price outlook, we reiterate our investment recommendations. With the oil futures curve downward sloped (in backwardation) and higher prices likely ahead, we continue to advise risk-taking investors to add long positions in longer-dated Brent oil contracts. Alternatively, investors can make use of lower spot prices and high option implied volatility by selling Brent’s downside price risks over the next six months. Another way to gain exposure is through Brent crude oil first generation indices. Such strategies should benefit from solid roll returns on top of the expected spot appreciation. We set our stop-loss at USD 75/bbl, targeting a level of USD 110/bbl. But considering oil’s volatility of more than 40%, this strategy requires investors to have an elevated risk appetite.

Muted supply growth in non-OPEC+

On the supply side, the US should lead production growth outside of OPEC+ in 2023, with the usual suspect—Brazil, Norway, and Guyana—also increasing production. We expect non-OPEC+ to add around 1.3mbpd in 2023. But the US supply additions will likely be smaller compared to historical patterns. Back in 2018, when oil prices were significantly below today’s levels, US oil production rose by 2.2mbpd—crude rose by nearly 1.6mbpd, and natural gas liquid (NGL) production increased by nearly 0.6mbpd; production of the latter is driven by more factors than just oil prices. In 2022, with oil prices at a multi-year high, US crude production rose by only 0.5mbpd (total oil production: 1.1mbpd, with NGL contributing nearly 0.6mbpd).

A big reason is because the supply response from US oil producers with short lead cycles (i.e., shale oil) to higher prices is different now than in the past. Shale producers are more focused on capital discipline today—such as reducing debts or paying higher dividends—instead of increasing production growth. Another factor limiting growth is the fast rise in costs due to elevated inflation, a tight US labor market, and other supply chain constraints. These factors are likely to slow production growth in 2023 as well, limiting US crude production growth to 0.6mbpd in 2023, in our view (total oil production: 0.9mbpd, with NGL contributing 0.3mbpd).

Holding a positive outlook

In sum, supply growth from non-OPEC+ should trail demand growth, making the world once again dependent on more oil from OPEC+. And with OECD inventories (commercial and strategic) at the lowest level since 2004 and spare capacity set to keep dwindling, higher prices are likely needed to help balance markets.

https://commercialobserver.com/2023/03/market-reacts-credit-suisse-ubs-shotgun-wedding/,Market Reacts to Credit Suisse and UBS Shotgun Wedding,"The sudden purchase of Credit Suisse by rival UBS over the weekend stunned the finance world and created new questions about the true extent of a banking crisis that began with U.S. regional banks and now has a global shadow.

UBS acquired Credit Suisse on Sunday for roughly $3.25 billion, just days after Switzerland’s Central Bank provided Credit Suisse with a $54 billion capital injection on March 16 to quell the concerns of worried investors. The deal, which was brokered by the Swiss government, received support from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who released a joint statement Sunday shortly after the acquisition became public.

“We welcome the announcements by the Swiss authorities today to support financial stability,” Yellen and Powell said in the statement. “The capital and liquidity positions of the U.S. banking system are strong, and the U.S. financial system is resilient. We have been in close contact with our international counterparts to support their implementation.”

The precipitous fall of Credit Suisse — a Switzerland-based megabank which had roughly $1.3 trillion worth of assets under management at the end of 2022 — came after Credit Suisse saw its stock drop by nearly 70 percent on the SIX Swiss stock exchange over a span of six days, beginning March 14. The 167-year-old financial institution had a market cap as high as $78 billion in 2009, according to MarcoTrends.net.

Credit Suisse shares were trading at less than a single Swiss franc Monday morning.

The Swiss government agreed to provide roughly 100 billion Swiss francs to UBS to facilitate the deal, an amount equal to nearly $108 billion in U.S. dollars.

“An acquisition is definitely a better outcome than a failure, so in that sense it’s good news,” said Alexi Savov, professor of finance at NYU Stern School of Business. “Whether the price is right, I don’t know, but I think it’s remarkable given Credit Suisse’s market cap over the years. Given where we are now … it’s much better to have an acquisition than a disorderly liquidation.”

But Credit Suisse bondholders are now feeling pain from the banking behemoth’s demise. Parameters of the deal included writing down roughly $17 billion worth of tier one AT1 bonds — or hybrid bonds that sit just below common equity tier one capital, banks’ primary source of capital — to zero.

Justin Kennedy, co-founder and managing partner of 3650 REIT, said this decision by Swiss regulators to write down tier one bonds to zero could harm market conditions going forward.

“There may have been specific terms in Credit Suisse’s AT1 capital that provided this outcome, but if they decided to wipe out that capital as a fiat decision of the regulator to make the UBS deal happen, I think that’s bad for the market,” Kennedy told CO.

Kennedy noted, however, that both the Dow Jones Industrial and S&P 500 stock indexes reacted favorably to the news Monday morning, and that the deal made by UBS and Swiss regulators was the only possible solution given the turmoil Credit Suisse quickly found itself in.

“For the Credit Suisse situation, this was the most likely and powerful outcome for the market that most people expected,” Kennedy said. “The second [option] was the Swiss themselves would take it over and try to recapitalize, because there’s just not an organization in Switzerland that could do it. They weren’t going to do it with Deutsche Bank.”

While the acquisition of Credit Suisse was made to calm markets and restore faith in the banking system, it remains unclear how the purchase will impact the commercial mortgage-backed securities market going forward.

Following the purchase, Barclays analysts Lea Overby and Anuj Jain issued a report that analyzed CMBS tenant exposure to both UBS and Credit Suisse and the overall market fallout for CMBS securities following the purchase.

“AAA spreads look relatively cheap, but we expect CMBS spreads at the top of the capital stack mostly to move in line with the broader markets,” Overby and Jain wrote. “However, we believe BBB- bonds bear substantial risk of underperforming, given the continued drumbeat of negative news for CRE assets.”

The buildings carrying tenancy exposure to UBS and Credit Suisse include 11 Madison Avenue and 787 Seventh Avenue in New York City, One North Wacker Drive in Chicago, and One Stamford Forum in Stamford, Conn.

3650 REIT’s Kennedy was not optimistic about the current state of commercial real estate (CRE) lending. He noted that shrinking assets is the most likely path regional banks will take in the face of fleeing deposits, loss of confidence and higher interest rates, and that the office sector of CRE is an “out-of-favor asset class.”

“If you look at CMBS, everybody is talking about office sector risk, but we’re really just at the beginning of that,” Kennedy noted. “You can see it in the delinquency rate: It’s less than 4 percent, and it went to 10 percent in the Global Financial Crisis and 10 percent in the pandemic, and we’re still in the [3 percent range].”

“By any standard, there’s pain to come in the true credit sense of real estate, which is going to impact the banks further, particularly the smaller and regional banks where commercial real estate [comprises] a larger percentage of assets,” he added.

GENEVA (AP) — The Swiss attorney general’s office says it has opened a probe into the events surrounding embattled bank Credit Suisse, which is to be taken over by rival UBS.

Switzerland's government and financial regulators helped engineer the hastily arranged, $3.25 billion agreement that was aimed in part to help calm worries about the global financial system and will leave the country with a single huge global bank.

The attorney general's office said Monday that it wanted to “proactively fulfill its remit and its responsibility to contribute to a clean Swiss financial sector.” It said that it has set up “monitoring” that would enable it to get involved immediately if any offenses were committed that come under its auspices.

The office said the probe falls short of a formal investigation and is not a criminal inquiry. The office was responding to an emailed request Monday for comment after the Financial Times reported about the probe over the weekend. The statement made no reference to UBS.

Both banks declined to comment about the probe.

Prosecutors said they want to gain an overview of the events surrounding Credit Suisse and to “secure and evaluate the available information” to analyze and identify any relevant offenses. It stressed that it cannot anticipate the result of the “clarifications” it has set in motion and didn't identify any specific possible offense.

The takeover of Credit Suisse — which is set to host its annual shareholder meeting in a Zurich stadium Tuesday — has drawn both praise and criticism in the prosperous country of about 8.5 million people.

Before the bank marriage was orchestrated on March 19, Credit Suisse was hemorrhaging deposits, shareholders were dumping its stock and creditors were rushing to seek repayment.

The bank faced years of troubles that predated financial turmoil spurred by the collapse of two U.S. banks, ranging from losses on hedge fund bets to fines over failing to prevent money laundering by a Bulgarian drug ring and not reporting secret offshore accounts that wealthy Americans used to avoid paying taxes.",['Ap Finance'],

But European bank stocks and the wider market gained as investors watch whether moves to shore up banks will stem further upheaval in the global banking system.

Shares of Credit Suisse, whose woes stem from questions over its internal controls, fell 60% a day after UBS said it would buy the fellow Swiss bank for a lowball price of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion). Credit Suisse stocks were down 53%, trading at 93 cents a share as of 11:08 a.m. Eastern time.

Swiss regulators orchestrated the purchase in a bid to stop more turmoil after the collapse of two U.S. banks. In an indication of the frantic, behind-the-scenes deal-making by Swiss authorities to resolve the issue before markets opened, the acquisition was announced late Sunday.

There is still uncertainty over how the deal will play out for the combined bank. Analysts say some previous forced bank mergers didn't work out well for shareholders in the long run.

""Only time will tell how this shotgun wedding is received,"" said Neil Shearing, group chief economist for Capital Economics.

""While the deal may not be perfect, it takes care of a situation that has been plagued by rumor, scandal and a series of seemingly non-stop problems within Credit Suisse,"" Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial said in an email.

UBS shares initially fell on the Swiss stock exchange but had gained more than 6% in afternoon trading. The deal added volatility to other European bank stocks, which fell in early trading even as benchmark indexes climbed, before some clawed back their losses. Germany's Deutsche Bank, France's BNP Paribas and Italy's UniCredit were up, while London-based Barclays sank 3%.

Takeover by UBS

Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after a central bank plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) last week failed to reassure investors and customers. Shares of Credit Suisse and other banks had tumbled last week after the failure of two banks in the U.S. raised questions about other potentially weak global financial institutions.

Many of Credit Suisse's problems were unique and unlike the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S. It has faced an array of troubles in recent years, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.

Analysts and financial leaders say safeguards are stronger since the 2008 global financial crisis and that banks worldwide have plenty of available cash and support from central banks. But concerns about risks to the deal, losses for some investors and Credit Suisse's falling market value could renew fears about the health of banks.

Tobias Straumann, an economic history professor at University of Zurich, said the merger was the right move because the U.S. bank collapses and the danger to Credit Suisse was ""an international banking crisis in the making.""

""Markets are very nervous, and I think an additional accident in Switzerland would have fueled a lot of problems,"" he said.

Now, the focus will be on whether problems emerge in other banks or parts of the financial system, Shearing said.

""Containing crises is a bit like a game of whack-a-mole — with new fires starting as existing ones are extinguished,"" Shearing said.

""Too big to fail"" bank

Credit Suisse is among 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities were worried about the fallout if it were to fail.

UBS is bigger but Credit Suisse wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. It has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich through its wealth management business, and is a major mergers and acquisitions adviser. However, Credit Suisse weathered the 2008 financial crisis without assistance, unlike UBS.

Switzerland's executive branch passed an emergency ordinance allowing the merger to go through without shareholder approval.

As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in higher-risk Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out, leaving investors with hefty losses. That has triggered concern about the market for those bonds and for other banks that hold them.

The combination of the two biggest and best-known Swiss banks, each with histories dating to the mid-19th century, strikes at Switzerland's reputation as a global financial center — putting it on the cusp of having a single national banking champion.

Collapse of two U.S. banks

The deal follows the collapse of two large U.S. banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent further panic.

In a bid to shore up the global financial system, the world's central banks announced coordinated moves to stabilize banks, including access to a lending facility for banks to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice widely used during the 2008 crisis.

UBS officials said they plan to sell off parts of Credit Suisse or reduce the bank's size.

To support the deal, the Swiss central bank is providing a loan of up to 100 billion francs and the government is providing another 100 billion francs of support as a backstop if needed.

As the market tries to figure out what comes next after the merger, Straumann, the professor, said he wouldn't be surprised to see problems for regional banks in Europe after further interest rate increases, much like what happened to midsized banks in U.S.

""The banking system of Europe has not fully recovered from the crisis"" in 2008, he said. ""It's better, of course, than it used to be, but it's vulnerable.""",[],

The Financial Times reported that UBS has agreed to buy the bank for more than $2 billion, marking a substantial increase from the initial $1 billion offer the FT reported earlier Sunday. Faber said the price of the deal increased throughout the day's negotiations.

The Swiss government is holding a news conference to address the deal at 2:30 p.m. ET. Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment on the reports when contacted by CNBC.

Credit Suisse reportedly balked at UBS' initial offer, arguing it was too low and would hurt shareholders and employees, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg.

Swiss authorities have also reportedly been considering full or partial nationalization of the bank as an alternative to the UBS takeover, according to a Sunday Bloomberg report.

The UBS deal is being orchestrated quickly, so the Swiss are preparing for the case that it falls through, Bloomberg said, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The country is reportedly considering whether it would take over the bank completely or hold a significant equity stake.

The UBS offer comes after Credit Suisse shares logged their worst weekly decline since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, despite an announcement that it would access a loan of up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the Swiss central bank.

It had already been battling a string of losses and scandals, and last week sentiment was rocked again with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the shuttering of Signature Bank in the U.S., sending shares sliding.

Credit Suisse's scale and potential impact on the global economy is much greater than the U.S. banks. The Swiss bank's balance sheet is around twice the size of Lehman Brothers when it collapsed, at around 530 billion Swiss francs as of end-2022. It is also far more globally inter-connected, with multiple international subsidiaries — making an orderly management of Credit Suisse's situation even more important.

Credit Suisse lost around 38% of its deposits in the fourth quarter of 2022, and revealed in its delayed annual report early last week that outflows have still yet to reverse. It reported a full-year net loss of 7.3 billion Swiss francs for 2022 and expects a further ""substantial"" loss in 2023.

The bank had previously announced a massive strategic overhaul in a bid to address these chronic issues, with current CEO and Credit Suisse veteran Ulrich Koerner taking over in July.

https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2023/04/credit-suisse-jobs-asia,Credit Suisse bankers fear APAC cull,"If Credit Suisse bankers working in investment banking and capital markets in the APAC region were worried about their futures under Michael Klein, their prospects have darkened now that they'll be part of UBS.

UBS talked up the importance of Credit Suisse’s business in South-East Asia when the deal was announced, and sources say it will look to keep firm’s private bank and wealth management operations. But the outlook for the investment banking and capital markets (IBCM) business is bleak, according to multiple sources. “UBS don’t need many of their bankers in the region,” said one source. “There’s significant overlap in China and North Asia. There may be a handful they want in specific locations or product, but they probably don’t need 90% of those bankers.”

At the end of 2021, the last year that Credit Suisse operated a stand-alone Asia Pacific subsidiary, it employed 7,530 people across investment banking, asset management and wealth management. Sources say that it employs around 300 bankers in IBCM in the Asia-Pacific region. Credit Suisse’s Apac financing group has around 20 bankers, while it employs around 35 directors and managing directors across equity capital markets, mergers and acquisitions and corporate finance, according to one insider. It has around 30 bankers in its Singapore IBCM business.

UBS cannot start cutting jobs until the takeover completes, but some bankers are already voting with their feet and jumping before they are pushed. Lim Zi-Kuan, Credit Suisse’s head of M&A for Southeast Asia, resigned on April 3. “He was highly regarded and Credit Suisse wanted to keep him,” said one former colleague. Zi-Kuan has gone to Deutsche Bank,

Credit Suisse has a much bigger presence than UBS in APAC. While UBS may cherry-pick some bankers, it will want to control its cost base and chairman Colm Kelleher has pledged that the investment bank will consume no more than 25% of group risk-weighted assets. “We have a focused investment bank. It is highly competitive in the segments we have chosen to participate in and creates synergies with our other businesses. This has not changed with the acquisition of Credit Suisse,” he said at the bank’s AGM on April 5.

UBS is a rarity among western banks in China by having a profitable onshore business, but its success has come from being lean. Credit Suisse’s China investment banking joint venture employs around 40 people.

The outlook may be uncertain for Credit Suisse’s corporate financiers in APAC, but Kelleher restated his commitment to wealth management in the region as well as the US. “They are the largest and fastest growing regions in the world, and they have great demand for our world-class services rooted in Swiss expertise. The Credit Suisse transaction is expected to accelerate our strategic plans in this area,” he said at the AGM.

https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2023/03/ubs-credit-suisse-job-cuts,UBS's plan for Credit Suisse jobs,"UBS is acquiring Credit Suisse for CHF0.50 a share. Credit Suisse bankers and traders will still lose money on their deferred bonuses, but those losses will be limited to around CHF300m instead of the CHF600m they would have foregone at the initial offer of CHF0.25 a share. Good news!

The real question now though is what happens to Credit Suisse jobs, particularly at the investment bank. And, most particularly, what happens to Michael Klein's plan to spin out most of the investment bank in the form of Credit Suisse First Boston?

Credit Suisse bankers in the dark about their jobs

Senior insiders at Credit Suisse say they've had no news beyond an email which suggests the UBS deal won't close until next year. ""The implication is that it's business as usual for the next few months, although no one really knows what's going on,"" one Credit Suisse managing director tells us.

Credit Suisse's press release relating to the merger confirms that the deal is not expected to close until the end of 2023, and states that, ""until consummation of the merger, Credit Suisse will continue to conduct its business in the ordinary course and implement its restructuring measures in collaboration with UBS."" The release adds that,""UBS has expressed its confidence that the employment of the staff of Credit Suisse will be continued."" However, it also says that ""UBS is expected to appoint key personnel to Credit Suisse as soon as legally possible,"" which doesn't sound promising for senior UBS bankers.

UBS's communications on Credit Suisse jobs are more revelatory. Credit Suisse employees are being welcomed, but not universally.

UBS to Credit Suisse employees: Welcome, but there will be job cuts

""We understand that this is not an easy situation for Credit Suisse employees, but we would like to stress that we look forward to welcoming our new employees,"" said UBS chairman Colm Kelleher, speaking on today's analyst call.

UBS's broad plans for Credit Suisse's investment bank were explained in a presentation. Most notably, elements of Credit Suisse's investment bank are to be moved into a non-core unit, which UBS CFO Sarah Youngwood said will have a parameter ""broader"" than Credit Suisse's current non-core unit. UBS's press release states that the ""majority of Credit Suisse markets positions [will be] moved to non-core,"" which seems ominous for Credit Suisse salespeople and traders.

What happens to CS First Boston and to Credit Suisse' investment bankers?

What about CS First Boston? UBS CEO Ralph Hamers declined to comment on whether Michael Klein's plan for spinning out a ""super boutique"" is still viable. However, reading between the lines of statements made by UBS today, it sounds like something is taking shape in the shadows.

UBS says it sees the acquisition of Credit Suisse's investment bank as fulfilling some of its strategic goals. In particular, Credit Suisse brings a suite of investment bankers in the US and in technology, where UBS says it planned to expand anyway. ""On the global banking side, we see value in the combined entity,"" declared Hamers today. ""They provide some capabilities that are supportive to us.""

The implication is that Michael Klein and Credit Suisse's US bankers will be incorporated into UBS. Credit Suisse's European bankers may not be.

An additional CHF8bn of cost cuts, the investment bank to account for no more than 25% of RWA

UBS also plans to cut CHF8bn of cuts from the entire combined entity following the merger. Youngwood said today that these costs will come in addition to Credit Suisse's existing cost-cutting plans and that the bulk of the cost savings will come from Credit Suisse.

Many of the cuts are likely to come from the investment bank. ""The real challenge is the run down of the investment banking activities,” said Hamers of the acquisition, adding that the intention is to ""refocus the investment bank"" and that this ""will be quite some work.” Up to CHF6bn of the CHF8bn of cuts are reportedly coming from headcount spending.

UBS intends that the investment bank (excluding the non-core business) should account for no more than 25% of risk weighted assets at the combined entity following the merger.

What happens to Credit Suisse wealth management jobs in Asia?

Credit Suisse's Asian jobs may also be comparatively protected during the merger. UBS said today that there are synergies between the two banks' operations in the region. ""What Credit Suisse brings on the wealth side is quite complimentary to our strengths,"" said the bank. “Our strength in Hong Kong, Singapore and China that will now be complemented by Credit Suisse’s strength in South East Asia.”

The current chaos is less about contagion from that one firm’s collapse and more about embedded losses hiding in banks’ balance sheets. One study says that as many as 190 more lenders could fail.

First Republic, which has drawn potential suitors like Morgan Stanley, should sell itself or raise more capital quickly, after a $30 billion cash injection by bigger banks failed to assure markets. But its management still thinks it is worth more than the market does, while buyers believe they could get it for even less.

A similar story is playing out at other regional banks under pressure on the West Coast, including PacWest. And some would-be buyers think that if they wait long enough, they might be able to get financial help from the U.S. government, or at least some guarantees around legal liabilities. (The government has already taken a $2.5 billion hit from the sale of Signature to New York Community Bancorp.) But it’s unclear what the government can offer, since many of the powers it drew upon in 2008 were removed by the Dodd-Frank overhaul of banking rules.

The one good piece of news is that it appears, at least anecdotally, that the run on uninsured deposits from many of the regional banks has stopped, or at least slowed. (Customers have reportedly pulled $70 billion from First Republic.) If true, it would behoove the banks to come out publicly and describe their deposit position in detail. That might help start to restore confidence in a sector badly in need of it.

“The liquidity guarantees ensure that for the next few years UBS is immune to bank runs. There is now only one large Swiss Bank – and the large share of domestic business should ensure profitability. We have purchased a long position in UBS, a rare new long for our fund,” it said.

“Credit Suisse remains overstaffed with over-paid and risk-loving staff. We hope and expect UBS will fire many of them,” the fund manager said. “If they don’t, our UBS stock position probably won’t work that well.

“The loans may be bad. But if Silicon Valley Bank was anything like as good as our preconceptions, then First Citizens is a very cheap stock indeed,” Bronte said.

Bronte closed its short position in Credit Suisse before its collapse.

“While we were short due to Greensill exposure, we made money on the short due to another ‘accident’ at Credit Suisse that was exposed roughly simultaneously: large losses on margin loans to Archegos, an insanely aggressive family office,” Bronte explained.

“We covered. We shouldn’t have. We understood just how much dross was in the bank. But we made money accidentally (on the Archegos incident about which we knew nothing) and when we make money fortuitously, we like to take unearned profit – but not undue credit – for our luck.

LONDON/ZURICH, March 20 (Reuters) - Shares in UBS (UBSG.S) plunged on Monday, heading for their biggest one-day fall since 2008 after its weekend rescue of ailing rival Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) ignited concerns among investors about the long-term benefits of the deal.

UBS, with a hefty backstop from Swiss authorities, agreed to buy Credit Suisse on Sunday for just a fraction of its market value in a package orchestrated by Swiss regulators.

The bank will pay 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.23 billion) for Credit Suisse and assume up to $5.4 billion in losses.

Shares in UBS fell by as much as 16% in early trading, the most since September 2008. They were last down 15% at 14.47 francs. Since the start of March alone, they've lost almost 30% in value, set for their largest monthly loss since September 1998.

Johann Scholtz, analyst at Morningstar, said the acquisition should ultimately benefit UBS.

""A week can be a very long time in financial markets. UBS acquiring Credit Suisse for 3 billion francs a week ago would have seemed like a terrific deal. Now the position is less clear,"" he said.

""Credit Suisse likely experienced significant net outflows of client assets last week, eroding its revenue base. We, however, believe that UBS can extract value from the acquisition. It is in a much better position to execute a radical restructuring of Credit Suisse's business than Credit Suisse was,"" Scholtz added.

Credit Suisse shares slid by more than 60% to around 0.69 Swiss francs ($0.7417), while the value of its additional tier 1 (AT1) bonds - a type of bond issued by banks that make up the capital buffers regulators require them to hold - dropped as low as 1 cent on the dollar.

The Swiss regulator demanded Credit Suisse write down 16 billion Swiss francs worth of the debt to zero as part of the merger deal, angering bondholders.

A $1 billion AT1 bond with a coupon of 4.5% was bid as low as 1 cent on the dollar, Tradeweb pricing showed.

""The next few hours of trading will give us a better picture on whether the crisis is contained,"" Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said.

""In theory, there is no reason for the Credit Suisse crisis to extend, as what triggered the last quake for Credit Suisse was a confidence crisis – which doesn't concern UBS - a bank outside of the turmoil, with, in addition, ample liquidity and guarantee from the SNB (Swiss National Bank) and the government.""

At Friday's close, Credit Suisse had a total market value of $8 billion. Just six months ago, it was worth $13 billion.

JPMorgan said that although UBS stood to gain in the longer-term from the deal, the writedown of the AT1 bonds would impact other European banks.

""We believe this AT1 write-down by a systemically important bank will have negative implications for the wider European Banks’ AT1 market as well as overall funding profile and Cost of Equity for the Banks,"" JPMorgan strategists Kian Abouhossein and Amit Ranjan said in a note on Monday.

An index of European banking shares (.SX7P) tanked on Monday, losing more than 4% as shares in the likes of Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Commerzbank (CBKG.DE), Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) and BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) dropped between 5.5-7.5%.

Credit Suisse, the battered Swiss bank, has agreed to an emergency takeover by its rival UBS, Switzerland’s largest bank, a move engineered by the Swiss government to stave off immediate concerns of a global financial crisis. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The hasty deal, which was announced Sunday following a weekend of negotiations, offers a temporary reprieve after days of panic in global markets triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. But it does little to ease longer-term worries of instability in the banking system.

A “swift and stabilizing solution was absolutely necessary,” Alain Berset, president of the Swiss Confederation, said during a Sunday afternoon news conference. The UBS deal, he added, was “the best solution for restoring the confidence that has been lacking in financial markets recently.”

Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell said in a joint statement Sunday afternoon that they “welcome” the announcement.

“The capital and liquidity positions of the U.S. banking system are strong, and the U.S. financial system is resilient,” they wrote. “We have been in close contact with our international counterparts to support their implementation.”

But many banking experts remain doubtful that the banking turmoil is over.

""The forced merger of UBS and Credit Suisse ends one potentially systemic problem, but this is far from over,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the consulting firm RSM. “Now the question is: What other banks are at risk and what is the nature of that risk? This is the start of a multi-month adjustment.”

UBS is paying 3 billion Swiss francs, or $3.3 billion, for Credit Suisse in an all-stock deal, which is well under the bank’s market value of $8 billion as of Friday. The Swiss National Bank said it would lend up to 100 billion Swiss francs, or about $108 billion, to help facilitate the takeover.

In addition, Swiss authorities are planning to speed up the process by circumventing laws that would require a shareholder vote, UBS executives said Sunday.

The Credit Suisse announcement coincided with a coordinated move by central banks to ease strains in dollar funding markets and signal confidence in the global system. The Fed, Bank of Canada, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank said they would expand the frequency of dollar swap line operations, moving from weekly to daily, starting Monday.

The template has been used before in 2008 and 2020 to ease market uncertainty and stave off broader panic. The goal is to ensure that central banks can hold on to easy access to dollar funding, which can dry up when the market is under strain.

“The action today made sure that any dollar funding pressure [is] quashed to ensure payments clear,” Brusuelas said. “It’s preventive action to make sure the plumbing of the global financial architecture keeps flowing.”

The moves over the weekend are expected to tee up another bumpy week. The Fed is set to convene Tuesday and Wednesday for its March policy meeting, where policymakers will craft a fresh set of economic projections. They are expected to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point at the conclusion of the two-day meeting. But they will eventually pause rate increases to limit any hazardous consequences of the Fed’s aggressive campaign to fight inflation.

Just two weeks ago, some Fed watchers speculated that the central bank might go with half a percentage point, fearing the economy was showing signs of heating back up. But that possibility vanished within days as concerns grew that the repercussions of the Fed’s inflation fight might disrupt the nation’s own financial stability.

Credit Suisse woes

The takeover of Credit Suisse caps more than a week of speculation over the Swiss giant’s fate amid growing fears of a global financial crisis after two U.S. regional banks, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank of New York, failed this month. Although U.S. regulators have taken sweeping steps, including backstopping deposits, those measures have not done enough to assuage fears of a cascading banking crisis.

Those concerns went global in recent days, after Credit Suisse warned of “material weaknesses” in its financial reporting. On Thursday, the bank received $53.7 billion in emergency funds from Switzerland’s central bank, but it wasn’t enough to restore confidence in the bank’s viability. Shares of Credit Suisse have tumbled more than 20 percent in the past week, and more than 75 percent from a year ago.

Credit Suisse’s downfall stemmed from years of poor decisions and scandals. A long stretch of mismanagement, compliance issues and a critical data breach contributed to the trouble, including roughly $8 billion in losses last year alone.

Then, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank this month set off widespread alarm in the banking system, which helped sink Credit Suisse’s stock price by 14 percent in one day.

“Credit Suisse was already on shaky ground,” said John Sedunov, a finance professor at Villanova University. “There was a confluence of factors, a confluence of missteps along the way that got us here. But most recently, people started to panic. They looked for weak spots, and Credit Suisse happened to be a big one.”

The banking behemoth’s mounting problems, he said, were “a much bigger deal globally” than SVB’s collapse. Letting Credit Suisse fail would have been catastrophic to the European banking system and undermined Switzerland’s standing as a global financial center.

“The Swiss government had too much to lose to let this fail,” Sedunov said. “This deal was done in-house, with a white knight from within. It was very important for Switzerland that this stayed within borders for them.”

But the merger of two major financial institutions is likely to bring its own set of challenges. UBS plans to slash Credit Suisse’s investment banking arm in hopes of bringing it in line with a more “conservative risk culture,” UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said during a news conference Sunday.

Analysts noted that the “shotgun wedding” between UBS and Credit Suisse provides immediate financial stability but raises worrisome questions about the next domino that could fall.

“The [Credit Suisse] drama now shifts from negotiation risk to execution risk, which the Swiss authorities are moving aggressively to manage down, but is not zero,” Evercore ISI’s Krishna Guha and Peter Williams wrote in an analyst note on Sunday. “Market focus will likely broaden out to other weaker European banks as well as U.S. regional banks.”

Eyes on the Fed

The past week has also raised new questions on what it will take to avert another international crisis, and who is to blame for the damage already done. The Wall Street Journal and New York Times reported over the weekend that the Fed’s warnings about Silicon Valley Bank stretched back more than a year, but those ultimately fell short.

The Fed is investigating the glaring gap in oversight, with the probe headed by Michael S. Barr, the Fed’s chief banking cop. Those results are expected to be made public by May 1.

Lawmakers are also increasing their scrutiny. On Sunday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called on Congress to lift the federal insurance cap for bank deposits above $250,000, one week after the Biden administration announced it would protect all depositors at Silicon Valley Bank, regardless of how much money they had in the failing institution. Warren, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee and is a commercial and bankruptcy law expert, suggested raising that figure to anywhere from $2 million to $10 million during an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

She also urged lawmakers to repeal a provision of the 2018 law that had loosened restrictions on banks with $50 billion or more in assets, saying the latest tumult in the financial system underscored her belief that the Fed has fallen short in its core duties. Calling for an end to rate increases, she said higher borrowing costs don’t do anything to solve the economy’s root problems and risk putting people out of work in the meantime.

UBS (ticker: UBS) bought Credit Suisse (CS) for about $3 billion in shares in a deal brokered by regulators. Moody’s made the change on concern that Credit Suisse weaker credit profile and the cost of integrating it into UBS would make it harder to hit financial targets.



Moody’s said the deal nevertheless “has the potential, in due course, to significantly enhance UBS’s franchise in wealth management, Swiss banking, asset management and to a lesser degree in investment banking, whilst targeting a reduction of operating costs by more than $8 billion.”",['Brian Swint'],

https://fortune.com/2023/03/22/pimco-america-investment-manager-lost-340-million-surprise-credit-suisse-bond-write-off/,Credit Suisse UBS takeover: PIMCO reportedly loses $340m in bonds,"In the pecking order of who gets paid first when a bank collapses, shareholders don’t usually sit very high up the chain.

But in an unusual turn of events, those who held shares in Credit Suisse have actually got a payout—in the billions—ahead of those who held bonds in the bank.

That has meant an economic hit to Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO)—one of America’s largest investment managers. PIMCO lost $340 million when a category of bonds were wiped out on Sunday in UBS’s takeover of the bank, sources told Reuters.

The bonds were wiped out on Sunday, with PIMCO’s total loss estimate based on the trading value the bonds had before the weekend.

California-based PIMCO lost out on a specific type of bond, an Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bond. Swiss regulators made the decision on Sunday to wipe out $17 billion-worth of AT1 debt in order to allow the Credit Suisse and UBS merger to go through.

Usually, bondholders rank above shareholders when a bank goes bust. However, under the bond stipulations in Switzerland, financial watchdogs are under no pressure to stick to the normal capital structure.

As a result, shareholders, who would usually be among the biggest losers, will at least see some return from UBS’s takeover price of 0.76 Swiss francs ($0.8191) per share—the equivalent of $3.23 billion, a far cry from the $8 billion the bank was worth Friday, but more than the $0 they might have received otherwise.

Surprise and legal action

Companies like PIMCO who purchased the risky bank bonds shouldn’t have been surprised by the move, according to one bank adviser and bond investor who told Reuters that the Swiss authorities’ action is completely legal given the fine print on Credit Suisse’s AT1 bonds. This stipulated that the bonds could be subject to a complete write down.

Unsurprisingly, the revelation has prompted AT1 bondholders in other banks to spook, with the price of bonds dropping as investors try to evaluate the level of risk. One bond trader told Investing.com that the regulators’ move at Credit Suisse had set a precedent that means the bonds are now more exposed to wider economic factors, adding: “And economic risks are really hard to understand and price.”

PIMCO’s total exposure in the Credit Suisse collapse now stands at around $4 billion, the source added.

The investment manager—which manages about $1.74 trillion in assets—isn’t alone. According to Morningstar data seen by Reuters, Paris-based Lazard Freres Gestion had 7.4% of a €1.45 billion fund in AT1 bonds, worth around $107.3 million.

Likewise Reuters said asset manager GAM had 4.81% of its €1.15 billion fund in AT1 bonds.

A number of bondholders—who have not been named—are now reportedly considering legal action, according to law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan.

PIMCO can’t be too down-hearted about their losses however, as the source added that the asset write-off had been more than covered by gains in PIMCO’s other Credit Suisse bond holdings following the UBS takeover.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ubs-purchase-credit-suisse-fallout-silicon-valley-bank/,UBS to purchase Credit Suisse amid fallout from U.S. bank collapses,"The banking giant UBS has agreed to purchase Credit Suisse, a smaller rival, Swiss authorities announced on Sunday. The historic deal comes as major financial institutions continue to grapple with the fallout from the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this month, and work to stave off a broader crisis.

""This takeover was made possible with the support of the Swiss federal government, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA and the Swiss National Bank,"" the Swiss National Bank said in a statement. ""With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation.""

UBS will buy Credit Suisse for more than $3 billion, Credit Suisse said in a news release detailing the purchase, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. All of the bank's current shareholders will receive one share of UBS for around 22 1/2 shares of Credit Suisse, according to the release.

In a statement, Axel P. Lehmann, the chairman of Credit Suisse's board of directors, said ""the announced merger represents the best available outcome,"" citing ""recent extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances.""

""This has been an extremely challenging time for Credit Suisse and while the team has worked tirelessly to address many significant legacy issues and execute on its new strategy, we are forced to reach a solution today that provides a durable outcome,"" Lehmann's added.

At a news conference held Sunday afternoon to discuss the emergency purchase, Karin Keller-Sutter, president of FINMA, said ""Switzerland has to take responsibilities beyond its own borders,"" and added that the deal was reached in an effort to avoid ""irreparable economic turmoil in Switzerland and throughout the world."" Keller-Sutter said the purchase ""laid the foundations for greater stability both in Switzerland and internationally.""

Fears about the stability of the global banking system spread across the U.S. and Europe in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank's failures, which happened less than two weeks ago ago and within days of each other. Their closures prompted rare moves by the federal government as well as some of the largest U.S. banks to shore up finances at institutions that became threatened in the turmoil.

Credit Suisse received almost $54 billion last week from the Swiss national bank as part of those negotiations, while a consortium of 11 massive U.S. banks, including Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, agreed to provide $30 billion in funding for First Republic Bank. Those four banks each agreed to contribute $5 billion, while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley each agreed to give $2.5 billion and BNY Mellon, PNC Bank, State Street, Truist and U.S. Bank each agreed to give $1 billion.

The pledges of emergency funding on Thursday briefly interrupted what had been ongoing downturns in both banks' stocks, which resumed the following day. On Friday, Credit Suisse's share price slipped 7% and ended the day at $2.01.

For Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second-largest commercial bank, shares dropped 30% on the SIX stock exchange after its largest shareholder said it would not put any more money into the institution. The bank had faced problems before the U.S. banks' failures gave rise to fear and a lack of confidence among big investors, and it announced its plans to borrow up to 50 billion francs from the national bank on Thursday.

""This additional liquidity would support Credit Suisse's core businesses and clients as Credit Suisse takes the necessary steps to create a simpler and more focused bank built around client needs,"" said Credit Suisse in a statement at the time.

The steep drop-off in its share prices one day earlier marked a record-low for Credit Suisse, after the Saudi National Bank told news outlets that it would not inject additional funds into the institution as it sought to avoid regulations that would become applicable with a stake in the Swiss lender above 10%. That upheaval caused an automatic freeze in trading of shares of Credit Suisse on the Swiss market and significantly impacted shares of other large European banks, with some share prices falling by double-digits.

Despite the Swiss national bank's move to shore up finances at Credit Suisse, analysts at Capital Economics said concerns remained about the health of the institution, especially since it has not been profitable in two years.

Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in an investor note on Friday that, while Credit Suisse has a plan to restore business over the course of three years, ""it is uncertain whether markets will give it that long.""",['Emily Mae Czachor'],

March 17 (Reuters) - Banking giant UBS (UBSG.S) is in discussions to take over all or parts of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), with the boards of Switzerland's two biggest lenders set to meet separately over the weekend, the Financial Times reported on Friday.

The Swiss National Bank and regulator FINMA are organising the talks in an attempt to build confidence in the country's banking sector, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

On Friday evening, Swiss regulators informed their counterparts in the United States and United Kingdom that the merger of the two banks was their ""Plan A"" to salvage the confidence in Credit Suisse, the report added.

Several other options are also under discussion between the two banks as both sides try to evaluate regulatory constraints in different jurisdictions, the newspaper reported.

The Swiss central bank's focus is on agreeing a straightforward solution before markets open on Monday, the report said, adding there is no guarantee a deal will be reached.

Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment on the report. The Swiss National Bank and FINMA did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.

Bloomberg reported on Thursday that UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse were opposed to a forced merger, with UBS preferring to focus on its own wealth-centric strategy and reluctant to take on risks related to its smaller rival.

Credit Suisse is biggest bank to be ensnared in the market turmoil following the collapse of U.S. lenders SVB and New York-based Signature Bank, forcing the Swiss lender to borrow up to $54 billion from Switzerland's central bank to shore up liquidity.

https://www.tipranks.com/news/ubs-nyseubs-initiates-efforts-to-reorganize-credit-suisses-operations,UBS (NYSE:UBS) Takes First Steps to Integrate Credit Suisse,"UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS), a multinational investment bank, has another task to complete following its agreement to take over the failing bank Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS). UBS will meet with Michael Klein and end the First Boston deal agreed upon between Credit Suisse and Klein in October 2022.

As per the terms of the deal, Klein would end up having a major say in the functioning of CS’ investment bank. UBS will have to negotiate a favorable breakup fee owed to Klein in the event of contract termination.

Credit Suisse has had its fair share of trouble in the past couple of months, both related to its business and umpteen controversies. In one effort, CS made a pact with Klein, one of its old board members, to merge his boutique advisory firm with CS’ advisory and capital markets unit. The two units were to spin off and pursue a listing under the First Boston name. In exchange, Klein was to advise CS’ on restructuring its investment bank.

No doubt, UBS has a challenging task ahead with its takeover of Credit Suisse. UBS has to streamline operations at CS, merge complementary parts, and let go of redundant operations and staff at the failed bank. CS’ investment bank does intrigue UBS, and it wants to retain those parts, which management thinks can add substantial business and value to UBS.

What is the UBS Stock Prediction?

Since announcing the deal to buy out Credit Suisse, UBS stock has gained 11.9%. There may be a few hiccups along the way, but the outcome of the takeover will likely benefit UBS.

Further, Wall Street analysts remain bullish about UBS’s stock trajectory after the announcement. On TipRanks, UBS has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on seven Buys and one Hold rating. Also, the average UBS Group AG stock prediction of $26.38 implies 25.3% upside potential from current levels.

UBS has struck a deal to purchase troubled Credit Suisse for $3.2 billion, as bank solvency fears continue to batter global markets.

Why it matters: Aggressive central bank action to arrest stubborn inflation has shaken investor confidence, with financial institutions caught in the crosshairs.

The details: Under the terms of the all-share transaction, Credit Suisse shareholders will receive 1 UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares, for a total consideration of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion). The deal is expected to be finalized by year-end.

UBS offer represents a fraction of the bank's roughly $8.5 billion market capitalization as of Friday's close.

The Swiss National Bank agreed to lend up to 100 billion francs to UBS to support the transaction.

Finma, the Swiss financial regulator, took the extraordinary step of enforcing that $17 billion worth of higher-risk Credit Suisse’s bonds would be wiped out. The regulator also eliminated the need for shareholders to vote on the deal.

Flashback: After years of mismanagement and scandal-ridden headlines, the storied 167-year-old European banking giant was laid low by a crisis rattling the banking sector in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's failure.

Credit Suisse, one of a handful of global financial institutions deemed ""systemically important,"" posted a fourth-quarter loss of over $1 billion. Over the last few days, it has suffered mass outflows as problems mounted and bank sector concerns festered, pushing its stock to record lows.

What they're saying: “Given recent extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances, the announced merger represents the best available outcome,"" Axel P. Lehmann, Credit Suisse's chairman said in a statement.

""This has been an extremely challenging time for Credit Suisse and while the team has worked tirelessly to address many significant legacy issues and execute on its new strategy, we are forced to reach a solution today that provides a durable outcome,"" he added.

March 18 (Reuters) - UBS AG (UBSG.S) is asking the Swiss government to cover about $6 billion in costs if it were to buy Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), a person with knowledge of the talks said, as the two sides raced to hammer together a deal to restore confidence in the ailing Swiss bank.

The 167-year-old Credit Suisse is the biggest name ensnared in the turmoil unleashed by the collapse of U.S. lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank over the past week, spurring a rout in banking stocks and prompting authorities to rush out extraordinary measures to keep banks afloat.

The $6 billion in government guarantees UBS is seeking would cover the cost of winding down parts of Credit Suisse and potential litigation charges, two people told Reuters.

One of the sources cautioned that the talks to resolve the crisis of confidence in Credit Suisse are encountering significant obstacles, and 10,000 jobs may have to be cut if the two banks combine.

Swiss regulators are racing to present a solution for Credit Suisse before markets reopen on Monday, but the complexities of combining two behemoths raises the prospect that talks will last well into Sunday, said the person, who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the situation.

Credit Suisse, UBS and the Swiss government declined to comment.

The frenzied weekend negotiations come after a brutal week for banking stocks and efforts in Europe and the U.S. to shore up the sector. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration moved to backstop consumer deposits while the Swiss central bank lent billions to Credit Suisse to stabilize its shaky balance sheet.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (BRKa.N) Warren Buffett has held discussions with senior Biden administration officials about the banking crisis, a source told Reuters.

The White House and U.S. Treasury declined to comment. Bloomberg News reported earlier that Buffett had been in touch with the administration in recent days about the regional banking crisis, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday. The source declined to elaborate on the details of the discussions.

UBS was under pressure from the Swiss authorities to carry out a takeover of its local rival to get the crisis under control, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The plan could see Credit Suisse's Swiss business spun off.

Switzerland is preparing to use emergency measures to fast-track the deal, the Financial Times reported, citing two people familiar with the situation.

U.S. authorities are involved, working with their Swiss counterparts to help broker a deal, Bloomberg News reported, also citing those familiar with the matter.

British finance minister Jeremy Hunt and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey are also in regular contact this weekend over the fate of Credit Suisse, a source familiar with the matter said. Spokespeople for the British Treasury and the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority, which oversees lenders, declined to comment.

FORCEFUL RESPONSE

Credit Suisse shares lost a quarter of their value in the last week. It was forced to tap $54 billion in central bank funding as it tries to recover from a string of scandals that have undermined the confidence of investors and clients.

The company ranks among the world's largest wealth managers and is considered one of 30 global, systemically important banks whose failure would ripple throughout the entire financial system.

The banking sector's fundamentals are stronger and the global systemic linkages are weaker than during the 2008 global financial crisis, Goldman analyst Lotfi Karoui wrote in a late Friday note to clients. That limits the risk of a ""potential vicious circle of counterparty credit losses,"" Karoui said.

""However, a more forceful policy response is likely needed to bring some stability,"" Karoui said. The bank said the lack of clarity on Credit Suisse's future will pressure the broader European banking sector.

A senior official at China's central bank said on Saturday that high interest rates in the major developed economies could continue to cause problems for the financial system.

There were multiple reports of interest for Credit Suisse from other rivals. Bloomberg reported that Deutsche Bank was looking at the possibility of buying some of its assets, while U.S. financial giant BlackRock (BLK.N) denied a report that it was participating in a rival bid for the bank.

Credit Suisse and First Republic Bank

INTEREST RATE RISK

The failure of California-based Silicon Valley Bank brought into focus how a relentless campaign of interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks - including the European Central Bank this week - was pressuring the banking sector. SVB and Signature's collapses are the second- and third-largest bank failures in U.S. history behind the demise of Washington Mutual during the global financial crisis in 2008.

Banking stocks globally have been battered since SVB collapsed, with the S&P Banks index (.SPXBK) falling 22%, its largest two weeks of losses since the pandemic shook markets in March 2020.

Big U.S. banks threw a $30 billion lifeline to smaller lender First Republic (FRC.N), and U.S. banks altogether have sought a record $153 billion in emergency liquidity from the Federal Reserve in recent days.

A coalition of midsize U.S. banks, Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America (MBCA), asked regulators to extend FDIC insurance to all deposits for the next two years, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday, citing an MBCA letter to regulators.

In Washington, focus has turned to greater oversight to ensure that banks and their executives are held accountable.

Biden called on Congress to give regulators greater power over the sector, including imposing higher fines, clawing back funds and barring officials from failed banks.

Top economy stories: US raises interest rates by 0.25 percentage points; UBS takes over Credit Suisse; IMF board approves Sri Lanka bailout.

1. US raises interest rates again as it weighs up banking crisis

The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point but indicated it is on the verge of pausing further increases. The small rise is an attempt to balance out inflation risks with the threat of banking-system instability and a potential credit crunch that could lead to a sharp economic slowdown.

The rate hike is the US central bank's ninth in a row and lifts its key interest rate to 4.75-5.00% – its highest level since 2007 and up from practically zero a year ago. But in a key shift driven by the sudden failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank this month, the Fed's latest policy statement no longer says that ""ongoing increases"" in rates will likely be appropriate.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell sought to reassure investors about the soundness of the banking system, saying that the management of SVB ""failed badly"" but that the bank's collapse this month does not indicate wider weaknesses in the banking system.

Ongoing inflation has led to nine consecutive rises in US interest rates. Image: US Bureau of Labor Statistics

However, Powell admitted that Fed officials still need to see how banks might change their lending behaviour in response to the SVB and Signature collapses. ""It's really ... a question of not knowing at this point,"" he said. ""How significant will this credit tightening be, and how sustainable?""

Reuters says that the Fed's relentless rate hikes to try and rein in inflation are among the factors being blamed for the biggest banking sector meltdown since the 2008 financial crisis. In February, US regulators said the country's banks had unrealized losses of more than $620 billion on securities, underscoring the hit from rising interest rates.

JPMorgan says the banking crisis and rising interest rates mean the US appears to be heading for a recession. “A soft landing now looks unlikely, with the airplane in a tailspin (lack of market confidence) and engines about to turn off (bank lending),” its strategists said in a note to clients. “Even if central bankers successfully contain the contagion, credit conditions look set to tighten more rapidly because of pressure from both markets and regulators.”



2. UBS takes over Credit Suisse as banks seek to stem crisis fears

Some of the world's largest central banks came together last weekend to stop a potential banking crisis from spreading, as Swiss authorities persuaded UBS to buy rival bank Credit Suisse in an historic deal.

UBS will buy Credit Suisse for CHF3 billion ($3.23 billion) in stock and assume up to CHF5 billion ($5.4 billion) in losses. Credit Suisse's share price slumped last week after its largest investor said it could not provide the bank with more money, prompting large falls in other banking stocks.

The Swiss National Bank's chairman says the UBS takeover prevented ""extreme consequences for Switzerland but also the global economy"". The European Central Bank (ECB) described the rescue deal as ""instrumental"" for restoring calm, and vowed to support Eurozone banks with loans if needed.

In a global response not seen since the height of the pandemic, the ECB also joined forces with the US Federal Reserve and central banks in Canada, England, Japan and Switzerland to bolster the flow of cash around. The banks will offer daily currency swaps – an expansion from a previous weekly programme – in what is effectively a low-risk short-term loan offering to ensure the world's major economies have adequate supply of US dollars to meet local demands.

However, the UBS takeover has not pleased distressed debt investors and corporate litigators in the US, who are preparing to fight the Swiss government over its move to write down $17bn of Credit Suisse bonds as part of the deal, The Financial Times reports.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) board has approved a nearly $3 billion bailout for Sri Lanka. The full programme will enable the country to access up to $7 billion in funding – but IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva says Sri Lanka needs to undertake various reforms in return.

Japan's core consumer inflation slowed in February, but an index stripping away energy costs hit a four-decade high, suggesting that cost-push pressures may persist longer than policy-makers thought. The core consumer price index rose by 3.1% last month from a year earlier, down from a 41-year high of 4.2% in January.



South Korea's exports plummeted by 17.4% in the first 20 days of March compared with a year earlier, with semiconductor shipments sliding by 44.7%, Bloomberg reports. The country is one of the world’s biggest exporters, and its economic health is a key indicator of trends in the global economy.

Germany's economy will shrink again in the first quarter and underlying inflation could prove to be stubborn, even if overall price growth is likely to slow sharply soon, the central bank says. This would put Europe's biggest economy into recession, after it contracted by 0.4% in the final quarter of 2022. Investor confidence in Germany has fallen for the first time in six months.

The World Economic Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network has built a global community of central banks, international organizations and leading blockchain experts to identify and leverage innovations in distributed ledger technologies (DLT) that could help usher in a new age for the global banking system. We are now helping central banks build, pilot and scale innovative policy frameworks for guiding the implementation of DLT, with a focus on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). DLT has widespread implications for the financial and monetary systems of tomorrow, but decisions about its use require input from multiple sectors in order to realize the technology’s full potential. “Over the next four years, we should expect to see many central banks decide whether they will use blockchain and distributed ledger technologies to improve their processes and economic welfare. Given the systemic importance of central bank processes, and the relative freshness of blockchain technology, banks must carefully consider all known and unknown risks to implementation.”

The Bank of England has raised interest rates by a further quarter of a percentage point following an unexpected rise in British inflation to 10.4% in February. Rates now stand at 4.25%, but the bank says its Monetary Policy Committee sees less urgency about maintaining its fast run of rate hikes, and that price growth is on course to fall sharply in April-June.

Nigeria's central bank is likely to extend its sharp monetary tightening as it looks to contain rising inflation, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. Annual inflation in Africa's biggest economy rose to 21.91% in February from 21.82% in January. The bank hiked its key interest rate to 17.5% in January, from 10.5% last May.

Lebanon's central bank will begin selling unlimited amounts of US dollars in a bid to halt the spiralling devaluation of the Lebanese pound. The currency has lost more than 98% of its value since the economy began unravelling in 2019.

GENEVA (AP) — The Swiss government says it’s ordered cuts to the bonuses of top executives of Credit Suisse, with nearly 1,000 managers being “deprived” of tens of millions combined as the troubled bank heads toward a forced merger with rival UBS .

The Federal Council, a seven-member panel that runs Switzerland’s executive branch, announced Wednesday that it has instructed the Finance Department to cancel altogether or reduce by either one-half or one-quarter such bonuses due last year among the top three rungs of management.

That will amount to a loss of bonus pay totaling about 50 million to 60 million Swiss francs ($55 million to $66 million).

The move comes after Swiss authorities scrambled in mid-March to cobble together a 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.25 billion) sale to UBS of Credit Suisse , which suffered surging outflows of deposits and a plunge in its share price.

Two days after the deal was announced, the government said it was temporarily suspending bonus payouts to Credit Suisse employees.

Bonuses for top Credit Suisse managers also are set to be canceled or reduced this year. UBS executives hope to close the takeover deal in the coming months.

The rescue capped years of trouble at Credit Suisse — among 30 banks worldwide considered “systemically important” — after fears that it could fail and trigger an international financial crisis after the collapse of two U.S. banks.

In an indication of why not all bank employees were affected by the bonus changes, the Swiss executive branch said total deferred variable compensation, such as share awards, of Credit Suisse’s 49,000 employees has sunk to 635 million francs ($700 million) — to about one-fourth of their total worth when initially awarded.

“In other words, all employees have already had to bear a total loss of more than 2 billion francs due to the drop in Credit Suisse’s share price,” it said.

The announcement comes a day after shareholders criticized Credit Suisse leaders , who apologized for failures of the 167-year-old lender.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Switzerland’s biggest bank invited holders of $3 billion of its senior bonds to sell them back after acquisition in an effort to calm concerns over the risks of the deal. While shareholders have cheered UBS picking up its rival at a very cheap price, its bond prices have dropped in recent days and credit ratings companies have lowered their outlook on the bank’s debt.

UBS, which had seen its stock rise the past two years on the pitch of stability, has signed up for years of a complicated integration effort and restructuring to cut at least $8 billion of costs. But the Swiss firm is betting the payoff will be worth it to add to its profitable wealth business, and it has 56 billion francs of badwill and a government guarantee on some losses to protect its downside.

The decision was a “reasonable action to give investors the option to sell back the bonds should they, having known what they know now, have chosen not to invest,” said Andrew Wong, a credit analyst at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.

UBS made the buyback offer to holders of its senior unsecured notes due in March 2028 and March 2032, totaling 2.75 billion euros ($3 billion), to tender the securities for cash at their respective re-offer price, citing the “exceptional corporate actions” of March 19. That was the day UBS agreed to buy its rival in a government-brokered deal aimed at containing a financial market selloff sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this month.

Story continues

The bank’s senior, euro-denominated bonds rose after the offer. While shares dropped 2% on Wednesday, its 11% jump since the deal was announced is one of the biggest rises this week among European banks.

UBS’s credit risk has been jolted since concern over Credit Suisse’s fate, and the role UBS would play in it, roiled global markets. After a deal was announced over the weekend, the cost of insuring UBS’s debt for one year soared to a record. But also, the credit default swaps for the holding company rose above those for its operating company, UBS AG, by the most on record.

“UBS Group is the entity that is taking over the risk from the Credit Suisse acquisition, while its operating company should remain better protected,” Suvi Platerink Kosonen, a banking credit analyst with ING Groep NV, said on Tuesday. “From that angle it makes sense that the spreads of the group will widen and underperform against the OpCo.”

S&P Global Inc. revised its outlook on its A- rating on UBS Group to negative on execution risk from the acquisition, but maintained a stable outlook on the operating company.

The two securities are UBS V4.625% 03/17/28 and UBS V4.75% 03/17/32

The buyback offer opens on March 22, with the early expiration deadline on March 28 and the final expiration deadline on April 4

“The issuer has decided to launch this exercise as a result of a prudent assessment of these recent developments and the Issuer’s long-term commitment to its credit investors,” UBS said in statement. A bank spokesman declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg

The bonds were priced in the public market on March 9 and were settled on March 17. There’s typically a period of gray market trading between a bond’s pricing and settlement

The two so-called bail-in bonds were priced on March 9, just as the first signs of trouble emerged at SVB Financial Group. The 2032 note was indicated at a price of 99.00 cents at 12:30pm in London on Wednesday, below its re-offer price of 99.518 cents, according to pricing compiled by Bloomberg. The 2028 debt was indicated at 99.67 cents with a re-offer price of 99.932 cents.

These securities are risky, but they’re still safer than Additional Tier 1 notes, which are the most junior bonds in a bank’s debt pile.

“It seems fair and reasonable to let investors think twice if they need to reconsider the risks, which is helpful in shoring up sentiment eventually if not immediately,” said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis SA.

Investment banking boss Dragi Ristevski, well-regarded as a financial sponsors and industrials banker, has jumped back to Macquarie Capital where he worked more than a decade ago. He will run financial sponsors coverage for the Asia Pacific, as revealed by Street Talk and formally announced on Wednesday morning.

Others have been lining up meetings with rivals, recruiters, clients and anywhere else they think they’ll be able to get a job. Because unfortunately for them, UBS is moving slowly and either disinterested or not in a position to move or both.

Permission for everyone to leave

UBS has merger/integration teams working on what’s to come, but it’s a big task and understandably taking time.

It has become clear that just as Credit Suisse’s Australian franchise wasn’t even a consideration in the Swiss banking merger three weeks ago, there’s not much UBS Australia is doing to move it all along.

By the time it wants to move, if indeed it does, there may not be much left on the Credit Suisse frontline.

Now that Ristevski, well-liked within his team and someone his bankers would have rallied behind in the proposed CSFB spin-off, has left, everyone else has permission to do the same.

In markets – equities, derivatives, fixed income etc – there have already been a handful of departures, including to Barrenjoey and Jefferies. There are more to come, including in the near term.

The only place UBS has moved is in wealth management, with local co-head Nick Hughes last week saying “we recognise the success of Credit Suisse’s Australian private bank, and look forward to building on that success”.

That doesn’t necessarily mean all the private bankers will end up at UBS. Rivals are also lurking there.

https://cointelegraph.com/news/ubs-s-acquisition-of-credit-suisse-brings-some-good-and-bad-for-crypto,UBS’s acquisition of Credit Suisse brings some good and bad for crypto,"On Sunday, March 19, the 167-year history of banking giant Credit Suisse ended with a takeover by the largest Swiss bank, UBS. Under pressure from the Swiss government, UBS took over its ailing competitor for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion) — less than half the $8 billion market value of Credit Suisse just two days before, on Friday, March 17.

A day later, on March 20, shares in Credit Suisse plunged more than 60% in European trading, with UBS down 9%.

To cover any losses UBS may incur in the deal, the Swiss government will provide $10 billion. The Swiss central bank will also make a $108 billion bankruptcy loan available to the banks.

Swiss publication, the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, called the takeover the “biggest economic earthquake in Switzerland since the rescue of UBS in 2008 and the grounding of Swissair in 2001.” A rescue should prevent a crisis that spreads to other banks, akin to what happened 15 years ago after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in the United States. The takeover of Credit Suisse was “necessary” not only for Switzerland but for the stability of the entire global financial system, argued Swiss Confederation President Alain Berset.

Billion-dollar merger over a weekend

The deal spurred mixed reactions in the Swiss political arena. The Free Democratic Party of Switzerland (FDP) praised it, stating that the takeover was necessary to avoid severe damage to Switzerland as a financial and economic center.

Criticism came from the co-president of the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland, Cédric Wermuth, who tweeted that nothing had changed since the 2008 financial crisis. “The whole financial system is sick and absurd,” he said, adding that the state must step in again and save it.

Marcel Fratzscher, president of the German Institute for Economic Research, believes the takeover could lead to one giant bank, which would provoke instability across the board in the event of a notional collapse.

In an interview with Die Tageszeitung, the German economist said the current situation is nowhere near as worrying as before the global financial crisis of 2008. “Today, it is the sharp increases in interest rates by the central banks that have taken many financial institutions by surprise and have led to massive losses.”

In other words, the problem today is “not systemic interdependence between financial institutions or inadequate provisioning in terms of liquidity and capital, but unusually aggressive monetary policy.”

‘Regulatory pressure is likely to increase’

“This takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS has sent many into a deep shock,” said Olga Feldmeier, co-founder of Swiss investment platform Smart Valor, speaking to Cointelegraph. Until 2014, she was an executive director and head of sales in the wealth management business at UBS.

“It had been known for a long time that things were not going so well at the bank. But who would have thought that the bank, which was once worth $80 billion, would be the subject of a $3 billion takeover by its arch-rival UBS?” According to Feldmeier, it’s not just the 50,000 employees who are shocked. The lenders have been hit even harder, especially those with a special high-grade bond type — the so-called Additional Tier 1 Capital.

Recent: Best and worst countries for crypto taxes — plus crypto tax tips

But when asked what the alternative would be, Feldmeier agreed that without this takeover, the consequences would be catastrophic. “After all, where is it safe if one of the top 30 systemically important — and Swiss — banks go bankrupt? In a systemic bank run, neither the European Central Bank nor the Fed would be able to help.”

Mauro Casellini, board member at CCA Trustless Technologies Association and, until January 2023, CEO at Bitcoin Suisse Liechtenstein and head of Bitcoin Suisse Europe, shared a similar view.

He told Cointelegraph that it was right that the government and regulators in Switzerland acted quickly to find a solution with the least possible negative impact on the market.

“Although there had been signs for some time that things were not going smoothly at Credit Suisse, it was difficult for outsiders to see just how critical the situation was. It is too early to say whether this was the right solution, but the sheer size of this new ‘super bank’ is impressive and regulatory pressure is likely to increase,” Casellini said.

The good and the bad

The banking crisis has brought some good and some bad for crypto. Despite negative macroeconomic developments, the crypto market performed well when news broke that UBS would take over Credit Suisse. Bitcoin (BTC) won the crypto rally with a gain of 15.5% (reaching $28,671 on March 22). Ether (ETH) gained 3.9%. Driven by the BTC price rally, the share prices of listed Bitcoin mining companies have risen by as much as 120% since the beginning of the year.

According to Feldmeier, it’s a positive phenomenon for crypto exchanges, both big and small. “More trading, higher sales, some of the long missed tailwind would not hurt our industry,” said Feldmeier. “This also increases the certainty that the Bitcoin cycle keeps what it promises — namely, the next bull run around Bitcoin halving in March 2024”.

The loss from clients and investors in traditional financial institutions could positively affect the crypto market as investors turn to alternative assets, such as cryptocurrencies.

However, the Credit Suisse acquisition and the fact that the banking industry faces many different risks and challenges worldwide also has a negative side. Banks are still important partners for crypto companies. If banks are not doing well, they will be even less willing to work with crypto companies or raise fees, which will not make life easier for the crypto industry.

The recent closures of fiat on- and off-ramp banks such as Silvergate and Signature, followed by the collapse of Credit Suisse, have created “significant risks for the crypto market,” said Casellini. According to the expert, it was necessary “to address issues such as regulation, security, and transparency to build trust with investors and ensure the long-term viability of the market. Regulation will help our industry in the long run to build a successful and more decentralized alternative to the traditional financial system.”

Casellini also expects to see more challenges and risks in the future due to the changing interest rate landscape and additional requirements on banks.

“It will be interesting to see how governments and especially national banks react, and whether they will save struggling banks or let them fail.”",['Veronika Rinecker'],

Iqbal Khan, global head of wealth management at UBS, met with counterparts at Credit Suisse including the lender’s local wealth head Puneet Matta in Singapore in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Khan told Credit Suisse staff that the wealth business in India will likely be retained, they said. The considerations aren’t final, the people said. UBS declined to comment, as did a spokesperson for Credit Suisse.

The Swiss parliament will hold an extraordinary session next week to discuss the emergency merger, which was engineered by the Swiss authorities after Credit Suisse nearly collapsed. To back the takeover and avoid a financial meltdown, the bank was offered nearly 260 billion Swiss francs ($287 billion) of liquidity support and state guarantees.

Keller-Sutter defended the government's intervention, stating that the primary goal of the Federal Council was to ensure the stability of the Swiss economy and financial centre and prevent an international financial crisis. Completing the merger was the highest priority, according to the minister. She also stated that the risks to the taxpayer were acceptable, even though the government could assume up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS by the takeover.

The new combined bank will have $1.6 trillion in assets and more than 120,000 staff. Keller-Sutter also commented on the structure of UBS, stating that it would have to be considered in the future. She explained that UBS would have to hold more equity after the takeover, which could force them to shrink. Switzerland's Competition Commission can also make recommendations, the minister added.

Keller-Sutter criticized the culture at Credit Suisse, which she said had set the wrong incentives and had not learned from previous scandals and prosecutions. She also defended the write-down of AT1 bonds to zero, a controversial part of the rescue. According to Keller-Sutter, these are high-risk bonds with high yields, sometimes over 9%, and the prospectus for these bonds makes it clear that if a company claims indirect government aid, they can be written off.

The special parliamentary session next week was important, she added, and a welcome opportunity to get to the truth of the Credit Suisse debacle. While parliament can ""only"" advise on the commitment credit at the moment, it also has the opportunity to comment on the case and play an active role in the process. Overall, the Finance Minister is optimistic that the merger will proceed smoothly without major political obstacles.

The ""Minsky moment,"" named after the economist Hyman Minsky, is a sudden collapse of the market after a long period of aggressive speculation brought on by easy money. Markets might face a Minsky moment soon, warned Marko Kolanovic, JPMorgan Chase's chief market strategist and co-head of global research.

Markets haven't collapsed. Some bank stocks are in the doldrums, yes, but the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF, a fund of regional bank stocks, rose 1.11% on Monday. Major indexes were up yesterday too. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2%, the S&P 500 added 0.89% and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.39%.

But there are signs market instability is increasing. The banking crisis is causing regional banks — which account for around a third of all lending in the United States — to reduce their loans, said Eric Diton, president and managing director of The Wealth Alliance. In other words, the availability of money in the economy is slowing even without the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates.

Speaking of interest rates, analysts seem to think there's no good path forward for the Fed. An interest rate hike ""would be a mistake,"" MKM Partners Chief Economist Michael Darda told CNBC. On the other hand, a pause would cause ""panicked reactions by equity and bond investors,"" according to Nationwide's Mark Hackett. This suggests markets are already so jittery that whatever the Fed does — even if it's nothing — it might cause instability to spread.

With that in mind, investors might want to heed Kolanovic's warning that a Minsky moment could be on the horizon.

Does A Credit Crunch Still Loom?,"UBS has bought fellow banking giant Credit Suisse in a deal that will create a bank with an $80B commercial real estate loan book and more than $100B of real estate assets under management — making it the fourth-largest CRE lender in the world — but the key element of the deal for CRE is whether it can stop liquidity drying up in the banking system.

UBS' headquarters in Zurich

UBS announced on Sunday that it had agreed a deal to rescue Credit Suisse and would pay about $3.25B for its Swiss rival. Swiss financial regulators changed the law so that shareholders do not have to approve the deal, such was the need to get a speedy transaction completed.

“This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue,” UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said in a press release announcing the deal.

Credit Suisse’s share price had continued to fall last Friday despite the Swiss government agreeing to provide it with $54B of loans to shore up its capital position. That is because depositors including wealthy private clients and big companies had continued to take money out of the bank as they were uncertain about its financial health.

That was the same problem faced by Silicon Valley Bank, and bank shares have dropped sharply across the world in the last week due to nervousness about whether other banks might also fail because depositors and corporate clients pull money for fear of losing it if a lender does collapse.

That lack of trust in the banking system has the possibility to reduce liquidity and could spur banks to pull further bank on lending, keeping as much capital on their balance sheets to insure against further volatility, analysts and investment managers said in the wake of a turbulent week. A further contraction of lending would be negative for the CRE industry, which relies heavily on debt for investment.

A credit crunch could also exacerbate the slide in commercial real estate values that is already underway, Green Street said last week.

“It’s highly unlikely we’ll see a positive scenario, especially taking into account recent events,” Oria Garvey, Federated Hermes senior fixed-income portfolio manager, told the FT. “The issue will be if banks pull back from lending, which has historically had a large impact on growth. But that could be avoided if central banks and regulators step up.”

Regional banks in the U.S. have been a particular focus of concern, partly because of their high exposure to commercial real estate lending, which makes up 28% of their loan book compared to 8% at larger lenders, Federal Reserve data showed.

“More problems may yet emerge at other commercial banks in the U.S.,” Capital Economics said in a note on Friday. “But the industry there as a whole doesn’t have a worryingly high uninsured deposit ratio or unrealized losses on 'held-to-maturity' securities in excess of capital.

""And if more skeletons do emerge from the closet, this is more likely to be the case for banks that have been relatively lightly regulated because they pose less of a risk to the economy.”

Bisnow/Mark Bonner

Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said on Sunday that the federal ceiling for insuring deposits at banks should be raised from the current limit of $250K and speculated it could go as high as $10M. That would mean larger corporate and wealthy individual deposit holders would be less likely to pull their money and create a run on a bank, as they would be comfortable that if a lender did fail their money would be insured. Warren also proposed legislation last week to repeal bank deregulation enacted during Donald Trump’s presidency.

The decline of Silicon Valley Bank was followed by that of Signature Bank, the third-largest real estate lender in New York, and on Friday other U.S. lenders provided more than $30B of liquidity to First Republic Bank, in a move that did not stop its share price from dropping further.

A problem for some lenders, including SVB, is that they took customer deposits and invested the money in bonds. As interest rates have risen, the value of those bonds has dropped. When customers asked for their deposits back, they didn’t have the money to give back to them.

Credit Suisse’s problems go back further, and include a decade of fines for regulatory failures and a slow loss of confidence from wealthy customers.

The financial world is now trying to work out if these failures are isolated or part of a wider pattern. And while that analysis is being undertaken, lending is likely to be scaled back.

“While a 2008-09 banking crisis is not going to arrive ... [banks’ decision to extend less credit supports] the argument that the economy is more likely to slow than advance in the coming months,” TS Lombard Economist Steven Blitz said in a note last week.

As for a combined UBS and Credit Suisse, the bank will have a commercial real estate loan book in the region of $80B, according to an analysis of financial filings by Bisnow. UBS has about $47B of CRE lending on its balance sheet and another $8B off balance sheet, its 2022 annual report showed.

Credit Suisse has about $25B in CRE lending, its annual report said. That combined $80B would make it the fourth-largest CRE lender in the world, vying with Bank of America for the No. 3 slot, according to a ranking compiled by American Banker magazine. One caveat is that list does not include Chinese banks likely to have huge CRE lending portfolios. Wells Fargo and JP Morgan are the top two.

The combined asset management business of the two banks will have more than $100B of real estate assets under management. Credit Suisse Asset Management had $62B of real estate AUM as of June. UBS does not provide such a specific breakdown, but its real estate and private markets fund management business has more than $100B in assets under management, more than half of which are likely to be in real estate.

Credit Suisse Real Estate Fund International, a $3.5B real estate fund, has some of its largest holdings in Boston; Austin, Texas; and Vancouver, Canada.

Last month, Credit Suisse began limiting withdrawals from the fund after investors holding about 13.3% of the fund’s shares requested to pull out cash after their valuations were hit by rising interest rates.

The fund had been down about 5% in the past five years and was expected to drop another 10%.

Key Facts

Credit Suisse shares slid more than 60% at the start of trading on Monday morning in Zurich, continuing a poor streak that saw shares hit an all-time low last week. UBS shares also dropped more than 9% in early trading. Other leading European banks, including BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Santander and Deutsche Bank were also down between 3% and 6% on Monday morning. They lead a broader market dip in Europe, with key indexes also down, including London’s FTSE 100 (0.8%), Germany’s Dax (0.35%), France's CAC (0.3%) and Spain’s Ibex (1.04%). The price of oil also hit its lowest level since December 2021, with Brent crude, a major international benchmark, falling 2.5%, continuing a recent downwards trend and approaching $70 a barrel.

News Peg

UBS announced plans to buy its beleaguered Swiss rival Credit Suisse on Sunday. The $3.2 billion deal, partly an effort to calm roiling financial markets, is a huge discount given Credit Suisse’s market valuation and heralds the creation of a new Swiss banking behemoth and the start of a new era for lending in Switzerland. It also marks the demise of a once stalwart member of the global financial system that for years was considered too big and too important to fail. Years of unrest following a string of controversies—including charges of money laundering, sanctions breaches, corruption, fraud and tax evasion, links with collapsed firms Archegos and Greensill Capital and revelations it had spied on its own staff—eroded that position. Its position grew terminal last week after its delayed annual report acknowledged “material weaknesses” in financial reporting and sent shares into freefall.

What To Watch For

Credit Suisse’s downfall comes at a poor time for global financial markets, which are already reeling from the recent failure of two U.S. institutions: Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature. Credit Suisse bondholders are likely to be angry following the deal, as their investments are likely to be wiped out, a move that could exacerbate market worries. Though the troubled Swiss bank’s problems long predate the collapse of the two institutions, the loss of such a historic institution will also undoubtedly intensify concerns. In premarket trading early Monday morning, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase were down more than 1% and Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America between 0.4% and 0.6%. From market close on Friday, all were down between 3% and 4% on Monday morning.

Tangent

Asian markets also responded negatively to the news of UBS’ acquisition. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell more than 2.6% on Monday. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was also down 1.4% and the Shanghai Composite Index down 0.48%.

UBS took over Credit Suisse on Sunday in a £2.65bn deal forced through by Swiss authorities amid fears that a failure to protect depositors would kickstart a global banking crisis.

In a letter to staff seen by the Guardian, the Credit Suisse group chief executive, Ulrich Körner, said it had “been an emotional and challenging week for all of us. He thanked employees for their “unwavering commitment and for the support you have given our clients and each other during this difficult time”.

Korner said the deal with UBS had been the “only viable option” and it “brings both stability and certainty to our clients and to the market”.

Switzerland’s government said earlier this week that Credit Suisse was ordered to temporarily suspend bonus payments awarded in the years up to 2022.

In the letter, Körner acknowledged concerns about the ban among its 45,000-strong workforce and said discussions concerning the matter with Swiss authorities were “ongoing”. There are more than 5,000 Credit Suisse and about 6,000 UBS staff based in London. “We do not yet have an answer, but we know how important this is for many of you,” he said.

Korner said that a deal of the scale of the UBS merger would typically take six months to agree, but the emergency transaction had taken just four days, leaving many practicalities unresolved.

He said: “Until the transaction legally closes later this year, we remain two independent banks and must continue to work that way. Please stay focused on our clients and continue to provide them with the outstanding service they expect from us.”

Körner, who become chief executive in July 2022 after former boss Thomas Gottstein was ousted, said he remains “fully committed” to the bank. “I will be at your side as we work to make the transaction a success,” he said.

The UBS deal was agreed after it became clear the $54bn loan to Credit Suisse from the Swiss central bank had failed to halt a sharp slide in its share price.

Credit Suisse’s travails have sent jitters through markets. On Friday, banking stocks suffered a sharp sell-off, including Deutsche Bank, which fell as much as 14% before recovering some ground.",['Alex Lawson'],2023-03-24 00:00:00

Michael Kunz is with Luzerner Kantonalbank. They are in Lucerne and it's a big deal in Switzerland to have these separate Kanton banks, which are the heritage and fabric. He has done tours of duty extensively at the Union Bank of Switzerland and also a Credit Suisse. Mr. Kunz joins us this morning. Michael, thank you so much for coming on. Can you imagine UBS and Credit Suisse? You've worked at both. Can you imagine them merging? Ah frankly speaking, no. The competition authorities would have a problem. And the complexity of the merger is just too large to piece our mountains. That's a very complex task with overlapping West management in all sectors, in all regions. People that have banking with Credit Suisse so far have deliberately not been banking with UBS and vice versa. And a merger of those two would see a ton of a major shift in decision making. One of the great heritage we've seen, we talked about this, I believe it was yesterday, is traditional EU executive management. And then, for example, at Deutsche Bank, Mr Sewing came in to save the day with a more verbal, more outgoing management is the major challenge at Credit Suisse is they're working under an old EU model and they need a new executive regime to create action to fix this crisis. There's probably one factor of the whole bundle of problems. I mean, they have had quite a few management changes the last couple of years, but ultimately each new leader has just reshuffled some or a charge. Bob one presentation and the strategic setup of the bank has not really been altered sufficiently. It's they need to get something moving.

An earlier report from the Financial Times claimed UBS had agreed to buy Credit Suisse for over $2 billion, citing a person familiar with the matter. However, a most recent statement from UBS has revealed that the total consideration for the deal is approximately 3 billion Swiss francs, or $3.25 billion. That’s still a deep discount to Credit Suisse’s March 17 market capitalization of 7.5 billion francs, or $8 billion.

“This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue. We have structured a transaction which will preserve the value left in the business while limiting our downside exposure,” said UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher.

To close the deal, Swiss authorities agreed to change the country's regulations to bypass a shareholder vote and announce the deal over the weekend, ahead of the market opening.

Also, as part of the deal, the Swiss National Bank has committed to providing over $100 billion in liquidity to UBS, according to reports.

The discussions were initiated jointly by the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and the Swiss National Bank, and the acquisition has their full support, UBS said in its statement.

Swiss authorities considered alternatives to Credit Suisse in case the deal with UBS failed over the weekend, including a full or partial nationalization of the bank as an emergency option.

Credit Suisse’s rescue plan would also include losses to bondholders, prompting concerns by European regulators that it would undermine investor confidence in Europe’s financial sector.

UBS and Credit Suisse have been locked in talks with regulators since March 15, after Credit Suisse’s largest shareholder, Saudi National Bank, said that it wouldn’t increase its investment in the Swiss bank due to regulations. Concerns about the bank’s ability to profit were heightened by the comments, raising fears about possible shareholder financing.

Credit Suisse was founded in 1856 to finance the expansion of Swiss railroads. It was considered the second-largest bank in the country.

This follows weekend talks trying to agree to a rescue before trading opened on Monday.

The Swiss National Bank said at a press conference in Bern on Sunday evening that UBS would be taking over embattled lender Credit Suisse.

The deal will see UBS acquire Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.23 billion).

Swiss President Alain Berset said that the Swiss Federal Council welcomed the takeover as it was the ""best solution"" to restore and strengthen market confidence in Credit Suisse and the Swiss financial center.

It was not immediately clear whether the rescue would calm investor concerns about the banking sector more generally.

How are markets reacting?

As they had hoped, Swiss authorities reached an accord just in time for the first stock markets in Australia, New Zealand and Asia to open for Monday trading in the coming hours, when the first indications might appear.

The US Federal Reserve and other central banks also sought Sunday to ease fears through a coordinated effort to increase liquidity in the banking sector. The British, Canadian, Swiss and EU central banks are reportedly involved iin the effort to step up access to dollars in so-called swap line operations.

Early Monday, Hong Kong's monetary authorities said Credit Suisse opened as usual and the local banking sector's exposure is ""insignificant."" Shares however did drop across Asia on opening as markets retreated slightly.

What more do we know?

Government and banking officials had been locked in urgent talks to rescue the embattled lender, which was given a $54 billion (€50 billion) lifeline by the country's central bank this week.

Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said at the press conference that the government in Bern had agreed to provide guarantees of up to 9 billion Swiss francs to underwrite the takeover. But Keller-Sutter said these guarantees would apply only to a ""very specific portfolio, which UBS is now taking over.""

She also said that the guarantees would only start to apply if UBS's losses connected to the takeover exceeded 5 billion francs.

Merger builds on 'best skills available' — UBS chair

Chair of UBS Colm Kelleher repeatedly referred to the deal as either an ""integration"" or ""transaction.""

Kelleher said the merger would ""enhance the combined organization's ability to serve our clients and deepen our best-in-class capabilities.""

However, he also sought to reassure those outside the banking sector that UBS would reduce the amount of risk Credit Suisse is exposed to, and that it recognized the need to keep capital available amid the war in Ukraine and unusually high inflation.

""We are also aware of the need to support the broader Swiss economy and our clients at a time when macroeconomic uncertainty makes business conditions challenging and unpredictable,"" Kelleher said, before moving on to his goal of downsizing Credit Suisse's investment banking activities.

""Let me be very specific on this: UBS intends to downsize Credit Suisse’s investment banking businesses and align it with our conservative risk culture. It is intended that the combined investment banking businesses will over time account for no more than 20% of the group’s risk-weighted assets.""

Deal worth less than half of shares' face value

Earlier there were reports, including from The Financial Times, that UBS had offered to buy the bank for up to 1 billion Swiss francs, and then later 2 billion Swiss francs, but Credit Suisse had reportedly pushed back against these offers,

In the 3 billion franc deal, UBS will pay 0.76 Swiss francs (around $0.82 or €0.77) per Credit Suisse share, well below the closing price of 1.86 francs on Friday. That would make the bank's value by market capitalization around $7 billion, while as recently as a year ago Credit Suisse was valued at roughly $25 billion by shareholders.

But UBS is also assuming liability for 5 billion francs in losses before government support would kick in, according to the Swiss finance minister.

UBS and Credit Suisse said the deal was not subject to shareholder approval, suggesting the Swiss government waived this requirement in this case.

https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/our-approach/marketnews/article.1587934.html,Can alternatives help navigate correlated markets?,"Diversifying into hedge funds and private markets can help investors access less-correlated returns. (ddp)

In hedge funds, we like uncorrelated strategies such as macro. Meanwhile, private market secondaries and distressed strategies could be well positioned to buy assets at attractive valuations.

Uncertainty and macro risks are likely to stay elevated.

While central banks are seeking to quell market concerns over financial stability on both sides of the Atlantic, fears of persistent price pressures and monetary policy are likely to stay in focus.

Alternatives should continue to play an important role in diversifying portfolios as long as investors are aware of the risks, including reduced liquidity, higher costs, and complexities.

Hedge funds can provide uncorrelated returns.

Historically, macro hedge funds have shown an ability to take advantage of tighter monetary policy, higher volatility across asset classes, and identify opportunities in uncertain economic environments.

Low net equity long-short strategies have shown they can benefit from market dispersion, mitigate market directionality, and complement traditional equity positions.

Multi-strategy funds can provide investors with highly attractive risk-return characteristics and strong portfolio effects in periods of market turmoil.

Private market investments also look compelling.

We generally prefer accessing growth opportunities through buyout and growth equity strategies, which should be less affected by the recent banking stress.

We recommend seeking exposure to value-oriented buyout strategies and expect transaction activity on the secondary market to accelerate.

We think private debt, particularly direct lending strategies, should prove resilient in the current environment.

Did you know?

Both hedge funds and private markets come with certain drawbacks, including the risk of an illiquid market. Investors need to be willing and able to lock up capital for longer.

Historically, when implied volatility has been elevated, equities have generated an average loss of 11.3%, while macro strategies were able to capitalize on market stress to produce 6.1% annualized returns.

Private market investments can provide attractive absolute risk-adjusted returns over the long term. Between 2001 and 2021, global private equity returned 13.8%annually, versus 7.1% in publicly traded global equities.

Direct lending, which represents most private debt assets, is senior in the capital structure and is extended to private-equity-backed companies with recurrent cash flows and solid financials.

Investment view

With uncertainty and macro risks likely to stay elevated, we recommend investors diversify into less correlated strategies such as hedge funds and private markets.

The Swiss government, central bank, and financial regulators forced UBS to buy Credit Suisse for $3.25 billion after its share price plummeted on March 15, causing fears of a growing banking crisis. The merger of the two biggest banks in Switzerland prompted the UBS board to turn once more to Ermotti, believing him to be a better pilot than the current Dutch CEO Ralph Hamers to navigate the new flight path.

According to UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher, Ermotti is well-suited to lead the acquisition of Credit Suisse because he has experience in handling difficult situations and putting out fires. Ermotti himself said he feels a sense of responsibility to return to UBS and oversee the merger, which is expected to be very challenging.

Ermotti will have to merge two institutions that were both among the 30 banks around the world deemed of global importance to the banking system. UBS came under criticism following its bailout by the state during the 2008 financial crisis.

The UBS board believes Ermotti is a better pilot to navigate the acquisition of Credit Suisse. The merger has triggered unease in Switzerland, with choice for customers and small businesses seriously reduced. Ermotti will have to lead the somewhat forced marriage with care.

https://www.businessinsider.com/ubs-acquisition-credit-suisse-swiss-banking-wealth-management-2023-3,Swiss Miss: Why UBS's deal with Credit Suisse will threaten its hold on rich clients,"UBS was already a giant in wealth management before it agreed to buy doomed rival Credit Suisse.

Ultra-rich clients are concerned that the acquisition will impact the bank's white-glove service.

Whether clients stay or go depends on how quickly UBS can cure Credit Suisse's woes.

UBS was already the largest private wealth manager in the world before it agreed to buy fellow Swiss bank Credit Suisse. A forced merger will now broaden UBS's already sprawling client base, but it will also invite challenges for its wealth brand across the globe.

UBS and Credit Suisse are both known for servicing the ultra-rich, though UBS does so on a much larger scale. The acquirer had $2.8 trillion in global wealth management assets as of the end of 2022 while Credit Suisse's totalled $585 billion.

Rich clients as well as industry analysts are concerned that UBS will have to spend considerable time and resources to integrate Credit Suisse, which has been plagued by scandals for several years. For instance, Credit Suisse's then-CEO Tidjane Thiam was ousted in 2019 after it was discovered the bank had hired spies to trail star banker Iqbal Khan after he departed for UBS. Khan now leads UBS's global wealth business and could be responsible for integrating the two.

Rich families, who tend to spread their money with banks across the globe, are ""concerned at what UBS might find and the drain it might take on UBS,"" said Wendy Craft, who runs the family office of New York real-estate heir Kent Swig. ""If you need to bank in Switzerland, you may have to, but short of that, folks are in a wait-and-see mode.""

Michael Oliver, cofounder of Global Partnership Family Offices, has gotten numerous inquiries from members of the UK-based family office association about the acquisition. Most are worried about the interruption of the white-glove service they have come to expect from UBS. Credit Suisse's baggage doesn't help UBS's brand either.

""Credit Suisse's reputation is worse than UBS in the family office ecosystem. Does that degrade UBS by their combination? Yes,"" said Oliver.

But he added that this is only one factor in clients' decision-making process when it comes to choosing a wealth manager.

What will determine how many clients stay or go is how quickly UBS can integrate the best parts of Credit Suisse and cut the rest. If the takeover distracts UBS management from its core business of wealth management, this well-heeled crowd has plenty of options outside Switzerland.

One plus one doesn't equal two when it comes to client assets

In the US, little is expected to change when it comes to wealth management as Credit Suisse sold off its domestic wealth business to Wells Fargo in 2015. (Investment banking is another story). Insider spoke to two private wealth advisors based in North America who said they weren't worried and clients have not expressed concerns.

But the impact will be felt overseas. With mass layoffs expected at Credit Suisse, customers may choose to follow their advisors and bankers rather than stay with the newly merged institution, said Max Georgiou, a London-based analyst at Third Bridge.

""Our experts say that with thousands of redundancies on the way, it is highly likely that some of the Credit Suisse management team will use their extensive contacts to start up their own wealth managers,"" Georgiou told Insider. ""These start-ups and the increased competition they will bring could peel away some clients from the newly merged bank.""

Furthermore, this clientele prefers to bank with multiple institutions, he added. As Switzerland only had two banking giants, many clients already had accounts with both. With this merger, they may move some assets to other private banks to reduce exposure. Mid-sized private banks such as Lombard, Julius Baer, and Pictet, may be big beneficiaries from this migration, he said.

According to a Reuters report, Credit Suisse's employees in wealth management in Zurich were reassured at a town hall on Monday that the combined units would act like a ""big family"" and that UBS is weighing financial sweeteners to reassure staff. UBS did not immediately respond to a request to comment on its plans.

Repairing and integrating Credit Suisse might be a distraction

Firdaus Ibrahim, Kuala Lumpur-based senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Insider that the acquisition confers several advantages to UBS, such as more opportunities for cross-selling and a greater foothold in Southeast Asia. That said, while UBS is better placed to fix Credit Suisse's issues, it is still a monumental task.

""There is no quick and easy solution to this. UBS needs to dispose and restructure underperforming business units, put in the right people, and improve risk and control measures throughout the CS business so that past mishaps and scandals do not occur again,"" said Ibrahim. ""All of this requires significant time and effort from the management team.""

Swiss banks, despite their shadowy reputation, are no longer as secretive as they used to be, and have shared account data with foreign tax authorities since 2018.

""The proposition has evolved. It has been as much about discretion as it has been about secrecy for decades now,"" said Oliver. ""There is still an expectation of excellence with Swiss banking: high levels of client service is key.""

The expenses associated with the Credit Suisse acquisition might hamstring UBS when it comes to growth in the US. New York-based recruiter Louis Diamond said these costs may stop the bank's aggressive recruitment efforts.

""Are they going to have enough profits to keep investing in the business because they really need to keep pace with Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo, which are investing heavily in the wealth management business?"" he said. ""That's the big question.""

But the merger gives UBS and Credit Suisse clients the thing that matters most

But the acquisition wasn't just about rescuing Credit Suisse but restoring confidence in the Swiss banking system, Ibrahim noted. The lifeline provided by the Swiss government indicates that the new bank is too big to fail.

""This should strengthen the appeal of Swiss banking industry, in my view, as clients and investors can be assured that their interest is being looked after by the regulators,"" he said.

In the short term, clients are most concerned about deposit safety and asset protection, according to Oliver, despite concerns about future service.

On Thursday, sources told Bloomberg the Swiss government may be trying to arrange a merger between UBS and Credit Suisse in a move the paper said was being resisted by both sides. Reuters reported Friday that Credit Suisse AG's CFO has called a Saturday meeting to explore possible options—including a sale, break up or winding down of any combination of the firm's operations.

Despite a $54 billion loan from the Swiss central bank this week, investors continue losing faith in the company. Credit Suisse shares slid nearly 7% on the day by Friday's close. Other financial institutions are reportedly distancing themselves from the firm, with Reuters reporting four major banks have limited their dealings with Credit Suisse and its securities.

For its part, the U.S. Treasury Department is reportedly reviewing the financial sector's exposure to the bank, according to Bloomberg.

The bank has spent the last few days trying to recover after its shares hit all-time lows Wednesday. Despite the liquidity infusion and vote of confidence from the Swiss National Bank, reports have surfaced of the firm exploring different options.

The Swiss lender is leading gains among European banks this week, as fears around the stability of the finance sector eased after the $3 billion emergency takeover. Shares gained as much as 3.6% to 20.12 Swiss francs on Wednesday, while the company’s bonds recovered some of the losses taken in recent days.

The stock pared gains to trade flat at 19.39 francs as of 11:51 a.m. in Zurich, but is about 14% higher since the Sunday agreement brokered by the Swiss government. Bonds are up between 1-5 cents from Monday’s lows across the board.

The last-minute merger brokered by the Swiss government on Sunday has left investors racing to break down the implications for UBS, one of the world’s largest wealth managers. For now, the benefits in terms of potential cost-savings and dramatically improved market share are outweighing concerns about the complexity of integrating Credit Suisse and the risks on its balance sheet.

“Market sentiment seemed to have turned positive, with the risk of other European banks impacted by an outright failure of Credit Suisse subsiding,” said Johann Scholtz, an equity analyst at Morningstar Inc. “UBS’s gains yesterday reflect our view that this can be a favorable deal for UBS in the long term. In the short term, volatility should remain in the European banking space.”

US bank shares have also been stabilizing from a selloff generated by troubles at regional lenders and the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, following reassurances from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that the government could intervene to protect the broader US banking system.

“The biggest pressure point or danger is market participants conflating these events into a 2008 crisis narrative, when we do not view it as that at all,” said David Storm, chief investment officer for RBC Wealth Management.

Earlier Wednesday, the Swiss lender announced it is offering to buy back 2.75 billion euros worth of bonds it issued to investors just days before rescuing Credit Suisse.

Credit Risk

UBS’s credit risk has been jolted since concern over Credit Suisse’s fate, and the role UBS would play in it, roiled global markets. After the deal was announced, the cost of insuring UBS’s debt for one year soared to a record.

On Wednesday UBS’s credit default swaps fell further from Monday’s highs. Yet, UBS Group’s five-year CDS remain at elevated levels.

The buyback decision was a “reasonable action to give investors the option to sell back the bonds should they, having known what they know now, have chosen not to invest,” said Andrew Wong, a credit analyst at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.

UBS is taking a selective approach to the staff and assets it has inherited from Credit Suisse. The lender wants to cherry pick top dealmakers from Credit Suisse Group AG’s investment bank instead of supporting Michael Klein’s plan to build a new independent firm, according to people familiar with the discussions.

It has been an historic few weeks in the financial markets. Over one weekend the financial services landscape changed drastically. Many questions remain after the fire sale of Credit Suisse to UBS and it will be months, if not years, before the dust fully settles. One thing is certain: the new combined asset management business now becomes one of the largest in Europe with nearly $1.5trn (£1.2trn) assets under management (AUM).

This acquisition was by no means part of UBS’s long-term strategy, but the UBS chair has suggested it will take three to four years to fully integrate Credit Suisse on to the UBS platform. One side effect is further consolidation within the asset management industry. Combining the two asset management units adds a layer of complexity to this project but will surely be an important priority for the UBS board.

There are opportunities to be had with this seismic shift. Thinking about the specific challenges for asset management businesses today, undoubtedly the leading one is fee pressure. The pressure is being driven by changing investor preferences that favour low-fee products like index funds and model-driven strategies, in addition to the challenging market environment for achieving returns.

In most cases during the M&A cycle over the last decade, a combination of asset management businesses has provided the scale to overcome the downward pressure on fees, both through sheer scale in asset growth as well as being able to leverage a much bigger pool of data to inform investment decision making. But while consolidation is additive to earnings and provides lots of data to utilise for the creation of new products and strategies, moving to a data-first operating model becomes a big challenge.

Profitability for the new Swiss investment management giant will require more than just size and operational efficiency. The new firm will have to deal with the data explosion that is occurring across the industry and is expected to continue well into the future. Organisational discipline and a data-centric approach to investing and operations is essential. This data explosion encompasses all parts of the organization, including front, middle, and back-office teams, who need on-demand access to these high-quality data sets to help make investment decisions, launch new products, manage relationships and meet regulatory requirements.

Traditionally, asset management has been slightly behind the curve compared to its sell-side cousins on the deployment and use of quantitative data, whether for trading, research or regulatory compliance. This has changed, and now data is the heart of the asset management operating model.

Sales and marketing teams have been the leaders in a data-driven approach, using numerical insights to monitor and assess the success of the fund’s product promotion. Until recently, the front office has lagged behind, clinging to qualitative investment processes that use the portfolio manager’s ‘secret sauce’ that cannot scale with a growing organisation.

Innovative managers have been adopting new technologies that allow them to take full advantage of a data-first culture. By using data to drive decisions from risk management to asset allocation, trading and product management, clients will have better investment outcomes that meet their long-term investment objectives.

Onboarding new asset management businesses will naturally introduce data silos across different parts of the combined entity. With a combination such as UBS and Credit Suisse, both of which operate their asset management businesses globally, there will be a requirement to audit the widespread depositing of data across the many offices and file systems. For this data to be used across the different parts of the firm, it needs to be pulled from the many systems that will naturally exist in isolation.

Ultimately the goal for asset managers of all sizes is the same – to effectively integrate data into their research and remain competitive in this fast-changing market. The somewhat unwanted consolidation and creation of this Swiss giant may provide opportunities for UBS to increase fee-earning potential, but it is crucial they approach this integration with a data-centric approach utilising centralised cloud-based data management systems. If so the different parts of the asset management arm can work together to offer their unique insight and generate more returns.",['Portfolio Adviser'],
https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/our-approach/marketnews/article.1582555.html,2023 retirement guide: SECURE 2.0 Act and RMDs,"Thanks to the SECURE 2.0 Act, if you reach age 72 in 2023 or later, then you don’t have to start taking RMDs until you reach age 73. (UBS)

The SECURE 2.0 Act was created to make it easier for Americans to save more money for retirement. And, while these provisions will benefit investors regardless of how close to, or far into, retirement they are, several provisions won’t be effective immediately.

Here we highlight changes to Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs). The full report 2023 Retirement Guide covers additional provisions that are particularly important to individuals with assets held in employer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs in the coming years. Please keep in mind that the provisions are subject to additional clarification and interpretation, so please consult with your plan provider, financial advisor, and tax advisor before taking any action in response to the provisions listed below.

Changes to RMDs

1. Increase in age for RMDs: If you’re turning age 72 this year, your retirement assets get to stay invested in your account for one more year.



Thanks to the SECURE 2.0 Act, if you reach age 72 in 2023 or later, then you don’t have to start taking RMDs until you reach age 73. And, if you reach age 73 in 2033 or later, then you won’t be subject to RMDs until you reach age 75. Although, the effective date for when the applicable age will increase to 75 is pending clarification.

If your birth year is between 1951 and 1959, the age when RMD begins is 73. If your birth year is 1960 or later, the age when RMD begins is 75.

If you turn age 73 in 2024, you have until 1 April 2025 to satisfy your first RMD (2024’s RMD). And you’ll have until 31 December 2025 to take your second RMD. Please bear in mind, if you choose to take both RMDs in a single tax year, if could cost you more in taxes by pushing you into a higher tax bracket.



If you are not yet taking RMDs, the delayed RMD age means that you can delay taking assets from your retirement accounts, but that does not necessarily mean that you should. After all, deferring your taxable retirement account withdrawals—and thus compressing your taxable income into fewer years—could push you into a higher tax bracket in later years, increasing the overall tax cost of funding your retirement.



Instead of sticking to the minimum distributions required by the government, we recommend working with your financial advisor and your tax advisor on a strategy that maximizes your after-tax wealth potential.

One strategy is to take advantage of your “gap years”: the period between your retirement date and the point at which you begin receiving Social Security benefits and taking RMDs. During these years, you will generally have lower-than-normal taxable income, and thus face lower-than-normal tax rates. By moving some of your taxable income from later retirement years (when you will face a higher tax bracket) into your gap years, you can reduce the overall income tax rate on your retirement account distributions.



In some cases, you may want to take advantage of your gap years by distributing the funds to your taxable account and either reinvesting them or using them to fund near-term spending. In other cases, we would recommend implementing partial Roth conversions, transferring a portion of your Traditional IRA/401(k) to a Roth IRA/401(k).

The dollar amount of your Roth conversion will count as taxable income, so conversions in low-tax years are a great way to fund tax-exempt assets that will continue growing, won't be subject to lifetime RMDs, and will pass income tax-free to your beneficiaries. For more information, please see ""You should consider a partial Roth conversion this year.”



2. Reduced penalty for failure to take your RMD: Before the SECURE 2.0 Act was passed, if you failed to take your RMD on time, you would be subject to a penalty tax of 50% of the RMD amount that was not distributed.



Beginning in 2023, this penalty is reduced to 25%. What’s more, if you are able to correct the missed RMD in a timely manner, the penalty is reduced further to 10% of the RMD amount that was not taken on time.

3. Roth 401(k)s are now exempt from RMDs: Under current law, you are required to take lifetime RMDs from your Roth-designated account in an employer retirement plan (e.g., 401(k) plans), but not from your Roth IRAs.



Starting in 2024, you will no longer be required to take lifetime RMDs from Roth assets in 401(k) plans. This means, once this rule takes effect, Roth assets in Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s will both be exempt from lifetime RMDs.



4. Surviving spouse election to be treated as employee: The SECURE 2.0 Act expands the post-death RMD options for surviving spouses to include the ability to elect to be treated as the deceased spouse (beginning in 2024). Once the election is made, it cannot be revoked except with the consent of the Secretary.

A surviving spouse who makes this election would begin RMDs no earlier than the date the deceased spouse would have reached the applicable RMD age. If the surviving spouse dies before RMDs begin, the RMD rules would apply as if the surviving spouse was the employee. This means that the surviving spouse's beneficiaries will be treated as though they were the original beneficiaries of the account.

Additionally, if the surviving spouse is the employee's sole designated beneficiary, then the applicable distribution period is determined using the uniform table. It's important to note that clarification on how this will work is needed.

For more ways the Secure 2.0 Act will affect retirement and what's new with Social Security and Medicare in the light of recent inflationary pressures, see the full report 2023 Retirement Guide 6 January 2023.

“A failure of Credit Suisse would have had disastrous consequences,” the Swiss president said.

Swiss authorities defended the state-brokered merger of the country’s two largest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, in an emergency parliamentary session called to scrutinise the decision.

The Swiss President, Alain Berset, argued “the Federal Council was obliged to intervene to maintain stability both in Switzerland and internationally and to protect the economy.”

“A failure of Credit Suisse would have had disastrous consequences,” he said.

The emergency session, only the third in over twenty years, cannot annul the deal as it has already been confirmed by a small group of senior MPs.

One of those MPs, Peter Hegglin, also stressed that there was no other option to the takeover, although he remained critical of Credit Suisse’s leadership team.

“The decision wasn’t easy for me,” he said. “The banking industry was warned by the 2008 crisis — unfortunately, Credit Suisse’s leadership didn’t learn from the crisis,” he said.

“Like in a dramatic tragedy, the managers destroyed values and made themselves rich in the process,” Hegglin continued.

Other parliamentarians hit out at the takeover. “Credit Suisse’s leadership has to take responsibility for its actions, that’s not only dictated by fairness,” Hansjoerg Knecht said.

“Tens of thousands of employees worry for their jobs,” he continued.

In March, UBS acquired Credit Suisse for a discount $3.25bn in an attempt to preserve the global financial system from a wider meltdown. In effect the deal is backstopped by the Swiss government, which has assured liquidity assistance for the newly merged entity.

While the parliamentarians cannot overturn the deal, they can signal their discontent and raise questions about the likely impact the takeover will have on the Swiss economy.

The emergency session is expected to go on for a few days and lawmakers are expected to raise concerns about possible job cuts and the impact on the economy of having one bank which is more than twice the size of the entire Swiss economy.

The Swiss Bank Employees’ Association wrote a letter to the Swiss parliament earlier today demanding that any job cuts be frozen. Reports last month suggested that UBS would cut up to a third of the bank’s workforce.

The deal has been deeply unpopular with shareholders, politicians and the broader public. The country’s two largest political parties have already both expressed discontent with the takeover in different ways.",['Chris Dorrell'],2023-04-11 14:18:18+00:00

""An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.”Switzerland's executive branch, a seven-member governing body that includes Berset, passed an emergency ordinance allowing the merger to go through without shareholder approval.Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann called the sale “a clear turning point.”“It is a historic, sad and very challenging day for Credit Suisse, for Switzerland and for the global financial markets,” Lehmann said, adding that the focus is now on the future and in particular on the 50,000 Credit Suisse employees, 17,000 of whom are in Switzerland.Following news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated financial moves to stabilize banks in the coming week. This includes daily access to a lending facility for banks looking to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice which widely used during the 2008 financial crisis. Three months after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September of 2008, such swap lines had been tapped for $580 billion. Added swap lines were also rolled out during market turmoil in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic in March of 2020.“Today is one of the most significant days in European banking since 2008, with far-reaching repercussions for the industry,"" said Max Georgiou , an analyst at Third Bridge. “These events could alter the course of not only European banking but also the wealth management industry more generally.”Colm Kelleher , the UBS chairman, hailed the “enormous opportunities” that emerge from the takeover, and highlighted his bank’s “conservative risk culture” — a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse's reputation for more swashbuckling, aggressive gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said the council ""regrets that the bank, which was once a model institution in Switzerland and part of our strong location, was able to get into this situation at all.”The combination of the two biggest and best-known Swiss banks, each with storied histories dating to the mid-19th century, amounts to a thunderclap for Switzerland’s reputation as a global financial center — leaving it on the cusp of having a single national champion in banking.The deal follows the collapse of two large US banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the U.S. government to prevent any further panic. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse’s share price began plummeting this week.European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde lauded the “swift action” by Swiss officials, saying they were “instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.”She said the banks “are in a completely different position from 2008” during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.UBS officials said they plan to sell off parts of Credit Suisse or reduce the bank's size in the coming months and years.The Swiss government is providing more than 100 billion francs in aid and financial backstops to make the deal go through.As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out. European bank regulators use a special type of bond designed to provide a capital cushion to banks in times of distress. But these bonds are designed to be wiped out if a bank’s capital falls below a certain level, which was triggered as part of this government-brokered deal.Berset said the Federal Council had already been discussing a long-troubled situation at Credit Suisse since the beginning of the year and held urgent meetings in the last four days amid spiraling concerns about its financial health that caused major swoons in its stock price and raised the specter of the 2007-08 financial crisis.Investors and banking industry analysts were still digesting the deal, but at least one analyst was sour on the news because it could damage Switzerland’s global banking image.“A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,” said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas LLC, in an email.Credit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.The Credit Suisse parent bank is not part of European Union supervision, but it has entities in several European countries that are. Lagarde reiterated what she said last week after the central bank raised interest rates — that the European banking sector is resilient, with strong financial reserves and plenty of ready cash.Many of Credit Suisse’s problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.The deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn't invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.On Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ubs-buying-credit-suisse-emissions-101035925.html,"UBS Is Buying Credit Suisse’s Emissions Burden, Too","(Bloomberg) --

Most Read from Bloomberg

During the final week that Credit Suisse Group AG existed as an independent entity, its chairman and chief executive took some time to pen remarks for the embattled bank’s sustainability report.

Axel Lehmann and Ulrich Körner provided their expectations for what Credit Suisse would look like in 2050. It would be—in their words—a cleaner, greener, more sustainable bank after having traversed the choppy waters of the energy transition and eliminated carbon emissions from its operations and financing activities.

As we now know, the Swiss lender, its leaders and their vision proved anything but sustainable. Indeed, now that the 166-year-old bank is in the process of being digested by UBS Group AG, the report reads like a user’s manual for an appliance that is no longer in production.

That’s not the end of the story, though. Just as UBS is sorting through Credit Suisse’s assets, properties and personnel, it’s also taking on its former rival’s carbon emissions. And that’s going to be an added burden for UBS, given its lower emissions profile.

“UBS is in a much better shape when it comes to sustainability and climate-risk performance, so adding Credit Suisse will certainly be a drag,” said Christoph Klein, founder and managing partner at ESG Portfolio Management, a Frankfurt-based asset manager with funds targeting sustainable outcomes. “They can harmonize ESG and climate policies quite easily, but improving the emissions profile of the acquired loans and investment portfolios might be costly and take time.”

Of course it’s still early days. UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher has acknowledged that the bank planned some consolidation as part of the deal. How much of Credit Suisse will be fully incorporated, or jettisoned, may remain unknown for some time. (UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment.)

Story continues

But at least one thing is certain: UBS has performed better than Credit Suisse on most sustainability emissions-related metrics:

Loans to fossil-fuel companies: Since the Paris Agreement was announced at the end of 2015, Credit Suisse has provided $21.7 billion of loans to fossil-fuel companies. In the same period, UBS arranged just $6.4 billion of such loans, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Climate disclosures: UBS had an “A” grade from CDP for 2022; Credit Suisse was lowered to “C.”

ESG Scores: MSCI gives UBS an ESG a score of AA; Credit Suisse has an A grade.

Sustainable finance: UBS plans to allocate $400 billion to so-called sustainable investments by 2025; Credit Suisse has a goal of at least $325 billion of sustainable financing by 2030.

Own emissions: UBS’s scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2022 totaled 12,400 metric tons of CO2 equivalent; Credit Suisse emissions were 19,971 metric tons.

Financed emissions: For 2021, UBS recorded a 42% reduction in absolute emissions in lending to the fossil fuel industry, according to a report earlier this month. Though the data is incomplete, a Credit Suisse preliminary estimate suggests it achieved a 64% reduction over a two-year period, 2021 and 2022. Both banks use a 2020 baseline.

Part of the reason for Credit Suisse’s higher overall emissions is a function of its larger investment bank. UBS, having accepted a bailout from the Swiss government in 2008, made major cuts in investment banking in 2012 and retreated from capital-intensive trading businesses to focus on asset and wealth management.

That approach has meant fewer financed emissions for UBS relative to larger investment banks. It also probably means UBS now has less clout in pressing borrowers on their emissions-reduction plans. “You can probably do more to influence climate action and the energy transition by hanging on to the capital markets and lending businesses,” said Harald Walkate, former head of environmental, social and governance investing at Natixis Investment Managers who’s now a senior fellow at the University of Zurich’s Center for Sustainable Finance.

To be sure, among European-based lenders, Credit Suisse had a so-called energy-supply banking ratio of 1.0 in 2021. This means it helped finance as much in clean-energy projects as fossil fuels, according to researchers at BloombergNEF. That ratio was better than rivals including HSBC Holdings Plc, Societe Generale AG and ING Groep NV.

That said, Credit Suisse hasn’t been doing enough to push for change, according to UK nonprofit ShareAction, which last year helped coordinate a shareholder resolution calling for the bank to devise and publish a robust plan for reducing its financing of fossil fuels.

Just last week ShareAction said the bank’s oil and gas policy is “one of the weakest” in the European banking sector.

For an enlarged UBS, its approach to emissions enabled from lending and debt underwriting will be critical to its future success, said James Vaccaro, who leads the Climate Safe Lending Network.“The degree to which they show real leadership on climate and sustainability may determine how quickly they can build trust,” he said.

Regulators in Asia issued reassuring statements Monday that their banking systems remained robust and stable after Swiss banking giant UBS agreed to buy its rival Credit Suisse for $3.25 billion. Swiss regulators played a key role in orchestrating the forced takeover, to stem a larger banking crisis that would threaten the global system. The deal was announced before markets opened Monday. Last week, Credit Suisse logged its worst weekly decline since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The developments come shortly after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which led to U.S. regulators backstopping SVB's uninsured deposits and offering new funding for troubled banks. The slew of headlines around the global banking turmoil have heightened volatility and investor fears of a broader crisis.

Hong Kong says industry is resilient

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said the city's banking sector is resilient with strong capital and liquidity positions. Credit Suisse's operations in the city comprise a branch supervised by the HKMA and two licensed corporations supervised by the Securities and Futures Commission. ""All of them will open for business today as usual. Customers can continue to access their deposits with the branch and trading services provided by Credit Suisse for Hong Kong's stock and derivatives markets,"" HKMA said.

""The total assets of Credit Suisse, Hong Kong Branch amounted to about HK$100 billion, representing less than 0.5% of the total assets of the Hong Kong banking sector. The exposures of the local banking sector to Credit Suisse are insignificant,"" it added. As of the end of February 2023, Credit Suisse was the ninth-largest listed structured product issuer in Hong Kong, accounting for about 4% of the total market in terms of market value of outstanding units, HKMA said.

In a similar move, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said Credit Suisse operations will continue in the city-state with ""no interruptions or restrictions."" Credit Suisse customers will continue to have full access to their accounts and ""contracts with counterparties remain in force. The takeover is not expected to have an impact on the stability of Singapore's banking system,"" MAS said. MAS added that UBS and Credit Suisse do not serve retail customers, as their primary activities in Singapore are in private banking and investment banking. The central bank said it will remain in close contact with Swiss regulators, UBS and Credit Suisse as ""the takeover is executed, to facilitate an orderly transition, including addressing any impact on employment.""

Japan banks 'shielded'

As for Japan, the country's banking system is unlikely to be affected by the deal, said Cyrus Daruwala, managing director of IDC Financial Services. ""I think the exposure to a large wealth manager or an asset manager like Credit Suisse or UBS, in general speaking terms, would be approximately 4% of their portfolio,"" Daruwala, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Monday.

That is not ""a significant amount"" he added. ""Japan, I maintain has been relatively shielded, especially from Credit Suisse.""

Big U.S. banks may also be winners, analysts say","UBS ' acquisition of Credit Suisse could lead to big gains for the Swiss bank. Some banks in the U.S. could also benefit from it, according to analysts. UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs, or around $3.2 billion, in a forced deal announced Sunday. The Swiss National Bank pledged to lend up to 100 billion Swiss francs, or $108 billion, to support the takeover, while the Swiss government also guaranteed it would assume losses up to 9 billion Swiss francs from certain assets over a preset time period to reduce risks to UBS. The deal has left Wall Street to figure out how the marriage of two globally important financial giants will reverberate throughout a global industry that's already on uneasy footing coming off the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. For UBS shareholders, Bank of America analyst Alastair Ryan said, the deal could be good long term. He upgraded UBS' U.S.-listed shares to buy from neutral, citing potential cost synergies by combining two Switzerland-centric banks. Ryan also increased his price target to $24.81 from $22.65. His new target implies the stock could rally 36.3%. ""The industrial logic is impeccable: CS was the closest competitor to UBS in wealth management and Switzerland; and both banks are heavy in Swiss central costs,"" he said in a Monday note to clients. As part of the deal, Credit Suisse shareholders receive 1 UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares they hold. While Jefferies analyst Flora Bocahut said the deal itself could be beneficial for shareholders on paper, the onus is now on UBS to execute. Still, she called the deal positive considering alternatives included a nationalization or unwinding of Credit Suisse that would have increased risks to the broader sector. ""We think the objective of this transaction, while solving CS' situation & associated risks for the system, is to reach a win/win, where UBS shareholders also get value out of this deal over time,"" she said in a note to clients Sunday. ""However, UBS embarks significant execution risk, litigation risk, the buyback is temporarily suspended (unclear how long), UBS' capital requirement is likely to be revised up, and management focus will be captured by this deal for many quarters, maybe years."" 'Goliath is winning' Others are questioning how the broader industry will fare — and have varied outlooks. Goldman Sachs chief credit strategist Lotfi Karoui moved his view of European banks back to overweight following the deal in a Sunday note to clients. ""On Friday, we argued that the performance of the broader European banking sector would remain pressured until clarity is provided on Credit Suisse's future path and recommended moving to a neutral allocation on banks in the EUR market (from overweight previously),"" Karoui said. ""Today's outcome provides such clarity."" Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs chief European economist Sven Jari Stehn said the bank crisis has made the firm expect the European Central Bank to hike interest rates by 25 basis points in May compared with a 50 basis-point increase expected before the financial sector challenges began. While the firm expects the Bank of England to hike rates by 25 basis points at its next meeting, Stehn said to no longer expect another interest rate increase in May. But Barclays analyst Amit Goel wasn't so sure, cutting his view on European banks to neutral from positive on Monday. Goel said he's more optimistic on banks in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and the Netherlands compared with Switzerland, with preferred global equities including BNP Paribas, ABN AMRO Bank, HSBC and Lloyds Bank . ""Recent events again go to show how fragile the banking system can be, even though regulation has increased several fold since the Global Financial Crisis,"" Goel said. ""Following recent events we expect broader sector cost of equity to remain elevated for some time, and liquidity requirements to be revisited."" Within the U.S., investors are continuing to weigh the risk of contagion within the sector, specifically watching regional banks. First Republic Bank lost more than 70% of its share value last week despite a group of banks saying it would aid First Republic with $30 billion in deposits. Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala said stock prices could stabilize if investors gain confidence that the deposit flight out of regional banks has been contained. Elsewhere, Poonawala noted investors will be watching the Federal Reserve policy meeting this week to see if the central bank goes through with an expected interest rate hike of 25 basis points. Wells Fargo's Mike Mayo, meanwhile, sees opportunity for U.S. banks coming out of the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse. Calling the deal proof that ""Goliath is winning,"" he said U.S. banks may have an opening with the deal not slated to close until the end of the year. ""To us, this merger further displays that the largest U.S. capital players can continue to gain global market share, as they've done for the past decade,"" Mayo said. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",['Alex Harring'],2023-03-20 00:00:00

https://nypost.com/2023/04/14/islanders-to-face-hurricanes-in-stanley-cup-playoffs/,Islanders get best-case scenario with Hurricanes in first round of playoffs,"The Islanders know their first-round opponent.

The Hurricanes’ 6-4 victory over the Panthers on Thursday night kept Florida out of the top wild-card spot, so the Islanders will start the playoffs on Monday or Tuesday in Raleigh, N.C., against Carolina.

Since the other option — if the Panthers had won Thursday — was facing the record-setting Bruins, this was the best-case scenario for the Islanders, but it is still far from a simple task.

The Hurricanes finished the regular season atop the Metropolitan Division with a 52-21-9 record, and they defeated the Islanders in three of four games between the teams. The Islanders’ only victory came on Oct. 28, a 6-2 rout at Carolina. The Hurricanes won 3-0 and 5-2 in the two games at UBS Arena, and recorded a 2-1 victory on April 2 in Raleigh.

After the Islanders clinched a playoff spot with a win over the Canadiens in their final game of the regular season on Wednesday, the prevailing mood in the dressing room was that it didn’t matter who they played, the Bruins or the Hurricanes.

“We’ll just prepare for whoever we have to prepare for when we find out,” coach Lane Lambert said.

The coaching staff will have their work cut out for it against the battle-tested Hurricanes, who boast the NHL’s second-ranked defense in per-game goal prevention and have a deep, fast lineup capable of forechecking teams into oblivion.

As far as statistical disparities go, the biggest one heading into the best-of-seven series is likely the Islanders’ power play, which is ranked 31st in the league and will need to solve a Carolina penalty kill that finished the season behind only Boston in success rate.

At even strength, though, there are a few factors that could give the Islanders some confidence. Mainly, goaltender Ilya Sorokin’s sustained excellence in net, which could easily steal them a game or two.

There also is the reality of the situation in which the Islanders have found themselves for nearly the entire second half of the season, in which just about every game was a must-win in a playoff dogfight. The actual playoffs are still a different animal, but having had so much on the line recently should help, along with the fact that the physical and heavy style the Islanders prefer is fit for postseason hockey.

“I think it gives you a little bit of feel for where you’re heading and what it’s gonna be like,” Lambert said. “Certainly, it’s a new season. But I think it can pay dividends. We fought through a lot of adversity at different times this year.”

The biggest question for the Islanders regards the status of center Mathew Barzal, who has a suspected knee injury, and defenseman Alexander Romanov (upper-body injury), both of whom have been skating on their own while rehabbing.

If Barzal can return to play alongside Bo Horvat on the top line, and Romanov can come back into the top-four, it could completely change the dynamic of the series. The Islanders played just six full games with Barzal and Horvat together in the lineup this season.

By Danilo Masoni and Samuel Indyk

MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - European exchange stocks stand to benefit from a spike in volatility surrounding the downfall of Credit Suisse, as some investors turn towards bourse operators attracted by their defensive qualities and modest valuations.

The exchanges' share price performance has lagged the region-wide STOXX 600 index by up to 13 percentage points since September, as investors chased banks, potentially a more attractive trade because of rising interest rates.

But after a quiet start to the year for trading activity, the turbulence in March is spurring some investors to shift their exposure as part of a wider shift away from banking into other sectors.

Spikes in bond and equity volatility could yield positive earning surprises for exchange companies during the upcoming reporting season, just when tightening credit conditions risk hitting economic growth, making defensive businesses like exchanges more attractive.

Exchange operators' shares have outperformed in the past few weeks, with traders and analysts pointing to signs of investors rotating into exchanges, partly at the expense of banks. Volume spikes tend to boost activity across trades processed by exchange operators.

""There's rotation, the most obvious and public example of this is in the price action,"" said Andrew Morgan, president at U.S.-based financial technology provider TS Imagine.

""Exchange operators are data and technology businesses with defensive utility-like features, while banks are highly cyclical and exposed to idiosyncratic business model risks"".

Equity trades across Euronext, which runs exchanges in seven big European centres from Paris to Amsterdam and Milan, reached the third-highest value in the company's history on March 17. Its average daily traded volumes in March were the highest in a year.

Swiss exchange SIX, at the epicentre of the turmoil around UBS's rescue of Credit Suisse, had a 44.6% jump in March turnover compared with February. Cash market turnover at Deutsche Boerse rose 23.7% last month versus February.

Average daily value traded at the London Stock Exchange (LSEG) rose 12.9% month-over-month in March. Thomson Reuters, which owns Reuters News, has been a shareholder in LSEG since 2021. LSEG also pays Reuters for news.

VOLATILITY BOOST

Evidence of any shift could be revealed when filings disclosing how mutual funds have tweaked their positions are published in a few weeks' time.

UBS research that uses the bank's prime brokerage data and other sources showed in April that investor ""crowding"" in exchange operators' stocks has been recovering from four-year lows.

Among financials in Europe, exchange stocks are the most positively correlated to volatility.

Banking turmoil and option expiries drove the Euro STOXX volatility index last month to its highest since October in a steep surge that quickly pared back. The MOVE index, a gauge of fixed-income volatility, hit 2008 levels and remains high.

""Investors tend to look at the exchanges as defensive names. In recessionary environments, we tend to see money being allocated increasingly to the exchanges,"" said Micheal Werner, senior equity analyst at UBS in London.

""The number of incoming calls I have had on the exchanges has certainly increased over the past two or three weeks as people are working at the allocations within the financial space of their portfolio,"" he added.

Werner said uncertainty over monetary policy should keep bond volatility elevated, supporting exchange stocks, while spikes in equity volatility tend to be bad for investment banking, M&A and customer fund flows at big universal banks.

Deutsche Boerse has rallied more than 10% since the bank turmoil started in March with the collapse of U.S. regional bank SVB. Deutsche Boerse shares hit a lifetime high on Thursday.

LSEG and Euronext have risen almost 8% and 4% respectively, while Amsterdam-based market maker Flow Traders, which also benefits from volatility, is up more than 13%.

Over the same period, European banks have lost around 12%.

Looking to the long term, some investors see the exchange industry benefiting from data demand.

And exchange valuations are near multi-year lows which suggests any downside could be limited.

Euronext trades at 14 times 12-month forward earnings and LSEG at 22 times, both an 18% discount to their five-year averages, as per Refinitiv Datastream.

U.S. rival Nasdaq Inc trades on a multiple of 20, just a 3% discount to its 5-year average and Intercontinental Exchange Inc which trades on a multiple of 19, is 4.7% below its 5-year average.

""Beyond being volatility beneficiaries, which makes them attractive within a diversified portfolio context, we also believe they are well-placed for data demand and consumption trends,"" said Thomas McGarrity, head of equities at RBC Wealth Management. ""We continue to like exchange stocks.""

Daniel L. Florness

Thank you, Taylor, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to the first quarter Fastenal earnings conference call. The -- this call is a little different for Holden and I today because we're at the site of our customer expo that just finished up yesterday. And really pleased with the event. A lot of great customer engagement. One thing nice about the event this year is some of the natural things that were occurring, obviously, 2 and 3 years ago, we didn't have an event because of COVID. Last year, we had an event, but we had to limit the attendance and also because of international travel, we had to limit the attendance. This year, we didn't have those restrictions, so we had a great event.

And there were four areas of focus to the theme of the event this year. One was continuing to accelerate our customers' digital transformation to give them better visibility to what is happening inside their four walls, inside their facilities. The second one was really securing their supply chain. The world has seen a lot of change and a lot of impacts to supply chains over the last several years and really allowing our customers the opportunity to think about their supply chains continually in a more strategic way as we move forward.

The third was power and productivity. A lot of this digital transformation, understanding the elements of your supply chain. It's also about bringing productivity to your -- whether it's your production floor or some element of your operation, we provide the tools to do that. And then the fourth piece was understanding our customers' goals and sharing with them ways that we can serve their goals when it comes to their journey in ESG. And I think those four points resonated well throughout the event.

Now moving on to the quarter. So first quarter, we had earnings per share of $0.52, an increase of 10.5% over last year. The team had really strong expense management during the quarter and pleased with the incremental margin we were able to produce despite the fact that as you saw in our monthly numbers, the March daily sales came in a bit softer. We're in now our fifth month of ISM below 50% and it had ticked down in March. And we're seeing that in our business, particularly in the fastener side, the OEM piece of the business. And -- but despite that, really impressed with our team's ability to manage through it.

As is -- as we've talked about in prior years, we've done a really nice job of managing pieces of our business if we compare to pre-COVID and post-COVID. And I'm sorry for that beeping in the background. My laptop's here and -- but if you look at operating costs as a percentage of sales, in the first quarter of 2019, operating costs were 27.8% of sales. In the first quarter of 2023, they were 24.6%. And it's really about all the changes we've made to the organization. A, our average branch is larger today than ones back in 2019. More of our business is coming from Onsite. We've done a nice job of digitizing our business to bring efficiencies to it, and you see that shining through.

The other piece is as we understand better our engagement with our customer and their needs, and as supply chains have improved globally, we've also been able to not only lower our days on hand of inventory from what we were seeing 1 year ago as we -- in 6 months ago, as we deepened our inventory but where our business was prepandemic. So we've taken about 3 weeks' worth of inventory out of the network over that entire time frame and really impressed with our team's ability to do that.

Finally, if you manage your business well, manage your expenses well, managing your working capital well, it's a distribution business, you see that show up in your cash flow. So our operating cash flow was $389 million, which was 132% of earnings and was 70% higher than a year ago. And so about $160 million of additional operating cash that we generated in the quarter. Our CapEx -- net CapEx, is very similar in both periods. So a very strong free cash flow, which puts us in a position to invest in the business or return to our shareholders. And we continued that pattern and was able to pay out a nice dividend in the first quarter. And then last night, we just announced the second quarter dividend, and -- of about $200 million a quarter, we're paying out right now in dividends.

Moving to Page 4 of the [foot] book. So Onsite, we signed 89 in the quarter. Active sites finished at 1,674, so about a 16% increase from first quarter last year. If you ignore the transferred sales that come from the branch when we open an Onsite, our Onsite business grew about 20% Q1 to Q1, so strong performance. We remain steadfast in our intention to sign 375 to 400 Onsites this year. Number was a little bit weaker in the first quarter, and most of that we saw in March. And -- but when I think of the engagement going on at the event here the last several days, I feel good about where we're going to be in the next 6 months.

If I look at FMI technology, an incredibly strong performance by the team this quarter. We've talked in the past about this idea of we build infrastructure to support 100 signings per day. And during COVID, our numbers dropped from the upper 70s, low 80s neighborhood as we build up towards that ability to sign 100 a day. We dropped down in the 60s. And it's slowly -- start our way back. Last year, in the first quarter, we signed 83 a day. This year, in the first quarter, we signed 92 per day. In the month of March, we signed 99 per day. So really strong performance by the team. And you can see that continuing to expand in our platform. Our FMI for the quarter was 39.4%. In the month of March, we broke 40% for the first time ever. And really pleased, and we feel good about our goal of signing between 23,000 and 25,000 for the year.

As we've seen in prior quarters, we continue to see really strong growth in e-commerce. Recall that last fall, that broke 20% of revenue for the first time. I believe this quarter, we're at about 22%. And then finally, if you roll all those pieces together, our digital footprint came in at 54% of sales versus 47% a year ago. And in the month of May -- March, excuse me, we hit 55%. And our goal is to drive that to 65% later in the year. Time will tell if we're able to accomplish that with a long-term goal of -- we believe that number is about 85% of our business is going through some type of digital footprint.

With that, I'll turn it over to Holden.

Holden Lewis

Great. Thank you, Dan. Before diving into the details of the quarter on Slide 5, I wanted to build a little bit on Dan's earlier comments in his prepared remarks to offer a little bit of perspective on the overall state of our business.

If you recall, simultaneous with the onset of the pandemic in 2020, Fastenal accelerated its technology deployment and shifted the structure and priorities of our sales effort. Those actions are adversely affecting short-term sales, though we continue to grow our Onsite and FMI basis as well as our Digital Footprint penetration, and we continue to achieve historical levels of market outgrowth. This also adds an incremental annual mix-related gross margin pressure.

However, those changes need to be weighed against the benefits of the rest of our business. Relative to the prepandemic business, we have begun to generate meaningful labor productivity and reduced the cost footprint of our facilities. As a result, the incremental margin from the first quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2023 of 24% is appreciably greater than what we saw from the first quarter of '15 to the first quarter of '19 of 16.2%, and we've improved our capacity for leverage over time. At the same time, from the first quarter of '19 to the first quarter of '23, our inventory days have declined from 175 to 154 days despite inflation and supply chain disruption. And our receivables days have fallen from 56 to 55 days despite growth in our national accounts mix.

The Blue Team has sharpened our differentiation in the marketplace while sustainably improving the leverageability of our cost structure and lowering our asset intensity. We're a stronger, more productive business today than we were prior to the pandemic, and that is very clear in these first quarter 2023 results. So let's jump into those.

Daily sales increased 9.1% in the first quarter of 2023. February storms had a modest 20 to 40 basis point negative impact, while currency was a 70 basis point drag. There are several other items affecting sales. First, pricing continues to moderate. It contributed 290 to 320 basis points to growth in the period, down approximately 290 basis points from the first quarter of 2022 and down approximately 60 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022. This trend is not a surprise and will likely continue through 2023.

Second, we continue to see weakness in several major retailer customers, our international business and our construction and reseller businesses. These dynamics are unchanged since the third quarter of 2022. Our retailer customers have tightened their belts with respect to facilities and labor, which also affected our non-North American business, along with a strong dollar in geopolitical events. Softer construction reflects the conscious decision we made to position our branches to focus on larger key accounts, which is contributing to better labor leverage.

Third, manufacturing and large accounts continue to perform strongly, reflecting investments in Onsite and changes to our branch structure and sales roles. Even so, we did see a downshift in broader market activity in March as represented by slower DSR growth of 6.8%, including just 2.3% daily growth in fasteners.

Now 1 month does not make a trend. It's too early to have a good read on April and we don't have a lot of forward visibility. We do continue to anticipate that we will outgrow our marketplace, which frankly isn't growing right now. However, the quarter did finish on a softer note.

Now to Slide 6. Operating margin in the first quarter of 2023 was 20.2%, up from 20% in the prior year. The incremental margin -- incremental operating margin was 22.7%. Gross margin was 45.7%, down 80 basis points from the prior year. This decline is entirely due to product and customer mix as we experienced widening sales growth outperformance of non-fasteners or fasteners and Onsites over non-Onsites. Price/cost was still negative year-over-year, but narrowed meaningfully versus the fourth quarter. The remaining gap is largely in our other products category, where pricing actions in the first quarter of 2023 only went into place in February while in fasteners lower costing eliminated the negative price/cost we experienced in the second half of 2022.

GAAP expenses were higher with inbound shipments declining as we adjusted our stocking to reflect a smoother supply chain. And then on the other side of the ledger, contribution to margin from freight was better than anticipated. We saw annual and sequential declines in both container costs and containers purchased on the import side and record freight revenues allowed for good leverage of our captive fleet expenses. These dynamics are likely to persist for the next couple of quarters.

On the operating expense side, we generated 20 basis points of leverage from occupancy costs as branch closings over the past 12 months produced a slightly lower facility expense. We generated 80 basis points of leverage from payroll expenses. Total incentive pay for the company in the first quarter of 2023 was the second highest on record for our first quarter. However, with pretax growth in the first quarter of 2023 being roughly 1/3 of the pretax growth in the first quarter of 2022, total incentive pay for the company was down high single digits. Other operating expenses benefited from lower bad debt costs, lower selling-related transportation costs and higher profits from asset sales which was largely offset by higher costs for IT, general insurance and sales-related travel. Putting it all together, we reported first quarter 2023 EPS of $0.52, up over 10% from $0.47 in the first quarter of 2022.

Now turning to Slide 7. We generated $389 million in operating cash in the first quarter of 2023, or approximately 132% of net income in the period. I'll provide a bit more color in a moment, but this improvement in our conversion rate reflects working capital swinging from a significant use of cash in the first quarter of 2022 to a source of cash in the first quarter of 2023. This strong cash flow allowed us to reduce debt in the period, putting net debt at 10.9% in the first quarter of 2023, up slightly from 10.4% in the first quarter of 2022, but down from 14.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Year-over-year, accounts receivable was up 7.3% on higher customer demand and an increase in the mix of larger key account customers, which tend to have longer terms. And this was partly offset by an improvement in receivables quality. Inventories rose 3.2%. Inflation was not a material contributor to inflation growth in the period. Further, as indicated earlier, normalization of global supply chains is allowing us to unwind the layer of inventory that we intentionally built up in late 2021 and early 2022 to manage what had been significant product bottlenecks. We believe the process of rightsizing inventory will continue through 2023 with additional releases of cash as the year progresses.

Net capital spending in the first quarter of 2023 was approximately $31 million. Our range for net capital spending in 2023 remains $210 million to $230 million, and our first quarter spending being behind that pace reflects timing of expenditures. Over the course of 2023, we expect higher spending on hub investments, fleet equipment and IT equipment.

With that, operator, we'll turn it over to you for questions and answers.

Question and Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Chris Dankert with Loop Capital Markets.

Christopher M. Dankert

I guess, first off, thinking about conversations with RVPs right now. How do they feel about adding FTEs or kind of management there? Just how are we thinking about labor management today and growth kind of going forward?

Holden Lewis

We've talked about labor management, the RVPs really coming into this year. And the premise was when you look at where the PMI is, when you look at the trend in industrial production, we need to be looking forward and really have a plan to be cautious about hiring.

Now in January and February, I'll tell you that demand grew pretty healthy, and I think that we added people sort of related to that. In March, obviously, we called out, the demand softened a little bit. I would also point out that our hiring adds softened a little bit in March as well. We've always talked about how we can react fairly quickly to changes that we're seeing.

And so the message to the field has been, you have to be prepared to adjust for a down shift in demand. And again, that's not a message we just conveyed. We entered the year having that same conversation. And I think that they have been really responding by adding resources where they need to add it. By adding the right resources, we continue to see the mix of part-timers growing in the overall piece of our business, right? Where we've added full-timers, a significant portion of those were made in India, right?

So I think that the organization is focused on the right metrics to understand what they need to be doing from a labor standpoint. I think they're executing on that. And I was encouraged that as demand slowed down in March, so did the sort of the hiring adds. So I think we're doing the right things.

Christopher M. Dankert

That's great color. And then again, just thinking about the CSP growth seems to be lagging a bit more relative to the rest of the business here. Does that change any of the calculus around the pace of closures there or kind of how you're positioning the business from a channel approach perspective?

Holden Lewis

By CSP growth, what are you referring to?

Christopher M. Dankert

Just the nonnational accounts piece of the business, obviously under growing national accounts and Onsite. I guess my assumption is that most of that is the more traditional branches, correct?

Holden Lewis

So remember that our traditional branches are -- they support not only the local businesses that you're referring to, but they do support the national accounts business as well. But yes, I think you're referring to the nonnational accounts sector on our release. So thank you for that clarification.

The -- when you think about what's happening in sort of the construction, the reseller, traditionally, there's been a lot of smaller customers there, right? I mean what confused me is when you talked about CSP, right, CSP was our old stocking model that we began to unwind a few years ago. That CSP was intended to draw in that smaller local construction customer, provide them a high degree of service in the local market and things of that nature. And our priorities in the branch have shifted a little bit, trying to move that customer online and creating a sort of time to focus on some of those larger customers in the market.

And I can't say that I'm surprised by what we're seeing. I think that the relative weakness you see in construction relative to manufacturing, which, again, is part of what we're trying to achieve, I think that, that is really -- those that's really related to the difference you're seeing in the national accounts versus the nonnational accounts growth as well. So I think those things are all related. Does that get to your question?

Christopher M. Dankert

That does. That makes it ton of sense. I'll leave it there.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.

Stephen Edward Volkmann

Can I just pull on that thread slightly one more time, Holden. How long do you think that transition takes in the construction-type business where you sort of move away from some of these smaller customers? I assume that's a process that lasts 1 year or 2, I don't know. How long do you think that goes on?

Holden Lewis

I don't love the phrase move away from those type of customers. The truth is we're trying to service them through a different model, but setting aside the semantic. I suspect just looking at how that cadence has played out in the preceding, call it, 15 months, I suspect that we'll probably have some softness in that area. That transition period will probably last the bulk of this year.

I think as we get into Q4 and into next year, I think you begin to sort of lap those comps. And I think we're probably in a position where it doesn't represent the drag on our business that it does today.

So I think you're right to look at it as a transition because I think that's what it is. And once we lap that transition, I think the growth that you're seeing today in those manufacturing customers and those large customers, that's going to really begin to shine as we sort of work through that transition over the next 2 or 3 quarters.

Daniel L. Florness

Also, if you think of the chart we've shared in January of each of the last several years, we talk about branch consolidations, we're near the end of that process. So if you think about -- if you think just about our customer segments, so the customer where we're highly engaged from a Digital Footprint perspective, we are their supply chain partner. Those customers rarely, if ever, come into one of our facilities. They probably don't even know where we're located.

And so if you're in a market and you consolidate a few locations, you are actually moving further away from this other segment of customer. And so if you look at where we get to that ultimate branch count, we're probably a year away of being at that point. And that ties right into Holden's comment as well.

Holden Lewis

Yes. And so looping that back to Chris' comment earlier, pardon the pun, I failed to mention that. I mean that's another reason why those smaller customers have been relatively weaker as well because a lot of times when you go to that branch consolidation, Dan indicated, that's the customer that no longer is visiting that location that would have otherwise been there. So that's an element of that as well.

Stephen Edward Volkmann

Right. Got it. Yes. Apologies for the semantics, I was struggling for something better unsuccessfully. But can I switch slightly. When you talk about some of the deceleration that you're seeing, it's kind of an interesting dynamic. Do you have visibility? Do you think your customers are destocking because the supply chains are now better and so that might be part of what we're seeing? Or do you think it's actual sort of end market slowdown?

And the other overlay that's interesting is that you would think that production rates would actually kind of go up at your customers as supply chains normalize rather than down. So I'm just curious if you have any visibility into any of that, and then I'll pass it on.

Holden Lewis

Yes. So the feedback from the regionals was really touched on both things that you brought up, Steve. One is they did talk about how as supply chains normalize, you're seeing suppliers of product begin to shave back their production simply because their customers can now -- they may have tried to hold extra product, and now they can sort of back that up a little bit. So there's an element of adjusting to the supply chain.

But I also did get a number of comments from regionals that they're also seeing our customers just tightened their wallets a bit, both in terms of capital spending as well as operating expenses. And so I think there's a little bit of both of those things, those dynamics playing out.

Daniel L. Florness

The other piece I'll -- up from an insite perspective, if you think about our business from a product line and product use perspective, if I go back to January, so OEM fasteners is 20%, 22% of our revenue, kind of low 20s. That business was growing around 13.5% in January. In March, it grew 7%. So that is production dropping off. If I contrast that with safety, for example, our safety business grew stronger in March than it did in January.

Now I honestly haven't given that -- I've been now at the show over the last few days. I don't know if there was a comp issue because some of the safety was being pushed around a little bit because of some COVID activity. But that's a case of -- that business has been -- it fell off a little bit in February. That, I know, was a comp issue with last year. But I don't believe January and March had a comp issue. I think that ties a bit into the strength we're seeing in our pending deployment.

If I look at remaining products, that did also fall off a little bit, and there'll be some production in those as well, particularly in the metal working.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of David Manthey with Baird.

Daniel L. Florness

Dave, if you're talking, you are on mute.

Operator

And moving on, our next question is from the line of Ken Newman of KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Kenneth H. Newman

Holden, I'm curious if you could just talk a little bit more on the fastener sales trends in March. Obviously, a bigger sequential slowdown here and the comp for April looks pretty similar. I guess, two minor questions here. One, I guess, should we assume that the fastener volumes were negative in the month? And two, how do we think about the net margin impact of that part of the portfolio since I think it's typically accretive to mix, but you also called out lower shipping container costs?

Holden Lewis

Yes. With regards to sort of the volume side versus the price side, the -- I'm trying to think.

Daniel L. Florness

By line, it was slightly negative.

Holden Lewis

It would be. It would be. So I think that that's an element. And again, it's our most cyclical line. Dan referenced sort of the commentary about the OEM fasteners in particular. I mean today, OEM fasteners represent about 62% of our fastener business. And so when you get a slowdown of some sort in a period, it's going to affect the volumes in the fastener side of the business.

Now you're right, it tends to be a higher margin line. And so to the degree that fasteners grow slower than the rest, that does have an adverse mix impact. I think that's always been the case, cycle to cycle. It's something we talk a lot about, about sort of mix impact.

Daniel L. Florness

When the falloff is in the OEM fastener component of the fasteners, the mix impact is different than if it's in the MRO piece. Could see the OEM fasteners do not have a higher gross margin than our overall company gross margin. The MRO fasteners do.

Kenneth H. Newman

That's helpful color. Got it. And then I guess for my follow-up here, I'm curious if you -- I mean, last quarter, you talked maybe the need to renegotiate pricing with some of your big vendors because of steel prices as well as transportation costs. You've obviously -- you talked a little bit about transportation easing a bit, but I think the prices have also kind of stayed in here in recent months. I'm curious if you have any update on the color for price/cost negotiations on higher steel material?

Daniel L. Florness

We are acutely aware of steel pricing and shipping costs. And that's our covenant with our customer. We're going to find the best quality, best price, best reliability supply chain for their business. There are always robust conversations going on.

But we also operate in a very dynamic marketplace. So we've been seeing fastener prices stabilize for a number of months now. We're seeing that come through in our cost of goods. And that also helps our gross margin in the short term because we're seeing -- we were getting squeezed a little bit 6 and 9 months ago. A little bit of that squeezing is lessening right now, and you're seeing that sign through in our numbers as well.

Holden Lewis

And I think those conversations -- I think we've always talked about how our objective was to talk to those customers that have the timing of our costing and we understood, as Dan said, we have a covenant to sort of adjust as appropriate. I think our customers have been great working with us to understand when our product is going to be coming through at a lower cost, et cetera.

And so we've always kind of felt that as you get to that second quarter. There'll probably be more activity around that and adjustments to be made. I still think that that's probably the case that those are sort of second quarter, third quarter type activities. But again, what you should be getting a sense of is we're trying to time any decline that we may have to have in pricing to our customers with the declines that we see in costing.

And so I certainly understand the concern. But again, we -- I think we've done a good job sort of matching price and cost. I think that the team has done a great job on this side of the cycle as well. And the objective is to be price/cost neutral.

Operator

Our next questions come from the line of David Manthey with Baird.

David John Manthey

Yes. In relation to that -- to the prior answer, that's exactly what I wanted to have you discuss, just the general pricing methodology of how you're trying to match your customer pricing relative to the actual COGS in your supply chain versus front-running any price increase or I guess, lagging a price decline. And you addressed it to a large extent, but I just want to be clear on that. Your container prices are down, steel prices are up a little bit, and you're saying that fastener prices are mostly stable today. So you're not anticipating any major changes as we look at 2023 as we sit here today?

Holden Lewis

As we sit here today, I would say no. We're not. Again, we -- that we might need to adjust pricing is not a surprise. We know where that would have to happen (inaudible). Again, we have pretty good visibility in our costing. And so we really do try to align those two things.

And so as you know, we really didn't have a point through the period of inflation where our pricing was ahead of our costing, and that was deliberate. As you got towards the flip side of that cycle, we actually got a little bit behind from a price/cost standpoint just because as much pricing as we put through to respond to the marketplace, it just wasn't quite enough given how dramatic the sort of the cost side was.

And all is we're seeing -- so as we talked about 2 quarters ago, we started talking about 2 quarters ago, we wound up having negative price cost on the fastener side. And we anticipated at the time that costing would catch up to our pricing, and that's largely where we got to this quarter. But going forward, the idea is to -- and this is a conversation we've been very explicitly having with customers. There will be cases where we have to reduce the price based on the variables you talked about, but we should be able to largely track that with our costing.

Daniel L. Florness

If you break our business into three components, Dave, to Holden's point, on the fastener side, I think we've done a really nice job managing through it. Part of the lumpiness to it, it was -- some of the changes were pretty extreme.

If I look at safety, we have great visibility to demand. Over half of that business is going through a vending device. So you really understand that business, and we've been able to manage through that quite well. We did adjust some pricing here in the -- as Holden touched on, during the quarter on our remaining product lines because there, we probably weren't -- we were putting so much attention on the half of our business that's fasteners and safety, and we were probably not as focused on the other half of the business as we should have been and we did some corrections there. So we did raise some prices on the non-fastener, non-safety piece during the quarter.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.

Nigel Edward Coe

I know the freight is quite small portion of revenues, but you called out the growth of 14% or so. Obviously, very good margin. So just wondering, given where LTL tonnage is trending right now, how -- what did you do to kind of get that kind of growth rate? And it sounds like you expecting this to continue going forward. So just wondering what's driving that kind of growth?

Daniel L. Florness

I think sometimes you can be guilty of over time of -- you focus on -- there's enough energy in the room to focus on a handful of things. And sometimes things fall off that focus. I would say if anything, we were probably a little bit guilty of that in recent years on the freight side of the equation. And part of that, I'll attribute it to me from the standpoint of what are the things you talk about, what are the things you push focus on.

And when things get really chaotic, sometimes you have to pivot and say, hey, folks, we need to put some energy into this because this is a we problem that we need to fix. And so it's more of a case of I'd say we're probably reverting to some of the freight pricing habits that we had 3 and 4 years ago that were maybe a little bit waning in the last several years. And COVID and all the other distractions of life came into play.

The other element to it is while we lost some focus on our ability to charge for freight, we have really good at using our own trucks from moving freight. So we have those two dynamics going on. We're probably back to where we should be on what we're charging out and we've improved on how much goes through our own network, and that's a nice one-two punch.

Holden Lewis

And I think there's -- I mean there's a number of things factoring in today, some of which are long-term sustainable and some of which are sort of in the here and now. But we've alluded a couple of times to an increase in plant spend. As more plant spend becomes a bigger portion of our business, it becomes easier for us to plan our own logistics, right?

And so we have seen our third-party freight go down, in part because of that trend. I think that's going to continue. We did or at least are in the process of executing some route consolidation and some rescheduling of routes, which I think will bring some efficiencies into the business, not just the ongoing continuous improvement of the business that I think will be sustainable.

What you're referring to, though, is important because as our revenues have gone up as the [SME] focus there, the cost structure of our semis fleet is fairly stable. And so as revenues go up, we actually leveraged that fairly well.

The other piece in this quarter that occurred though is, one, container costs are down a lot. And that was a benefit. I think down something like 75% year-over-year. So that was a benefit. I would also point out that our container flow is down a lot this quarter because of the things we're doing to sort of unwind some inventory. And so our container flow in the first quarter was also down 50%.

Now I think those latter two issues, they're not necessarily long-term issues, that's adjusting to sort of things that appeared in the last couple of years. I do think that they'll last for the next couple of quarters. But things like the plant spend, lower third-party freight, route consolidation, those sorts of things, I think those are going to continue to improve the business.

The big variable will be demand, right? Because our freight revenues aren't different than our other revenues. If activity levels begin to drop, then freight revenue dollars may come in and then that stable cost base could work against you. And so I think demand is an open question there. But from an execution standpoint, there's some great things going on with freight in the organization.

Nigel Edward Coe

Yes. No, that's great. And then just a quick one. We talked about the March sales now at some length. But you called out weather impact in February. You didn't call out anything in March, but some companies are blaming weather in March. So I'm just wondering were there any weather impacts that could maybe explain some of the weakness you saw towards the back end of the month?

Holden Lewis

No. We've tried to raise our threshold of pain that we bought at a mentioned. Can I find you an RVP that think there was some weather in January? Sure. Can I find just someone that thinks there was some in March? Yes. It doesn't rise to a threshold that's worth discussing. That was a true in February.

Daniel L. Florness

Nigel, for what it's worth, as Holden was answering that first question, I did take a quick look. Our freight as a percentage of sales that we charged out in the first quarter of 2022 was identical to what it was in the first quarter of 2019. In the last 2 years, it had dropped off about 30 basis points.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Pat Baumann with JPMorgan.

Patrick Michael Baumann

Just a quick one on pricing first. I think there was a wide range on expectations, at least, as I understood it for your pricing coming into this year. Maybe you were thinking it could be down 1 point or 2 or up 1 point or 2, depending on how things played out. I guess I'm just curious, after the first quarter, and your actions in February and what you just said on kind of fasteners with regard to the input cost on that, what your expectations are now for this year on pricing?

And then as a corollary to that, just thinking about your February pricing actions in the non-fastener, non-safety portion of sales. Do you think that had anything to do with kind of the volume slowdown you saw there for the month of March?

Daniel L. Florness

I'll touch on the last part of your question, then I'll let Holden handle the meat of it. But on that last part, if you think about what happened and what we're just running through on those OEM fastener numbers, the drop-off from January to February was linked to production business. Our OEM fasteners dropped in half as far as the -- relative -- from 13.5% to 7% growth. And so that -- there was no pricing action there. And if you look at the remaining product lines, the drop-off actually occurred 30 days after. So I mean, it was really about the production aspect of our business, not so much the other parts of our business.

Holden Lewis

Yes, I would agree with that. The -- plus frankly, those price increases went in sort of late in the quarter. And so I'm not sure that you would have seen a response like -- that you're alluding to in such a tight window. But that said, we're not really expecting that that's going to be adverse those lines from a gross standpoint. The -- yes. So we just -- we didn't see that. I wouldn't expect to see that.

As it relates to the overall pricing, remember, the wide range I've given is because ultimately, we don't have a great deal of visibility as it relates to how much pricing are we going to have to give away to customers because of contracts and things of that nature, right? And so my comment, I think, was if demand softens and there's a lot of pressure to sort of adjust price based on contracts, et cetera, then maybe our pricing is down 1 percentage point. If that doesn't occur because it hasn't to this point, maybe it's up a percentage point. And that was -- that's sort of the wild card from a pricing standpoint that sort of exists out there.

Again, unrelated to price/cost, which regardless, we think will be neutral, but that's why there's a wider range. And I think that that's still the case. And we talked a little bit in an earlier question about, I suspect is yet in 2Q and 3Q we'll be adjusting some pricing.

I will say, however, that I've spoken some people before about how I think pricing comes into that 0% to 2% range probably in the lower half of it if nothing changes. But we have made some changes to our pricing in that other products area. And so what I would tell you is if we never had to adjust fastener pricing, I suspect that our pricing this year will be in the upper half of that 0% to 2% range.

But now the wildcard becomes what do we have to do with fastener pricing? If we give a bunch of that back in 2Q and 3Q, then that upper half of the range comes down. And that's the -- we just don't know the order of magnitude of impacted that yet. I hope that wasn't confusing.

Patrick Michael Baumann

No, no, that's helpful color. Maybe my follow-up would be around gross margin then for this year. I think you were expecting maybe 50 to 100 basis points of contraction when we talked in January. It sounds like maybe pricing could be tracking a bit better. Price/cost may be neutral, I don't know. And the freight commentary was also -- sounded better. So wondering if you're thinking any differently about that framework now.

Holden Lewis

Yes. So again, price/cost -- most of the variables that were impacting gross margin didn't surprise us, right? The degree that mix is impacting -- again, when you think about how the quarter progressed, that didn't surprise. If I think about the price/cost elements of it, that's playing out largely as we expected when we talked about it last quarter.

Really, the only variable that was a surprise was that freight piece. We simply executed fairly well. And again, I do believe that most of the variables that benefited freight, I believe that those variables are going to be in place in 2Q and 3Q. So freight may have increased my expectations around gross margin for the full year, but that's really the one variable that played out differently than I expected it to from last year -- from last quarter's conversations.

Patrick Michael Baumann

Okay. That's helpful. I'll squeeze in one more in, I will.

Holden Lewis

Do we have two?

Patrick Michael Baumann

Yes. No, that's great. Appreciate it.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jacob Levinson with Melius Research.

Jacob Frederick Levinson

I just -- I realize it's still very early days here, but just curious if you've heard anything coming out of the field in terms of the impact of credit stresses on either customers or some of your smaller competitors?

Daniel L. Florness

No, no. We actually reduced -- our bad debt expense was actually a benefit to our margin this quarter. We were just not seeing a significant -- we're not seeing anything in our business regarding that.

Jacob Frederick Levinson

Okay. That makes sense. And then just quickly, a second one. I can see that you're still planning on spending that $200 million-ish capital spending this year despite the fact that the growth has come down a little bit. I mean is that partly just a function of the fact that you haven't been able to get some things done over the last few years with all the volatility around COVID? Or is it really just a function of the fact that, obviously, 10% growth in the quarter is not exactly a recession?

Daniel L. Florness

Well, a, that's a piece. The other thing is we're always adding infrastructure for what we need long term. So if you think about what's going on right now, we're expanding our distribution facility in Denton, Texas and on the other side of the Dallas-Fort Worth area. We are building a distribution facility in the Salt Lake market. And so we're adding capacity because we've all grown the capacity we have.

If you think about our FMI, that's quite strong right now, and that's a capital item that we're adding. And then the last piece would be, if I think of where we've probably struggled the most in recent years to add would be on the vehicle side because stuff just wasn't available. You couldn't get -- we couldn't get our Dodge Ram pickups in the way we wanted to. We couldn't get our semis the way we wanted to. That is loosening up now. And so some of the CapEx is going into the transportation side.

Recently, I was visiting one of our Onsite locations. And I'm pleased to say that I received a picture here, 1.5 weeks ago, a bunch of Fastenal trailers being produced that are coming down the production line. And so those kinds of things, we're able to get better today than we could have 6 and 12 months ago.

Operator

Our next questions come from the line of Tommy Moll with Stephens.

Thomas Allen Moll

I wanted to start off on OpEx. If I'm doing my math right, in the first quarter, employee-related expenses grew at less than half the rate of sales, which is great to see. I suspect you may walk us back from assuming that recurs here in the second quarter or the rest of the year. So to the extent you can frame what you would anticipate for the second quarter, that would be helpful. And just any qualitative commentary for the year would be as well.

Holden Lewis

Yes. I don't know that I'm necessarily going to walk you back. I think it's important to understand the source, right? I mean the reason why we were able to leverage the way we did was because we're just not growing as quickly this year as we grew last year. And so again, I wanted to emphasize that I think we had a healthy payout of incentive pay of the business in this quarter. It wasn't as healthy as last year. And that's not a surprise.

But if I think about how the rest of the year plays out, we still have some pretty large numbers that we're going to lap in the second quarter and the third quarter as well. And so I do expect that we'll have healthy incentive payouts in the second quarter and third quarter. We'll see how the market plays out, but based on sort of how we grew in the most recent quarter, but I do believe that they will be lower than what we experienced last year.

And so I think that we're going to have, for most of the year, that element of lower incentive pay year-over-year that helps us in leveraging the sort of the payroll-related expense.

Daniel L. Florness

A good chunk of our incentive comp -- and we cover this in pretty good detail, I believe, in our proxy. But a good chunk of our incentive comp is tied directly to pretax earnings growth. So if you think what was going on last year, Q1, 2 and 3 had a meaningful expansion of that incentive growth. Actually, Q2 was the highest of the three, but I believe it was about $0.5 million higher in Q2 versus Q1. So just nominally higher and then drops off in Q4.

So depending on what's happening with our earnings growth relative to what was happening in the same quarter of the prior year, that gives us a bit of a buffer here in the first quarter and presumably in the second and third, unless the economy surprises us and it turns more positive, and that would be a great problem to have.

Thomas Allen Moll

I appreciate the insight and wanted to shift for my second question to a higher level strategic question. The framing you provided on the structural improvements in terms of leverage and asset intensity versus the prepandemic base was very helpful. And so there's clearly some progress on both of those initiatives. If you think about 2023, what are some of the key focus areas, the work that's still ahead of you for this year? Are there any that you would draw our attention to that you're really focused on driving through the organization at this point?

Daniel L. Florness

Well, yes, if you think of the growth drivers come to mind first. That's not what your question is. But for me, growth drivers come to mine first of the structural changes we're making as far as customer acquisition both in the standpoint of physically what channel is going through brands versus Onsite, and then what tool are we using within the respective channel, FMI, et cetera, to serve at a really high level in a very efficient level, our customer.

If I think about things that impact our cash flow, we often talk about our covenant with our customer includes a number of things. One, finding great quality of product, great availability of product, reliability of product and great price. One of those elements, the availability, we had to take a tremendous amount of working capital inventory onto our balance sheet over the last 6 to 18 months as things were chaotic, could be late and actually go back several years because we took on a lot of safety products back in 2020, but that piece had been worked through.

So when I think of this year, I envision a very, very strong cash flow year, as we saw in the first quarter because we can take not days, but weeks out of our inventory on hand. We're managing our accounts receivable relationships at a really strong level. It's basically a better CFO today than we did 10 years ago. And things like that help.

But you put those things together, we've talked internally about what we call our Drive to 35%. And what that is, if you look at our internal financial statements, and these would sign through externally, 2 of the 3 would, we look at our accounts receivable business unit by business unit. We look at fully loaded inventory, that's local inventory as well as the allocation of distribution inventory. Then we look at our local vehicles. We look at those three assets, and we say an optimal place for us in $175,000 a month branch, a $200,000 a month branch is above 35%, that number, 35% of the annual sales.

And we haven't been able to drive towards that in the last few years because of COVID, because of inflation, because of supply chain disruption. We're going to continue moving in down towards that path. I don't know if Holden believes we can get to 35%. He's probably a 37% guy, but I believe we can get to 35%. If international allows us to make Holden more right or me more, right? And it's -- if we're growing really well, I'm cool with the either number.

But what puts us in a position to really rationalize the inventory because when you're -- conceptually, when you're pulling inventory through a supply chain network, and you have great visibility of -- 65% of our revenue is in this FMI footprint. We have great visibility to need. And you can manage that -- setting aside the disruptions like you saw last year with, hey, it's taken an extra 30 days to get it through -- across the ocean and through the ports and you need to allow for that. Setting that kind of stuff aside, it's an inherently more efficient model and -- both from a working capital standpoint and from a human capital standpoint.

And you've seen that shine through in both our cash flow this quarter. You're seeing it shine through in our operating expenses, particularly the questions here about components of our people cost.

Holden Lewis

And probably, the only thing I'll add to that is, I mean, if you talk to our sales EVPs. A lot of the things that you're seeing happen, it's us taking advantage of things we've already installed, right? Taking advantage of the changes to sort of the branches, taking advantage of the digital footprint, taking advantage of lift, new role, specialization, all those things. We put those in place, but we haven't necessarily maximized the benefit to our business yet. And I think that our sales EVPs believe that we'll be more efficient 2, 3 years from now than we are today, that there's still plenty of room to run on that.

I would say as well, from an inventory standpoint, again, we're doing a lot of things to improve velocity in our system and things of that nature. But we still have a lot of import inventory that we can work off. When we think about how far in the future we had to think about our purchasing behavior during the pandemic when constraints were there, we probably doubled our window for ordering. Right now, if we went from 4 months to 8 months or probably back down to 7 months, there's still more room to go to get closer to where we were prepandemic. I don't know that we'll get all the way there. Our fulfillment rates are higher. But there's still a lot more room to go.

And so again, we've become -- our comments about where we are as a business was intended to say we've arrived. It was to make the point that we've progressed down a road nicely, but that road still has room to run.

Daniel L. Florness

I think we have time for one more question. If there's one left. I see it's 4 minutes to the hour, and we like to finished properly. Just one more question, we'll take it, otherwise we'll wrap up.

Operator

Sure. Sure. The next questions come from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS.

Christopher M. Snyder

I guess maybe for the one question. Specifically, we're looking for more color on the back half March softness. It sounds like the month ended softer than it started. Any end markets or product lines that saw a negative rate of change throughout the month? Because the ones you guys kind of called out was retail customers, international, construction kind of stuff that's been weak for the last 3 quarters. So did those just get weaker? Or did you see anything else kind of weaken as the month went on?

Holden Lewis

We don't have great visibility into specific end markets for the most part. What I would tell you is...

Daniel L. Florness

Within a month.

Holden Lewis

Yes, within a month. And certainly, within manufacturing, it can be a little bit tricky within that particular bucket. But the -- what I'll tell you is outside of our Taxane region, which was still fairly positive on overall demand...

Daniel L. Florness

That's Texas and Louisiana (inaudible).

Holden Lewis

Yes, very oil and gas oriented, still a really good outlook there. And so I think that market is doing well. Frankly, the vast majority of our other regions all had some variation of things softened in March. And just tell you it was pretty broad through the manufacturing space, not specific to any one market or what have you.

Daniel L. Florness

I'll add a little piece. And this isn't (inaudible), this is an observation. So I had a lot of discussions with global operations -- entities, customers of ours or potential customers of ours over the last 2 days. And there was tremendous intersecting event. It's quite a few people that said, part of the reason we're here is we want to learn what you're doing from a technology standpoint to help our business.

And one of the advantages when there's a breather, when there's less noise and less things you're worrying about, all of a sudden, the things you haven't done for the last 12 or 24 or 36 months because the world kept repeating itself of trying to end. The -- I think that's positive for our ability to take market share.

And even if the business itself, the customer -- if you look at our -- and we talk about our top 100 customers, if you dial that in a little bit, and you start looking at our top 10, that's what really hurt us is our top 10 customers were -- and contracting from where they were 6 months ago. And that's economic. But our top -- if you look at customers 10 through 50, they were growing. If you look at customers 50 through 100, they were growing nicely because we're picking up market share. And that makes me more enthused. Because long term, our success is from taking market share every day. The economy is going to do in the short term what the economy is going to do.

We have a healthy business. We generate more cash flow in a year like this. We'd rather be deploying the cash flow into the business. But in the year like this, maybe we'll return a little bit more to shareholders. But it's a case of focusing on the long-term opportunity of the business, and I'm as excited as ever.

With that, it's on the hour. Thanks for your interest in Fastenal today. Everybody, have a great April. Thanks, everyone.

https://www.pr.com/press-release/884341,OutcomesX Marketplace Launches with Deal to Move Funding Directly to Ukrainian NGOs Struggling to Access International Aid; $2 Million Committed by UBS Optimus Foundation,"New York, NY, April 13, 2023 --( PR.com )-- OutcomesX , a first-of-its-kind social outcomes marketplace, launched today with a deal to transfer $2 million in relief donations from UBS Optimus Foundation clients and employees directly to local NGOs in Ukraine that are providing education and mental health services to children in-country.This comes amid recent studies revealing that red tape is preventing Ukrainian nonprofits from accessing bilateral and multilateral relief funds to help those in need inside the country’s borders. And it marks another step in UBS Optimus Foundation creating positive outcomes for resident and internally displaced Ukrainians affected by war.The way the platform works: OutcomesX recruited 63 Ukrainian nonprofit organizations to register their proof of outcomes and then set a price per outcome that captured the full cost an NGO incurred getting results. UBS Optimus Foundation selected a portfolio among those recruited and is purchasing $2 million units of outcomes (results per student) from OutcomesX, which in turn is transmitting funds directly to selected local organizations, including EdCamp and Divchata with a verification process as results unfold.The UBS Optimus Foundation is an early partner for OutcomesX, which allows nonprofits to sell outcomes across multiple social impact fields and geographies. UBS launched an emergency relief fund for Ukraine to raise funds from its clients and employees to support children in country as well as those who have been forced to flee, and it used the social outcomes marketplace as an efficient way to allocate relief funds to organizations best placed to help.Said Maya Ziswiler, CEO of UBS Optimus Foundation: “Building on our experience valuing education outcomes through a social impact bond in India, we are excited to be working with OutcomesX to fund social outcomes. We believe that outcomes marketplaces have the potential to break down some of the barriers to funding grassroots NGOs and help scale their impact.”OutcomesX recruited 63 nonprofits working on two outcomes that UBS Optimus Foundation sought for Ukrainian children: improved learning and improved mental health. Recruited NGOs uploaded their data and cost information into a tool called the Impact Genome Registry . The registry rates the quality of a nonprofit’s data based on rigor of collection method (whether anecdotal, point in time, pre-post action assessments, or a full blown randomized controlled trial); relevance to the outcome (such as whether the data related to the specified outcomes); and validity (how closely the approach corresponds to methods proving their merit elsewhere).Said Olga Tsipan, head of the community-based Center for Child Development Erudit in Berezne, Ukraine: “The social outcomes marketplace enables us to upload proof of outcomes in mental health that we are achieving for children, amid war, and thus become eligible to meet and sell those outcomes to global donors. We as a community-based nonprofit never would have been able to reach donors abroad who care about Ukrainian children's well-being without coming to a marketplace. This is a game changer for us as it changes the way we fundraise and helps organizations on the ground make a big difference.”To move relief dollars fast, the marketplace is up and running with manual trades, and automation is around the corner to pave the way to cutting red tape throughout the international aid system and democratizing relief funding. Any funder of any size can buy verified outcomes, and any nonprofit with proof of outcomes can sell their service delivery and access liquidity.Said Jason Saul, cofounder and CEO of OutcomesX: “The process of applying for funding is so complicated and time-consuming that local Ukrainian NGOs can’t access the money they desperately need, more than a dozen Ukrainian aid workers told The New Humanitarian. A social outcomes marketplace can change that, bringing efficiency to funders and equity to the process of accessing capital for social impact producers.”Added Phyllis Costanza, cofounder and President: “Today, smaller, minority-led and locallanguage nonprofits are often at a fundraising disadvantage. Many don’t have the social capital or costly grant writers and evaluation consultants that larger and better-connected organizations might. But a social-outcomes marketplace levels that playing field by giving organizations a central resource to find capital and compete for it based solely on their ability to deliver results.”For more information on the OutcomesX marketplace and how to participate in it, contact Phyllis Costanza at phyllis@outcomesx.com.For reporter inquiries, contact MilwayPLUS advisors at katiesmith.milway@gmail.com.OutcomesX is a social outcomes exchange whose mission is to transform social impact into a tradable good that impact investors, corporations and philanthropy can purchase from vetted nonprofits and social enterprises. OutcomesX creates the infrastructure to standardize, price, trade, and report on social impact credits, providing quantifiable means to measure the “S” in ESG. Outcome buyers benefit from price discovery and verified data to inform social spend, and impact producers get access to liquidity and a reduced reporting burden. Above all, OutcomesX brings efficiency and equity to the business of social impact, allowing any organization, large, small or community-led, access to capital based on their results.",[],

In recent weeks, Iqbal Khan, global head of wealth management at UBS, met with counterparts at Credit Suisse, including the lender's local wealth head Puneet Matta in Singapore, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter.

The move would give the Swiss lender a stronger foothold among the growing ranks of Indian billionaires while underscoring a return for Khan, who steered the private wealth business during his time at Credit Suisse before joining UBS in 2019.

Credit Suisse has around 40 wealth management employees in India and around 7,000 people. According to the bank's website, India is the second-largest footprint for Credit Suisse outside of Switzerland.

The considerations aren't final, the people said. UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment on the report to Bloomberg.

By 2014, UBS had opted to exit India's private-wealth market.

In recent months, UBS has already hired several Credit Suisse private bankers in Singapore to target India's wealthy client portfolio, including Gautam Anand, a managing director.

The $3.2 billion central-bank-brokered deal will shut off most of Credit Suisse's investment banking.

UBS Group also announced elimination of about 20 to 30% of jobs worldwide amid the takeover.

The Islanders' first-round opponent has been set.

Following the Hurricanes' 6-4 win over the Florida Panthers on Thursday night, New York has captured the first wild card spot and will travel to Carolina in the first round of the 2023 Stanley Cup Playoffs.



The Islanders lost the season series, 3-1, with their only victory coming in the first game back in October. In that matchup, the Islanders won 6-2 with Brock Nelson grabbing two third-period goals to put the game away.

New York would lose the next three games by a score of 3-0, 5-2 and 2-1. That last matchup happened on April 2. Jean-Gabriel Pageau gave the Islanders an early lead, but the Hurricanes would tie it in the second and take the lead early in the third period for the eventual win.

The Islanders and Hurricanes have met just once in the playoffs. In their 2019 series, Carolina would sweep the Isles and outscored them, 13-5.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swiss-lower-house-votes-second-125103244.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,Swiss Lower House Censures UBS Guarantees in Symbolic Vote,"(Bloomberg) -- Switzerland’s lower house made a symbolic vote against providing state guarantees for UBS Group AG’s takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG, reflecting a high degree of public discontent with the deal.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The lower house rejected a compromise offered by the upper house, leading to a failure of the bill and ending parliamentary proceedings. Irrespective of the vote, parliament can’t stop the takeover negotiated last month as a designated committee of lawmakers had already signed off on it.

The rejection nonetheless casts a shadow over the already-fraught process of integrating two global banks, particularly as significant job cuts loom in Switzerland in a year when national elections are due. In the aftermath of the historic $3.3 billion deal, lawmakers have called for various changes including greater powers for the financial regulator Finma, though little consensus has emerged.

“The majority in parliament wanted to make a statement,” said Michael Hermann, a political scientist and head of Zurich-based research institute Sotomo. “This shows that the topic politically causes high waves in Switzerland.”

Read More: UBS Says Credit Suisse Integration Bigger Than 2008 Deals

A coalition of the populist right and the left generated enough votes to ensure the bill didn’t pass. It would have given the stamp of approval for putting state funds of as much $120 billion at stake. The Swiss People’s Party SVP, which forms the largest bloc, lobbied together with the Greens and some Social Democrats against it.

“The SVP has been insisting since 2008 that we have no bank that cannot go bankrupt,” said Pirmin Schwander, a member of the lower house for the party. The state guarantees only fuel a “narcissistic company culture” among bankers, he said.

Story continues

UBS Effect

The vote, with 103 ballots against, 71 in favor and eight abstentions, is a defeat for Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter and the delegation of senior lawmakers which agreed to the backstop on behalf of parliament before the takeover was announced in March.

The debate is unlikely to have any immediate effect on UBS, but may indicate appetite for stricter rules on the horizon. UBS has already faced questions over the combined company’s heft — double the size of the Swiss economy — and its potential local dominance. UBS’s vice chairman said last week that the bank will consider all options for Credit Suisse’s Swiss unit.

The Swiss government earlier this month said that UBS must ensure its pay structures encourage employees to avoid using the state guarantee.

Politicians and business leaders had voiced worries that the combined lender will have excessive market power, leading to a loss of competition. Despite the risks involved in integrating Credit Suisse, UBS stands to become a banking “powerhouse” post merger, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in a note Tuesday.

The deal was also met with little public enthusiasm.

During the afternoon it looked like the parliament in Bern could reach an agreement, with some Social Democrats changing their views. A stricter stance on banks — a compromise had lined out higher equity requirements and restricted bonuses — is “a major development,” Social Democrat lawmaker Roger Nordmann had said.

“The debate is ticked off now. There will be no further cleanup of the differences between parliament and government,” Sotomo’s Hermann said. “Now everyone can feel vindicated again that democracy has been eroded. This discontent with the system will further strengthen populists and the far right.”

Swiss Politics

Switzerland’s executive isn’t made up of a coalition or an outright majority, but of seven ministers from the country’s four largest parties. They usually make decisions by consensus and try to find pragmatic compromises — often outside of party lines.

Ministers don’t publicly oppose government decisions, irrespective of their parties’ stance on a matter or how they personally voted behind closed doors.

This setup means that parliament offers parties the most prominent platform to sway voters, which explains aggressive comments in that forum even if they at times lack bite.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase UBS Group's shares before the 12th of April to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 14th of April.

The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.55 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.55 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, UBS Group stock has a trailing yield of around 2.7% on the current share price of CHF18.73. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing.

View our latest analysis for UBS Group

Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. UBS Group is paying out just 24% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events.

Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.

Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.

Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?

Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see UBS Group's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 57% per annum for the past five years.

Story continues

Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, UBS Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 19% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.

Final Takeaway

Should investors buy UBS Group for the upcoming dividend? Typically, companies that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings are keeping the profits for reinvestment in the business. This is one of the most attractive investment combinations under this analysis, as it can create substantial value for investors over the long run. UBS Group ticks a lot of boxes for us from a dividend perspective, and we think these characteristics should mark the company as deserving of further attention.

While it's tempting to invest in UBS Group for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for UBS Group you should know about.

Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.

The upper house gave its green light earlier in the day.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Lawmakers from both sides of the political spectrum again lined up to blame the government, regulators and the bank’s management for failures around the takeover last month. Two hours into the debate in the lower house, it wasn’t clear if a vote on the guarantees would be held Tuesday night.

Damien Cottier, an MP with the Liberal-Radicals, called the day the deal was struck a “day of shame” for Switzerland before going on to call it the “least-bad and least risky” option.

Cottier’s tone reflects that of many frustrated lawmakers who are critical — and in an election year want to be seen as being so — of the banks and the government while at the same time are wary of trying to block the deal. Though parliament doesn’t have the power to derail the takeover, the extraordinary session has forced the government to once again defend the unpopular emergency takeover by UBS Group AG announced on March 19.

In that vein, Swiss President Alain Berset opened the lower-house debate after 7pm local time by saying Credit Suisse’s “negative spiral” spurred his government into action. Temporary nationalisation, a forced bankruptcy and orderly wind-down of the bank were all considered but rejected in favor of the UBS takeover, he said.

The government, Swiss National Bank and Swiss banking regulator Finma “acted in a decisive manner to restore confidence,” Berset said.

Earlier in the day, more than a dozen lawmakers in the upper house voiced their grievances. Their concerns varied from being circumvented in the emergency legislation, to regulatory lapses that allowed Credit Suisse’s failings to go un-addressed, to demanding accountability for the bank’s management.

“The legal possibilities against the bankers responsible and the possibilities to claw back bonuses need to be exhausted to the fullest extent,” said the president of the Free Democrats Thierry Burkart.

Some legislators called for greater powers for the financial regulator, Finma, amid a broader review of too-big-to-fail rules for the sector, while others asked for a parliamentary inquiry commission. Quick legislative changes are unlikely though, as became apparent during the debate.

The deal — described by Berset earlier as the best option to re-establish confidence in markets — created a banking giant whose assets are more than twice the size of the Swiss economy.

Job Cuts

Politicians and business leaders have voiced worries that the combined lender will have excessive market power, leading to a loss of competition. Despite the risks involved in integrating Credit Suisse, UBS stands to become a banking “powerhouse” post merger, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in a note Tuesday.

UBS, already one of the world’s largest wealth managers, is now taking over a key rival for a fraction of the value of its assets and receiving as much as 9 billion Swiss francs in government loss guarantees.

Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter made clear that if these guarantees turned out to be not enough, it would be up to parliament to decide on an extension. The government and UBS agreed on the lender taking on the first 5 billion francs in potential losses, before the administration steps in for the next 9 billion.

Before the takeover, Credit Suisse had already planned to cut as many as 9,000 jobs worldwide over the coming years. The overlaps between the two banks’ businesses will likely lead to that number rising, though executives including UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher have said that it’s too early to say how big the cuts will be.

‘Finma Failed’

Finma didn’t move in time, said Heidi Z’graggen, upper-house member of the Center Alliance.

“Finma’s job is to protect shareholder rights and ensure functioning of the financial center,” she said. “At this, Finma failed.”

A parliamentary inquiry commission is necessary to answer whether the financial regulator, the Swiss National Bank and the finance ministry reacted properly, she said. Such a body would have subpoena powers to summon witnesses.

Given the merger has been met with little public enthusiasm, parliament is also trying to curtail government powers in the future: They are attempting to block the use of emergency measures to push through deals like this.

Richard Drew/Associated Press

Stock prices for the rest of 2023, UBS's investment chief predicts.

Markets could ""keep jumping from one narrative to another"" as economic data rolls in, Mark Haefele said.

Investors are still struggling to make sense of the US labor market, he added.

It's going to remain tricky for investors to pick stocks for the rest of this year because markets are still hooked on unpredictable economic data, according to UBS.

The Swiss bank's CIO Mark Haefele expects the choppiness stocks seen in the early months of 2023 to continue, thanks to traders' fixation on the rate of inflation and unemployment.

""So far, 2023 has been a much better year for asset class returns, with the S&P 500 up 7.5% year-to-date, but has been characterized by ever-changing market narratives,"" Haefele wrote in a note Wednesday.

The investment chief was referring to the benchmark US stock index's rebound this year from a plunge of 18% in 2022.

""The potential remains for this data-dependent market to keep jumping from one narrative to another for the rest of the year,"" he added. ""This should make it difficult for investors to navigate the coming months.""

The note comes ahead of the release later Wednesday of the monthly Consumer Price Index report, which will show how much US inflation rose in March. His bank believes the CPI will come in at 5.1% — down from 6% in February, but still far off the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

Markets will stay unpredictable even if inflation cools for a ninth month in a row, according to Haefele, because investors are still struggling to make sense of the US labor market.

Friday's nonfarm payrolls report showed the US economy added 236,000 jobs in March, its lowest print since December 2020. Investors are divided on whether that's good or bad news.

""While the optimistic interpretation of this data is that the tightness in the labor market is easing as the balance of supply and demand of labor improves, the pessimists view it as the first cracks that could be followed by much greater deterioration in the coming months,"" Haefele said.

Story continues

Worries about an economic slowdown could soon replace inflation tracking as a key focus, UBS's investment chief added.

Economists have warned that the Fed's year of aggressive interest-rate hikes will likely soon start weighing on growth – and that slowdown could drag on stocks by chipping away at listed companies' earnings.

""As inflation eases, growth may take over as the more dominant concern, perceived or otherwise,"" Haefele said.

""The optics of a decline in headline CPI to 3% may reinforce the view that growth, rather than inflation, will be driving Fed decisions and the market's performance,"" he added.

https://news.yahoo.com/swiss-parliament-grapples-compromise-ubs-072753540.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,Swiss Parliament Nears Deal on UBS Guarantees as MPs Change Vote,"(Bloomberg) -- Swiss parliament is approaching a deal to push through government guarantees for UBS Group AG’s takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG after a upper houses compromise was met with approval in the lower chamber.

Most Read from Bloomberg

“The majority of our party will vote for this proposal if the government will pursue higher capital ratios and restricted bonuses,” Social Democrat lawmaker Roger Nordmann said in the lower house in Bern on Wednesday. The stricter stance on banks is “a major development,” he said.

The 200-member lower house late on Tuesday voted against the 109 billion francs ($120 billion) in guarantees. While that was a symbolic vote that can’t stop the deal, it clashed with the upper house’s approval earlier in the day.

As a stalemate would force the bill to fail, the upper house earlier today adopted amendments in line with what their lower-house colleagues had demanded. Those provisions seek to adjust the law to limit the risks systemically relevant banks pose to taxpayers.

Comments by Nordmann and other lower-house lawmakers now suggest that a majority will be achieved in both chambers, allowing Switzerland to avoid an embarrassing situation.

Irrespective of the vote, parliament can’t stop the takeover negotiated last month as the government already got approval from a small group of senior lawmakers, which is entitled to act on behalf of parliament in case of urgency.

The key demand the upper house now passed calls on the government to revise banking laws demanding higher capital requirements and restrictions on bonuses. But lawmakers’ agreed wording only stipulates that the executive should “examine” this, not that it is “instructed” to do so.

Story continues

“We are agreed that after the events of March 19 we cannot just move on,” said Pirmin Bischof, a Center Alliance member in the upper house, referring to the day the deal was agreed. “The too-big-to-fail regulation just simply didn’t have any effect. And so we need to ask the government to come up with a changed law that will solve this problem.”

Symbolic Vote

The lower house’s rejection — just before midnight on Tuesday — highlights the anger among lawmakers on both sides of the political spectrum ahead of national elections later this year. An overall rejection would send a signal of Switzerland’s legislative not backing the deal, which some MPs suggested should be done.

“We should only approve a deal when it’s good enough for the Confederation — right now this deal is only good enough for UBS,” said Thomas Minder, adding that a ‘no’ wouldn’t be the “end of the world.”

Lawmakers also acknowledged their lack of power of actually influencing the deal.

“If we could really turn down the loans here, I believe nobody would hesitate,” said Eva Herzog of the Social Democrats.

The standoff is largely symbolic. The government had said that “if parliament refuses subsequent approval, it will be tantamount to a political reprimand” for the group of senior lawmakers that green-lit it, but would have “no legal effect.”

The Credit Suisse crisis three weeks ago has shaken Switzerland, evoking memories of the Great Financial Crisis. The government argued on Tuesday that the creation of a Swiss banking juggernaut was the best solution among a limited number of options.

In addition to state guarantees, the Swiss National Bank offered liquidity assistance. SNB sight deposit numbers published this week suggest that after accessing such money, Credit Suisse may have returned more than half of the funds.

Switzerland’s executive isn’t made up of a coalition or an outright majority, but of seven ministers from the country’s four largest parties. They usually make decisions by consensus and try to find pragmatic compromises — often outside of party lines.

Ministers don’t publicly oppose government decisions, irrespective of their parties’ stance on a matter or how they personally voted behind closed doors.

This setup means that parliament offers parties the most prominent platform to sway voters, which explains aggressive comments in that forum even if they at times lack bite.

https://news.yahoo.com/stocks-rally-dollar-dips-further-025147700.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,"Stocks rally, dollar dips further on easing rate expectations","Equity markets rallied and the dollar dipped further Friday after fresh data showing continued slowing of inflation fanned hopes the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its long-running campaign of interest rate hikes.

The surprise on-month drop in producer prices in March -- and the biggest since April 2020 -- came a day after the consumer price index dropped more than expected, suggesting the central bank's tightening campaign was finally paying off.

A higher-than-forecast reading on jobless claims added to the positive mood, which helped send Wall Street's three main indexes rallying, including a two percent advance for the Nasdaq.

Investors are now betting the Fed will hike rates 25 basis points at its May gathering but possibly hold after that, with some still clinging to hopes it will even cut by the end of the year.

In a sign of cooling inflation elsewhere, Singapore's central bank stood pat on rates, having hiked five times in a row. The move follows similar decisions in Australia, India, Canada and South Korea.

This week's data has reassured investors that inflation is coming down and that the economy could be heading for a soft landing, even though minutes from the Fed's March policy meeting revealed some officials see a mild recession by the year's end.

""Coming fast on the heels of yesterday's better-than-expected (consumer prices) reading, today's (producer price index) print, plus the in-line jobless claims report, reinforces the view that the labour market continues to rebalance and that the post-pandemic inflation scare is ending,"" said SPI Asset Management's Stephen Innes.

""And as we move into the seventh-inning stretch, where arguably much could happen between now and the final pitch, the combination of progress on inflation and the softer labour market has been encouraging.

""It reinforces the view that the Fed may be in the 9th inning of the hiking cycle, which markets seem to be endorsing today as yields on 10-year Treasuries declined.""

Paris dashed out of the blocks at the open and hit a record high of 7,500 points, while London and Frankfurt also rose.

Asian equities rose Friday, with Tokyo leading the way followed by Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei, Manila and Jakarta.

""Inflation is not surprising to the upside,"" said Que Nguyen of Research Affiliates.

""At the same time, the job market seems stable. And so what we're getting today is sort of an optimistic outlook that we're going to have almost like a Goldilocks situation where inflation's going to slow, but the economy is not crashing.""

Focus now turns to the release of US retail sales Friday while corporate earnings season kicks off in earnest, with results from banking titans including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup.

Traders are keenly awaiting their outlook statements in light of the upheaval in the banking sector last month that saw three US lenders go under and Credit Suisse bought by rival UBS.

With Thursday's data lowering expectations for where rates will top out, the dollar has come under pressure, hitting a one-year low against the euro. And it continued to struggle Friday, falling further versus the single currency, while the pound was at its best level since June.

""Given the strength of dollar selling this week, it would take a surprisingly strong rise in consumer sentiment, retail sales and inflation expectations to shake the dollar bears off before the weekend,"" said Matt Simpson at City Index.

Oil prices rose in Asian business, extending a rally sparked by major producers' decision this month to slash output by more than a million barrels a day.

The OPEC+ group said Thursday the move had put world markets on course to be in deficit, which will widen as the year goes on, with China's reopening adding extra pressure.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swiss-finance-minister-sees-no-104939087.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,Swiss finance minister sees no 'stumbling blocks' to UBS takeover of Credit Suisse,"ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS's multi-billion state-sponsored takeover of Credit Suisse should proceed smoothly without political obstructions, Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said in an interview published on Saturday.

The Swiss parliament is due to hold an extraordinary session next week to discuss the emergency merger engineered by the Swiss authorities after Credit Suisse came close to collapse.

Nearly 260 billion Swiss francs ($287 billion) of liquidity support and state guarantees have been offered to back the takeover and avoid a financial meltdown the bank's uncontrolled failure could have triggered.

""There is a merger agreement between UBS and CS, for its part the cabinet has made a commitment to the national bank to provide CS with liquidity in order to ensure stability,"" Keller-Sutter told newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft.

""The guarantee agreement with UBS is still being negotiated. In many committee meetings, I got the impression that politicians definitely don't want to jeopardize the takeover,"" she added.

""I don't see any stumbling blocks at the moment.""

Completing the merger was the highest priority, the minister said, who defended the government's intervention last month, which critics have said came too late and promised too much taxpayer support for a bank that paid out billions in bonuses to executives.

""The primary goal of the Federal Council was to ensure the stability of the Swiss economy and the Swiss financial center and to prevent an international financial crisis,"" she said.

""Under the circumstances, it was and is the best possible choice, which also places the least burden on the state and the taxpayer,"" Keller-Sutter said.

The new combined bank will have $1.6 trillion in assets - double the size of the entire Swiss economy - and more than 120,000 staff and Keller-Sutter said the structure of UBS would have to be considered in the future.

Story continues

""UBS will have to hold more equity after the takeover. This will rather force them to shrink,"" Keller-Sutter said.

Switzerland's Competition Commission can also make recommendations, the minister added.

The risks to the taxpayer were also acceptable - even though the government could assume up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS by the takeover.

Keller-Sutter criticized the culture at Credit Suisse, which she said had set the wrong incentives and had not learned from previous scandals and prosecutions.

The minister also defended the writedown of AT1 bonds to zero, a controversial part of the rescue.

""These are high-risk bonds with high yields, sometimes over 9%,"" Keller-Sutter said. ""The prospectus for these bonds makes it clear that if a company claims indirect government aid, they can be written off.""

The special parliamentary session next week was important, she added, and a welcome opportunity to get to the truth of the Credit Suisse debacle.

""At the moment, parliament can 'only' advise on the commitment credit, but it also has the opportunity to comment on the case and play an active role in the process.""

Analyst sees GE as a defensive play amid increasing concerns about economic growth

Shares of General Electric Co. gained ground Thursday after bullish UBS analyst Chris Snyder raised his price target by 15%, saying the aviation, power and renewable-energy company is a defensive play in the face of a worrisome economic outlook.

Synder said while the market's valuation of GE's (GE) stock may be ""pushing near the upper limit,"" his chief concern is geopolitical, not macroeconomic.

""[GE's] exposure is defensive and well positioned for the macro at hand with each business line seeing low-risk [positive] rate of change, into both 2023 [and] 2024,"" Snyder wrote in a note to clients.

He reiterated the buy rating he's had on GE's stock for at least three years while lifting his price target to $109 from $95. The stock hasn't closed at or above $109 since January 2018.

The stock rose 0.1% in afternoon trading, with Snyder's new price target implying about 16% upside from current levels. It has slipped nearly 3% since closing at a five-year high of $96.92 on April 3.

Synder said his new price target includes a $94-per-share valuation for GE's aviation business and a $16-per-share valuation for GE Vernova, which includes the company's power and renewable-energy businesses.

GE Vernova is expected to separate from GE in early 2024, which would leave GE operating as GE Aerospace. GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (GEHC)separated from GE in January 2023.

GE is scheduled to report first-quarter results on April 25 before the opening bell. Since the end of January, after the separation of GE HealthCare, the average analyst estimate compiled by FactSet for earnings per share has increased to 14 cents from 13 cents, while the FactSet revenue consensus has slipped to $13.25 billion from $13.35 billion.

Of the 21 analysts surveyed by FactSet who cover GE, 14 are bullish and seven are neutral, and the average stock-price target is $101.17. Snyder's new price target makes him the fourth most bullish on the stock.

GE shares have run up 17% since the end of January, while the S&P 500 has advanced 1.7%.

https://nypost.com/2023/04/13/islanders-give-fans-just-what-they-asked-for/,Islanders give fans just what they asked for,"The first chants tumbled from the upper levels of UBS Arena a good 15 minutes before the puck dropped. There are plenty of places inside the Islanders’ palatial home where the patrons can find fine beverages and splendid food. But, then, if they wanted to be “patrons” they would go to a golf tournament and politely clap their hands.

They were here Wednesday night for a hockey game, the first truly essential game in the history of UBS Arena, a win-and-you’re-in special, and so they traded in their patrons’ ID badges and morphed into full-throated, red-blooded, old-school “fans.” They would be damned if the NHL playoffs were going to begin without the lads in blue.

“LET’S GO ISLANDERS!”

“LET’S GO ISLANDERS!!”

“LET’S GO ISLANDERS!!!”

“The fans knew what was at stake,” Brock Nelson said, maybe five minutes after the final horn had made it official, a 4-2 Islanders taming of the Canadiens that secured them the last of the 16 spots in the Stanley Cup tournament. “We needed that energy.”

Nelson, of course, was also a useful part of the script. It was Nelson who snuck the first puck past Montreal goalie Sam Montembeault 10 minutes and 26 seconds into the game, which served as a necessary defibrillator for the 17,113 scattered about the rink who were sitting on pins and needles when they weren’t screaming themselves hoarse.

Then, 10:20 into the second period, Nelson added a second goal, the one that proved to be the winner, pushing the lead to 3-1 and bringing a spasm of thunder that formally and officially christened their new home. They had to grind through the final 30 minutes against Montreal, because if there is one law in hockey it is this: If a team suits up, they’re going to get after it, and come after you, regardless of what their record is.

The Penguins had learned that lesson the hard way 24 hours earlier, when they allowed the Blackhawks to walk into their arena having lost three in a row and nine out of 10 and walk out with a win. That had been the lifeline the Islanders — who’d suffered their own egregious no-show in Washington on Monday — desperately needed.

They knew they had to deliver a top-shelf effort against Montreal. And the fans, sensing blood, tasting the playoffs, weren’t going to allow anything else.

“WE WANT THE PLAYOFFS!”

“WE WANT THE PLAYOFFS!!”

“WE WANT THE PLAYOFFS!!!”

“We’re looking forward to hearing them in the playoffs,” said Anders Lee, the captain, whose power-play goal with four minutes left in the game finally put it away. “They really brought it, they were really huge. It’s tough to play in a building like that. They brought the noise.”

Said coach Lane Lambert: “We feed off that.”

So, for the first time, New Fort Neverlose rose from its new foundation 15 miles west of the old one. The Isles had suffered through an 82-game study in aggravation last year, playing their first 13 games on the road as UBS was being completed, and they could never overcome a 5-10-5 start. This time around, they seemed like a shoo-in for the playoffs a week ago. And then they weren’t.

“You go from the dumps [in Washington] to watching the Blackhawks win that game and give us some life,” Zach Parise said. “But we still had to come here and win a game.”

They won the game. They join the Rangers and the Devils in the playoffs, and if you’d care to add the Knicks and the Nets, it’s the first time since 1994 when all five of New York’s winter teams have qualified for the same playoff season. After an extended season of multi-sport ineptitude, there is a little something for everyone around town.

There was plenty for Islanders fans Wednesday night. They arrived early. They enjoyed the hell out of themselves for 2 ½ hours. They crowded the corridors on the way out, loitering, lingering, not wanting to go home yet. As a fan, you eat a lot of mud in a lot of years. You get a night like Wednesday, you want to savor it. You want to relish it. They stuck around for a few more choruses.

“LET’S GO ISLANDERS!”

“LET’S GO ISLANDERS!!”

“LET’s GO ISLANDERS!!!”

“I’m looking forward to them carrying it over to the playoffs,” Parise said.

They’ll be here. They’ll be ready. The New Fort Neverlose will be fortified for the Bruins or the Hurricanes, knowing the odds will be long and the opponent fierce. Never bothered them before at the Old Barn. No reason it should start now.","['Social Links For Mike Vaccaro', 'Contact The Author']",2023-04-13 00:00:00

UBS Group AG UBS is reportedly looking to retain Credit Suisse Group AG's CS private banking unit in India, making way for a potential return to the market.

is reportedly looking to retain private banking unit in India, making way for a potential return to the market. In recent weeks, Iqbal Khan, global head of wealth management at UBS, met with counterparts at Credit Suisse, including the lender's local wealth head Puneet Matta in Singapore, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter.

Credit Suisse Rescue Package Retrospectively Rejected By Lower House Of Swiss Parliament — But There's A Catch. The move would give the Swiss lender a stronger foothold among the growing ranks of Indian billionaires while underscoring a return for Khan, who steered the private wealth business during his time at Credit Suisse before joining UBS in 2019.

Credit Suisse has around 40 wealth management employees in India and around 7,000 people. According to the bank's website, India is the second-largest footprint for Credit Suisse outside of Switzerland.

The considerations aren't final, the people said. UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment on the report to Bloomberg.

By 2014, UBS had opted to exit India's private-wealth market.

In recent months, UBS has already hired several Credit Suisse private bankers in Singapore to target India's wealthy client portfolio, including Gautam Anand, a managing director.

The $3.2 billion central-bank-brokered deal will shut off most of Credit Suisse's investment banking.

UBS Group also announced elimination of about 20 to 30% of jobs worldwide amid the takeover.

Price Action: UBS shares are down 1.42% at $21.20 on the last check Wednesday.

That’s according to a recent report from UBS, which found that store closures in 2023 are already up significantly compared to the prior year. In the last few months, various retailers have announced plans to consolidate their store bases and close stores. Foot Locker last month announced a decision to close more than 400 stores locations through 2026 focus on higher-performing doors. Walmart also recently announced a plan to close seven underperforming stores, including its last two pickup and delivery concept locations.

By the end of 2027, UBS estimates that about 50,000 stores will close across the current U.S. store count of about 940,000 stores, meaning there would be less than 5 percent fewer stores by the end of 2027.

Retailers have announced about 2,600 store closures and 5,100 store openings for the year, according to Coresight Research cited in BDO’s bi-annual bankruptcy report. Store openings this year have been mainly led by dollar store and discount chains, which have benefitted from cost-cutting consumers.

As for the reasons for the predicted closures, UBS outlined a few key factors. For starters, the cost to run a store is going up, especially as wages increase and rents stay high. At the same time, a general slowdown in consumer spending, less available credit and e-commerce growth are also to blame.

UBS predicts e-commerce penetration to grow from its current 20 percent to 26 percent by 2027, with 25 percent of online sales being fulfilled from stores. This model also assumes that retail sales grow 4 percent annually.

Story continues

The National Retail Federation forecast that retail sales will grow between 4 percent and 6 percent in 2023, with sales reaching between $5.13 trillion and $5.23 trillion this year. While NRF has said a recession is unlikely in 2023, a recession could result in even more store closures, UBS said.

The stores at risk of closures are those of smaller chains, department stores and specialty retailers with mainly discretionary items.

“In our view, these smaller chains and mom and pops are most at risk of closures given these firms typically have less access to capital needed to invest in developing a robust omnichannel offering,” UBS analysts wrote in the report.

Meanwhile, off-price retailers and dollar stores are set to continue to grow their presence as they resonate with cost-conscious consumers.

Like store closures, retail bankruptcies are set to come back into play in a big way in 2023 after a relatively slow year in 2022. Between the start of 2023 through the end of February, six major retailers filed for bankruptcy, according to BDO’s bi-annual bankruptcy report. That’s more than the total number of retail bankruptcies in 2022.

In some cases, these bankruptcies could correlate with store closures for chains as well.

""From my trip to the Middle East in February, a number of investors that I met have shown interest in setting up their family offices here in Asia, particularly in Hong Kong, because they are drawn to the opportunities in the Greater Bay Area,"" said Amy Lo, co-head of wealth management for Asia-Pacific at UBS and Hong Kong CEO.

The government organised the summit, which attracted more than 100 overseas tycoons and family office operators, to show the city was back to normal after three years of disruption caused by the pandemic. A range of initiatives were unveiled to promote the city as a family office hub.

Amy Lo, co-head of wealth management for Asia-Pacific at UBS and Hong Kong CEO, says the Hong Kong government's initiatives will positively shape the city's development as an international centre for family offices. Photo: K.Y. Cheng

The policies include a revamped investment-migration scheme, tax incentives and the creation of art-storage facilities at the airport.

""UBS has proactively reached out to families to introduce the new policies and discuss what it means to them, how they can benefit and help them preserve wealth and legacy,"" Lo told the Post in an exclusive interview, adding that the measures touch on issues close to family offices such as investing, art and philanthropy.

""We are confident that these initiatives will positively shape Hong Kong's development as an international centre for family offices.""

Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po in his budget in February announced the government would allocate HK$100 million (US$12.8 million) to promote family offices, while in October, Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu set a target of attracting 200 large family offices to the city by 2025.

Story continues

Lo said the Hong Kong government's promotion came at the right time as many wealthy families in the West, Middle East and Asia are eyeing new markets to invest their wealth.

""We have seen more diversification in our clients' investments, particularly into alternatives, such as private markets and hedge funds, and across different markets,"" she said.

""We will continue to see the shift of investments from all over the world to Asia where growth is.""

The Asia-Pacific economy is expected to grow at 4.3 per cent in 2023, while mainland China's gross domestic product is expected to grow at 5.4 per cent this year, according to forecasts from UBS. The Chinese government has set a growth target of around 5 per cent of the nation's economy for 2023.

Patrick Tsang, chairman of Tsangs Group, who set up a family office in Hong Kong in 2017 with a focus on innovation and technology investments globally, urged the government to offer more tax incentives and introduce more measures to attract talent.

""To attract more family offices to Hong Kong, the government is on the right track, but it could do more [such as offer] more tax incentives, and make it easier not just for business owners but also for the people that they hire from overseas to get them to come over,"" Tsang said. ""We need to showcase the Greater Bay Area's attractiveness.""

Beijing introduced the Greater Bay Area project in February 2019 to turn nine cities in southern Guangdong province, Hong Kong and Macau into an integrated economic powerhouse.

Tsangs Group will continue to be based in Hong Kong and tap China and the Greater Bay Area, highlighting the importance of Hong Kong as a superconnector between China and the world.

""The government should work on promoting the [potential] of the Greater Bay Area, and the different kinds of investment opportunities it can bring,"" said Tsang.

https://www.ibtimes.com/european-exchanges-defensive-appeal-attracts-investors-after-bank-turmoil-3685926,European Exchanges' Defensive Appeal Attracts Investors After Bank Turmoil,"European exchange stocks stand to benefit from a spike in volatility surrounding the downfall of Credit Suisse, as some investors turn towards bourse operators attracted by their defensive qualities and modest valuations.

The exchanges' share price performance has lagged the region-wide STOXX 600 index by up to 13 percentage points since September, as investors chased banks, potentially a more attractive trade because of rising interest rates.

But after a quiet start to the year for trading activity, the turbulence in March is spurring some investors to shift their exposure as part of a wider shift away from banking into other sectors.

Spikes in bond and equity volatility could yield positive earning surprises for exchange companies during the upcoming reporting season, just when tightening credit conditions risk hitting economic growth, making defensive businesses like exchanges more attractive.

Exchange operators' shares have outperformed in the past few weeks, with traders and analysts pointing to signs of investors rotating into exchanges, partly at the expense of banks. Volume spikes tend to boost activity across trades processed by exchange operators.

""There's rotation, the most obvious and public example of this is in the price action,"" said Andrew Morgan, president at U.S.-based financial technology provider TS Imagine.

""Exchange operators are data and technology businesses with defensive utility-like features, while banks are highly cyclical and exposed to idiosyncratic business model risks"".

Equity trades across Euronext, which runs exchanges in seven big European centres from Paris to Amsterdam and Milan, reached the third-highest value in the company's history on March 17. Its average daily traded volumes in March were the highest in a year.

Swiss exchange SIX, at the epicentre of the turmoil around UBS's rescue of Credit Suisse, had a 44.6% jump in March turnover compared with February. Cash market turnover at Deutsche Boerse rose 23.7% last month versus February.

Average daily value traded at the London Stock Exchange (LSEG) rose 12.9% month-over-month in March. Thomson Reuters, which owns Reuters News, has been a shareholder in LSEG since 2021. LSEG also pays Reuters for news.

VOLATILITY BOOST

Evidence of any shift could be revealed when filings disclosing how mutual funds have tweaked their positions are published in a few weeks' time.

UBS research that uses the bank's prime brokerage data and other sources showed in April that investor ""crowding"" in exchange operators' stocks has been recovering from four-year lows.

Among financials in Europe, exchange stocks are the most positively correlated to volatility.

Banking turmoil and option expiries drove the Euro STOXX volatility index last month to its highest since October in a steep surge that quickly pared back. The MOVE index, a gauge of fixed-income volatility, hit 2008 levels and remains high.

""Investors tend to look at the exchanges as defensive names. In recessionary environments, we tend to see money being allocated increasingly to the exchanges,"" said Micheal Werner, senior equity analyst at UBS in London.

""The number of incoming calls I have had on the exchanges has certainly increased over the past two or three weeks as people are working at the allocations within the financial space of their portfolio,"" he added.

Werner said uncertainty over monetary policy should keep bond volatility elevated, supporting exchange stocks, while spikes in equity volatility tend to be bad for investment banking, M&A and customer fund flows at big universal banks.

Deutsche Boerse has rallied more than 10% since the bank turmoil started in March with the collapse of U.S. regional bank SVB. Deutsche Boerse shares hit a lifetime high on Thursday.

LSEG and Euronext have risen almost 8% and 4% respectively, while Amsterdam-based market maker Flow Traders, which also benefits from volatility, is up more than 13%.

Over the same period, European banks have lost around 12%.

Looking to the long term, some investors see the exchange industry benefiting from data demand.

And exchange valuations are near multi-year lows which suggests any downside could be limited.

Euronext trades at 14 times 12-month forward earnings and LSEG at 22 times, both an 18% discount to their five-year averages, as per Refinitiv Datastream.

U.S. rival Nasdaq Inc trades on a multiple of 20, just a 3% discount to its 5-year average and Intercontinental Exchange Inc which trades on a multiple of 19, is 4.7% below its 5-year average.

""Beyond being volatility beneficiaries, which makes them attractive within a diversified portfolio context, we also believe they are well-placed for data demand and consumption trends,"" said Thomas McGarrity, head of equities at RBC Wealth Management. ""We continue to like exchange stocks.""

https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/european-exchanges-defensive-appeal-attracts-investors-after-bank-turmoil-2023-04-14/,European exchanges' defensive appeal attracts investors after bank turmoil,"[1/3] Bull and bear symbols are seen in front of the German stock exchange (Deutsche Boerse) in Frankfurt, Germany, February 12, 2019. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo















MILAN/LONDON, April 14 (Reuters) - European exchange stocks stand to benefit from a spike in volatility surrounding the downfall of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), as some investors turn towards bourse operators attracted by their defensive qualities and modest valuations.

The exchanges' share price performance has lagged the region-wide STOXX 600 (.STOXX) index by up to 13 percentage points since September, as investors chased banks, potentially a more attractive trade because of rising interest rates (.SX7P).

But after a quiet start to the year for trading activity, the turbulence in March is spurring some investors to shift their exposure as part of a wider shift away from banking into other sectors.

Spikes in bond and equity volatility could yield positive earning surprises for exchange companies during the upcoming reporting season, just when tightening credit conditions risk hitting economic growth, making defensive businesses like exchanges more attractive.

Exchange operators' shares have outperformed in the past few weeks, with traders and analysts pointing to signs of investors rotating into exchanges, partly at the expense of banks. Volume spikes tend to boost activity across trades processed by exchange operators.

""There's rotation, the most obvious and public example of this is in the price action,"" said Andrew Morgan, president at U.S.-based financial technology provider TS Imagine.

""Exchange operators are data and technology businesses with defensive utility-like features, while banks are highly cyclical and exposed to idiosyncratic business model risks"".

Equity trades across Euronext (ENX.PA), which runs exchanges in seven big European centres from Paris to Amsterdam and Milan, reached the third-highest value in the company's history on March 17. Its average daily traded volumes in March were the highest in a year.

Swiss exchange SIX, at the epicentre of the turmoil around UBS's (UBSG.S) rescue of Credit Suisse, had a 44.6% jump in March turnover compared with February. Cash market turnover at Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) rose 23.7% last month versus February.

Average daily value traded at the London Stock Exchange (LSEG) (LSEG.L) rose 12.9% month-over-month in March. Thomson Reuters, which owns Reuters News, has been a shareholder in LSEG since 2021. LSEG also pays Reuters for news.

VOLATILITY BOOST

Evidence of any shift could be revealed when filings disclosing how mutual funds have tweaked their positions are published in a few weeks' time.

UBS research that uses the bank's prime brokerage data and other sources showed in April that investor ""crowding"" in exchange operators' stocks has been recovering from four-year lows.

Among financials in Europe, exchange stocks are the most positively correlated to volatility.

Banking turmoil and option expiries drove the Euro STOXX volatility index (.V2TX) last month to its highest since October in a steep surge that quickly pared back. The MOVE index (.MOVE), a gauge of fixed-income volatility, hit 2008 levels and remains high.

""Investors tend to look at the exchanges as defensive names. In recessionary environments, we tend to see money being allocated increasingly to the exchanges,"" said Micheal Werner, senior equity analyst at UBS in London.

""The number of incoming calls I have had on the exchanges has certainly increased over the past two or three weeks as people are working at the allocations within the financial space of their portfolio,"" he added.

Werner said uncertainty over monetary policy should keep bond volatility elevated, supporting exchange stocks, while spikes in equity volatility tend to be bad for investment banking, M&A and customer fund flows at big universal banks.

Deutsche Boerse has rallied more than 10% since the bank turmoil started in March with the collapse of U.S. regional bank SVB. Deutsche Boerse shares hit a lifetime high on Thursday.

LSEG and Euronext have risen almost 8% and 4% respectively, while Amsterdam-based market maker Flow Traders (FLOW.AS), which also benefits from volatility, is up more than 13%.

Over the same period, European banks have lost around 12%.

Looking to the long term, some investors see the exchange industry benefiting from data demand.

And exchange valuations are near multi-year lows which suggests any downside could be limited.

Euronext trades at 14 times 12-month forward earnings and LSEG at 22 times, both an 18% discount to their five-year averages, as per Refinitiv Datastream.

U.S. rival Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) trades on a multiple of 20, just a 3% discount to its 5-year average and Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N) which trades on a multiple of 19, is 4.7% below its 5-year average.

""Beyond being volatility beneficiaries, which makes them attractive within a diversified portfolio context, we also believe they are well-placed for data demand and consumption trends,"" said Thomas McGarrity, head of equities at RBC Wealth Management. ""We continue to like exchange stocks.""

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS's multi-billion state-sponsored takeover of Credit Suisse should proceed smoothly without political obstructions, Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said in an interview published on Saturday.

The Swiss parliament is due to hold an extraordinary session next week to discuss the emergency merger engineered by the Swiss authorities after Credit Suisse came close to collapse.

Nearly 260 billion Swiss francs ($287 billion) of liquidity support and state guarantees have been offered to back the takeover and avoid a financial meltdown the bank's uncontrolled failure could have triggered.

""There is a merger agreement between UBS and CS, for its part the cabinet has made a commitment to the national bank to provide CS with liquidity in order to ensure stability,"" Keller-Sutter told newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft.

""The guarantee agreement with UBS is still being negotiated. In many committee meetings, I got the impression that politicians definitely don't want to jeopardise the takeover,"" she added.

""I don't see any stumbling blocks at the moment.""

Completing the merger was the highest priority, the minister said, who defended the government's intervention last month, which critics have said came too late and promised too much taxpayer support for a bank that paid out billions in bonuses to executives.

""The primary goal of the Federal Council was to ensure the stability of the Swiss economy and the Swiss financial center and to prevent an international financial crisis,"" she said.

""Under the circumstances, it was and is the best possible choice, which also places the least burden on the state and the taxpayer,"" Keller-Sutter said.

The new combined bank will have $1.6 trillion in assets - double the size of the entire Swiss economy - and more than 120,000 staff and Keller-Sutter said the structure of UBS would have to be considered in the future.

""UBS will have to hold more equity after the takeover. This will rather force them to shrink,"" Keller-Sutter said.

Switzerland's Competition Commission can also make recommendations, the minister added.

The risks to the taxpayer were also acceptable - even though the government could assume up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS by the takeover.

Keller-Sutter criticised the culture at Credit Suisse, which she said had set the wrong incentives and had not learned from previous scandals and prosecutions.

The minister also defended the writedown of AT1 bonds to zero, a controversial part of the rescue.

""These are high-risk bonds with high yields, sometimes over 9%,"" Keller-Sutter said. ""The prospectus for these bonds makes it clear that if a company claims indirect government aid, they can be written off.""

The special parliamentary session next week was important, she added, and a welcome opportunity to get to the truth of the Credit Suisse debacle.

""At the moment, parliament can 'only' advise on the commitment credit, but it also has the opportunity to comment on the case and play an active role in the process.""

Asian equities rose and the dollar dipped further Friday after fresh data showing continued slowing of inflation fanned hopes the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its long-running campaign of interest rate hikes.

The surprise on-month drop in producer prices in March — and the biggest since April 2020 — came a day after the consumer price index dropped more than expected, suggesting the central bank’s tightening campaign was finally paying off.

A higher-than-forecast reading on jobless claims added to the positive mood, which helped send Wall Street’s three main indexes rallying, including a two percent advance for the Nasdaq.

Investors are now betting the Fed will hike rates 25 basis points at its May gathering but possibly hold after that, with some still clinging to hopes it will even cut by the end of the year.

This week’s data has reassured investors that inflation is coming down and that the economy could be heading for a soft landing, even though minutes from the Fed’s March policy meeting revealed some officials see a mild recession by the year’s end.

“Coming fast on the heels of yesterday’s better-than-expected (consumer prices) reading, today’s (producer price index) print, plus the in-line jobless claims report, reinforces the view that the labour market continues to rebalance and that the post-pandemic inflation scare is ending,” said SPI Asset Management’s Stephen Innes.

“And as we move into the seventh-inning stretch, where arguably much could happen between now and the final pitch, the combination of progress on inflation and the softer labour market has been encouraging.

“It reinforces the view that the Fed may be in the 9th inning of the hiking cycle, which markets seem to be endorsing today as yields on 10-year Treasuries declined.”

Asian equities rose in early trade Friday, with Tokyo leading the way followed by Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei, Manila and Jakarta.

“Inflation is not surprising to the upside,” Que Nguyen, at Research Affiliates, said.

“At the same time, the job market seems stable. And so what we’re getting today is sort of an optimistic outlook that we’re going to have an almost like a Goldilocks situation where inflation’s going to slow, but the economy is not crashing.”

With Thursday’s data lowering expectations for where rates will top out, the dollar has come under pressure, hitting a one-year low against the euro. And it continued to struggle Friday, falling further versus the single currency, while the pound was at its best level since June.

Focus now turns to the corporate earnings season, which kicks off in earnest Friday with results from banking titans including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup.

Traders are keenly awaiting their outlook statements in light of the upheaval in the banking sector last month that saw three US lenders go under and Credit Suisse bought by rival UBS.

Oil prices rose in Asian business, extending a rally sparked by major producers’ decision this month to slash output by more than a million barrels a day.

The OPEC+ group said Thursday the move had put world markets on course to be in deficit, which will widen as the year goes on, with China’s reopening adding extra pressure.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-blackrock-sells-asset-backed-220807279.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,UPDATE 2-BlackRock sells asset-backed bonds from Credit Suisse's books- Bloomberg News,"(Adds Credit Suisse's response)

April 13 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Group AG has hired BlackRock Inc to help sell a portfolio of structured bonds for the Swiss bank, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.

BlackRock's Financial Markets Advisory group has been selling off securities over the last two weeks, including pieces of collateralized loan obligations, commercial mortgage bonds and niche asset-backed debt, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

BlackRock and Credit Suisse declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.

The move comes after the Swiss lender was acquired by UBS Group AG in a state-brokered deal.

Earlier this month, U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) retained BlackRock's unit to sell the securities portfolios it kept in receivership after the collapse of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank.

In March, law firm Pallas Partners told Reuters that they along with a Swiss council were working on possible legal action on behalf of some Credit Suisse AT1 bond investors whose holdings were wiped out following the bank's takeover.

What Happened: At an extraordinary government session held to discuss the lender's collapse, 102 parliamentarians voted against the measure, reported Reuters.

The votes are, however, largely symbolic as the government has committed the funds and lawmakers cannot overturn that decision.

Switzerland’s upper house had voted in favor of the government guarantees, earlier on Tuesday.

Describing the transaction as “the first merger of two globally systematically important banks,” Chairman Colm Kelleher sought to assure investors that it also meant “a new beginning and huge opportunities ahead for the combined bank and the Swiss financial center as a whole.”

MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - European exchange stocks stand to benefit from a spike in volatility surrounding the downfall of Credit Suisse, as some investors turn towards bourse operators attracted by their defensive qualities and modest valuations.

The exchanges' share price performance has lagged the region-wide STOXX 600 index by up to 13 percentage points since September, as investors chased banks, potentially a more attractive trade because of rising interest rates.

But after a quiet start to the year for trading activity, the turbulence in March is spurring some investors to shift their exposure as part of a wider shift away from banking into other sectors.

Spikes in bond and equity volatility could yield positive earning surprises for exchange companies during the upcoming reporting season, just when tightening credit conditions risk hitting economic growth, making defensive businesses like exchanges more attractive.

Exchange operators' shares have outperformed in the past few weeks, with traders and analysts pointing to signs of investors rotating into exchanges, partly at the expense of banks. Volume spikes tend to boost activity across trades processed by exchange operators.

""There's rotation, the most obvious and public example of this is in the price action,"" said Andrew Morgan, president at U.S.-based financial technology provider TS Imagine.

""Exchange operators are data and technology businesses with defensive utility-like features, while banks are highly cyclical and exposed to idiosyncratic business model risks"".

Equity trades across Euronext, which runs exchanges in seven big European centres from Paris to Amsterdam and Milan, reached the third-highest value in the company's history on March 17. Its average daily traded volumes in March were the highest in a year.

Swiss exchange SIX, at the epicentre of the turmoil around UBS's rescue of Credit Suisse, had a 44.6% jump in March turnover compared with February. Cash market turnover at Deutsche Boerse rose 23.7% last month versus February.

Average daily value traded at the London Stock Exchange (LSEG) rose 12.9% month-over-month in March. Thomson Reuters, which owns Reuters News, has been a shareholder in LSEG since 2021. LSEG also pays Reuters for news.

VOLATILITY BOOST

Evidence of any shift could be revealed when filings disclosing how mutual funds have tweaked their positions are published in a few weeks' time.

UBS research that uses the bank's prime brokerage data and other sources showed in April that investor ""crowding"" in exchange operators' stocks has been recovering from four-year lows.

Among financials in Europe, exchange stocks are the most positively correlated to volatility.

Banking turmoil and option expiries drove the Euro STOXX volatility index last month to its highest since October in a steep surge that quickly pared back. The MOVE index, a gauge of fixed-income volatility, hit 2008 levels and remains high.

""Investors tend to look at the exchanges as defensive names. In recessionary environments, we tend to see money being allocated increasingly to the exchanges,"" said Micheal Werner, senior equity analyst at UBS in London.

""The number of incoming calls I have had on the exchanges has certainly increased over the past two or three weeks as people are working at the allocations within the financial space of their portfolio,"" he added.

Werner said uncertainty over monetary policy should keep bond volatility elevated, supporting exchange stocks, while spikes in equity volatility tend to be bad for investment banking, M&A and customer fund flows at big universal banks.

Deutsche Boerse has rallied more than 10% since the bank turmoil started in March with the collapse of U.S. regional bank SVB. Deutsche Boerse shares hit a lifetime high on Thursday.

LSEG and Euronext have risen almost 8% and 4% respectively, while Amsterdam-based market maker Flow Traders, which also benefits from volatility, is up more than 13%.

Over the same period, European banks have lost around 12%.

Looking to the long term, some investors see the exchange industry benefiting from data demand.

And exchange valuations are near multi-year lows which suggests any downside could be limited.

Euronext trades at 14 times 12-month forward earnings and LSEG at 22 times, both an 18% discount to their five-year averages, as per Refinitiv Datastream.

U.S. rival Nasdaq Inc trades on a multiple of 20, just a 3% discount to its 5-year average and Intercontinental Exchange Inc which trades on a multiple of 19, is 4.7% below its 5-year average.

""Beyond being volatility beneficiaries, which makes them attractive within a diversified portfolio context, we also believe they are well-placed for data demand and consumption trends,"" said Thomas McGarrity, head of equities at RBC Wealth Management. ""We continue to like exchange stocks.""

The Swiss parliament is due to hold an extraordinary session next week to discuss the emergency merger engineered by the Swiss authorities after Credit Suisse came close to collapse.

Nearly 260 billion Swiss francs ($287 billion) of liquidity support and state guarantees have been offered to back the takeover and avoid a financial meltdown the bank’s uncontrolled failure could have triggered.

“There is a merger agreement between UBS and CS, for its part the cabinet has made a commitment to the national bank to provide CS with liquidity in order to ensure stability,” Keller-Sutter told newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft.

“The guarantee agreement with UBS is still being negotiated. In many committee meetings, I got the impression that politicians definitely don’t want to jeopardise the takeover,” she added.

“I don’t see any stumbling blocks at the moment.”

Completing the merger was the highest priority, the minister said, who defended the government’s intervention last month, which critics have said came too late and promised too much taxpayer support for a bank that paid out billions in bonuses to executives.

“The primary goal of the Federal Council was to ensure the stability of the Swiss economy and the Swiss financial center and to prevent an international financial crisis,” she said.

“Under the circumstances, it was and is the best possible choice, which also places the least burden on the state and the taxpayer,” Keller-Sutter said.

The new combined bank will have $1.6 trillion in assets – double the size of the entire Swiss economy – and more than 120,000 staff and Keller-Sutter said the structure of UBS would have to be considered in the future.

“UBS will have to hold more equity after the takeover. This will rather force them to shrink,” Keller-Sutter said.

Switzerland’s Competition Commission can also make recommendations, the minister added.

The risks to the taxpayer were also acceptable – even though the government could assume up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS by the takeover.

Keller-Sutter criticised the culture at Credit Suisse, which she said had set the wrong incentives and had not learned from previous scandals and prosecutions.

The minister also defended the writedown of AT1 bonds to zero, a controversial part of the rescue.

“These are high-risk bonds with high yields, sometimes over 9%,” Keller-Sutter said. “The prospectus for these bonds makes it clear that if a company claims indirect government aid, they can be written off.”

The special parliamentary session next week was important, she added, and a welcome opportunity to get to the truth of the Credit Suisse debacle.

“At the moment, parliament can ‘only’ advise on the commitment credit, but it also has the opportunity to comment on the case and play an active role in the process.”

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/more-50-000-retail-stores-164600500.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,"More than 50,000 retail stores to close in 5 years: Wall Street","The past year has seen 2,000 retail store closures, with the likes of Bed Bath & Beyond, Foot Locker and Walmart shuttering locations as they look to save money. But that trickle is set to turn into a flood in the next five years, according to one Wall Street analysis that predicts 50,000 stores will close.

If the economy falls into a prolonged recession, closures could reach 90,000, analysts at UBS said in a research note published Tuesday. Smaller operations that employ 500 or fewer people are most likely to close, they wrote.

The U.S. currently has roughly 940,000 stores and the UBS prediction ""simply implies that there will be 5% fewer stores by the end of 2027,"" analysts said.

The forecast is particularly troubling because, according to the National Retail Federation, about 70% of retail sales still come from brick-and-mortar stores, meaning retailers could suffer greater losses once they close off the places where customers physically stroll and shop.

UBS pointed to three factors causing retail locations to close: the ever-growing prominence of online shopping; increased borrowing costs and customers tightening their wallets due to inflation.

Stubbornly high inflation in recent months has pinched household budgets, causing consumers to pay elevated prices for everyday staples like gas, groceries, clothes and housing.

Clothing, electronics and home furnishing stores will likely bear the brunt of closings in the coming years because more of their shoppers will opt to purchase those items online, UBS said. They project closures of 13,840 clothing stores, 9,190 electronics locations and 4,090 furniture stores.

By comparison, UBS expects home improvement stores to lose only 210 locations and auto parts stores to stay steady. Both job growth and year-over-year sales have increased at home improvement and auto parts stores, UBS said — two reasons why that sector of retail likely won't suffer as many closings in the future.

Story continues

Major retailers — including Costco, Home Depot, Lowe's and Target — stand to benefit the most from the predicted store closings, UBS said. The closings of smaller operators would mean roughly $210 billion in retail sales would be up for grabs, analysts said.

""This translates to $1,600 annual spend per household that has the potential to shift to the leading retailers,"" UBS analysts said.

Some major retailers are already well into the closing spree. Companies shuttered about 1,500 stores last fall, UBS noted.

Bed Bath & Beyond said it plans to close nearly 240 stores this year as part of a larger effort to avoid bankruptcy. Walmart is closing more than a dozen low-performing locations in major cities like Atlanta, Chicago, Portland and Washington, D.C. Foot Locker said last month it plans to close 400 mall-based stores by 2026 and open more than 300 free-standing locations.",['Khristopher J. Brooks'],
https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/11/analysts-worry-about-microsofts-cloud-but-really-like-humana.html,Analysts worry about Microsoft's cloud but really like Humana. Here's our take on both Club stocks,"UBS analysts are warning about additional weakness in Microsoft 's (MSFT) key cloud computing, while Morgan Stanley issued a rosy multiyear outlook on Humana (HUM). Here's a look at both notes and how we feel about the stocks, which are both in the Club's portfolio. MSFT 1Y mountain Microsoft's stock performance over the past 12 months. The news: UBS is warning that Microsoft could issue worse-than-expected guidance for its Azure cloud unit later this month after it reports fiscal 2023 third-quarter results. Ahead of all that, UBS lowered its own Azuze revenue growth estimates for Microsoft's fourth-quarter and upcoming fiscal year 2024. In a note to clients Monday night, UBS said it now expects Microsoft's cloud computing unit to grow revenue by 24% in its Q4, which ends June 30 due to a weird financial calendar. That's down from prior estimates of 25%. For Microsoft's full-year 2024 — which actually runs from July 2023 to June 2024 — UBS now sees Azure revenue growth of 20%, down from 21.6%. UBS said it believes softer demand for cloud computing services ""will be deeper and last longer than most think,"" citing conversations with about 20 Amazon Web Services and Azure customers. On the other hand, analysts at UBS acknowledged Microsoft's commentary around plans to monetize its OpenAI investment, saying it could be ""as impactful to the stock as the reported financials."" UBS has a neutral rating and 12-month price target of $275 on Microsoft shares. The stock traded around $283 per share Tuesday. The Club's take: A general slowdown in cloud computing spending is hardly a surprise to technology investors. After all, Azure's growth rate has slowed in recent prints: 31% in the company's fiscal 2023 second quarter compared with 35% and 40% in the prior two quarters. UBS said it's comfortable with estimated Q3 Azure growth of 30 to 31%. Likewise, market-leading Amazon Web Services — part of fellow Club holding Amazon (AMZN) — has seen its growth moderate materially, slowing to 20% in the three months ended Dec. 31. What UBS' note suggests is that in the near term Azure's growth could slow even further in the coming quarters and reach a trajectory similar to AWS. While we understand cloud computing is vulnerable to a slowdown, we remain long-term believers in Microsoft. And, it's important to remember nowadays, investors are paying closer attention to the bottom lines of technology giants; topline growth isn't the singular focus anymore. So, while Azure growth may continue to moderate, Microsoft's earnings per share (EPS) may be more resilient as the company's expense-reduction strategy, which included layoffs , filters through the organization. HUM 1Y mountain Humana's 12 month stock performance. The news: Club holding Humana is the ""strongest earnings growth story"" in the managed care industry, Morgan Stanley equity analysts told clients in a note Tuesday. The firm, which has a buy-equivalent rating on Humana, raised its price target on the stock to $637 per share from $620, representing more than 20% upside from its Monday close. Analysts rolled out their full-year 2025 EPS forecast of $40, which they said is the highest on Wall Street. The company itself is projecting earnings of $37 per share for 2025. Morgan Stanley's favorable multiyear outlook is rooted in the strength of Humana's Medicare Advantage offering. Humana has raised membership growth guidance four times since September, which analysts argue should ""significantly"" strengthen the company's earnings power in the coming years. Additionally, they said Humana's $1 billion value creation program is going better than expected, opening the door for even more upside to management's 2025 earnings target. The Club's take: We've been fans of Humana for more than a year now, believing management is capable of turning the ship around after a rough 2022 Medicare Advantage enrollment and recapturing lost market share. The company's recent results and guidance boosts have confirmed our thesis is playing out. We're glad to see Morgan Stanley analysts expect this to continue in the future. HUM shares are only about 7% away from their all-time intraday high of $571.30, which came back in early November. One thing to keep in mind in the near term: Humana's managed care peer, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), releases earnings Friday morning, and the quality of UNH's print could influence sentiment around Humana ahead of its own report April 26. The Club prefers Humana over Dow stock UnitedHealth because of its turnaround-story characteristics and the fact its more of a pure-play stock on Medicare Advantage. With investors worried about the U.S. economy weakening and this year's regulatory hurdles largely behind the sector, Humana is the kind of defensive stock that shines in moments like this.

Asian equities rose and the dollar dipped further Friday after fresh data showing continued slowing of inflation fanned hopes the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its long-running campaign of interest rate hikes.

The surprise on-month drop in producer prices in March — and the biggest since April 2020 — came a day after the consumer price index dropped more than expected, suggesting the central bank’s tightening campaign was finally paying off.

A higher-than-forecast reading on jobless claims added to the positive mood, which helped send Wall Street’s three main indexes rallying, including a two percent advance for the Nasdaq.

Investors are now betting the Fed will hike rates 25 basis points at its May gathering but possibly hold after that, with some still clinging to hopes it will even cut by the end of the year.

This week’s data has reassured investors that inflation is coming down and that the economy could be heading for a soft landing, even though minutes from the Fed’s March policy meeting revealed some officials see a mild recession by the year’s end.

“Coming fast on the heels of yesterday’s better-than-expected (consumer prices) reading, today’s (producer price index) print, plus the in-line jobless claims report, reinforces the view that the labour market continues to rebalance and that the post-pandemic inflation scare is ending,” said SPI Asset Management’s Stephen Innes.

“And as we move into the seventh-inning stretch, where arguably much could happen between now and the final pitch, the combination of progress on inflation and the softer labour market has been encouraging.

“It reinforces the view that the Fed may be in the 9th inning of the hiking cycle, which markets seem to be endorsing today as yields on 10-year Treasuries declined.”

Asian equities rose in early trade Friday, with Tokyo leading the way followed by Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei, Manila and Jakarta.

“Inflation is not surprising to the upside,” Que Nguyen, at Research Affiliates, said.

“At the same time, the job market seems stable. And so what we’re getting today is sort of an optimistic outlook that we’re going to have an almost like a Goldilocks situation where inflation’s going to slow, but the economy is not crashing.”

With Thursday’s data lowering expectations for where rates will top out, the dollar has come under pressure, hitting a one-year low against the euro. And it continued to struggle Friday, falling further versus the single currency, while the pound was at its best level since June.

Focus now turns to the corporate earnings season, which kicks off in earnest Friday with results from banking titans including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup.

Traders are keenly awaiting their outlook statements in light of the upheaval in the banking sector last month that saw three US lenders go under and Credit Suisse bought by rival UBS.

Oil prices rose in Asian business, extending a rally sparked by major producers’ decision this month to slash output by more than a million barrels a day.

The OPEC+ group said Thursday the move had put world markets on course to be in deficit, which will widen as the year goes on, with China’s reopening adding extra pressure.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swiss-government-set-grilling-over-040000444.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,Swiss Government Set for Grilling Over UBS-Credit Suisse Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Less than a month after forcing through the creation of a Swiss banking juggernaut, the country’s government is set to be grilled in parliament this week.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Lawmakers gather on Tuesday for a special session after ministers led by President Alain Berset agreed to provide up to 109 billion francs ($120 billion) in taxpayer money to support the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG by UBS Group AG.

While parliament can do little to derail the deal, lawmakers are still likely to try to push the government to overhaul too-big-to-fail rules and pursue legal action against management at Credit Suisse. It’s unclear at this point which executives might be targeted.

Given the merger has been met with little public enthusiasm and it’s an election year, there’s likely to be plenty of political grandstanding on display.

Here’s what you need to know:

Why is parliament meeting?

The government pushed through the takeover by emergency law, so parliament — just like shareholders — didn’t get a say. Yet the deal included pledges of public funds, allowing lawmakers to call a special session.

The debate is likely more about saving face politically than actually changing things, but MPs do have the opportunity to give the government a hard time.

It’s fairly rare that the Swiss parliament — which typically meets just 12 weeks each year — schedules a special gathering unconnected to its regular timetable, notable cases include those on Covid measures and on the bankruptcy of national carrier Swissair in 2001.

Why won’t parliament be able to stop the deal?

During the weekend the takeover was negotiated, the government had a small group of senior MPs — the so-called financial delegation — sign off on the deal. That six-member body can agree to urgent fiscal matters on behalf of parliament.

Story continues

The administration has said that lawmakers can’t reverse the decision of the delegation: “If parliament refuses subsequent approval, it will be tantamount to a political reprimand for the financial delegation, with no legal effect.”

What else is on the table?

Given that the bank bailout isn’t popular among the Swiss public, lawmakers want to restrict the government’s leeway in executing the deal. They will try to do so by inserting provisions into amendments to the budget, which are needed to account for the potential public spending on the banks.

Proposed conditions include that the government shouldn’t freely be able to extend state guarantees above the agreed 109 billion francs, and should exhaust all legal options against responsible managers at Credit Suisse.

MPs are also demanding an overhaul of Switzerland’s too-big-to-fail regulation for systemically relevant banks, given that existing framework didn’t prevent the crisis. The second-biggest party in parliament, the center-left Social Democrats, have said they will only approve the state aid if the government publicly commits to new rules which would prevent a case like Credit Suisse in the future.

What is going to happen when?

The session is scheduled for three days from Tuesday through Thursday, but Tuesday will be the main day of debate.

Upper house: 11:15 a.m. to 3 p.m. local time

Lower house: 5:15 p.m. — no ending time specified

Both debates start with a government address to which MPs will then respond. The discussion of the proposed amendments to the budget bill will take place subsequently.

How will the crisis influence the October elections?

As a reminder: Switzerland’s executive isn’t made up of a coalition or an outright majority, but of seven ministers from the country’s four largest parties. They usually make decisions by consensus and try to find pragmatic compromises — often outside of party lines.

Ministers don’t publicly oppose government decisions, irrespective of their parties’ stance on a matter or how they personally voted behind closed doors.

This setup means that parliament offers parties the most high-profile platform to sway voters.

According to polls, Berset’s Social Democrats are considered more credible than any of the other parties related to the crisis, which helps explains their aggressive stance in parliament. By contrast, voters are the least impressed with the pro-business liberals of Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter.

But the players and fans who were a part of it knew the deal, and it sure felt like one.

Facing what essentially was an elimination game, the Islanders did what they had to do on Wednesday night, beating the Canadiens, 4-2, to clinch a wild-card spot.

And they did it before a jazzed but tense crowd that knew the stakes and acted accordingly.

It was a hockey party unlike any previously seen at the new barn. When it was over, the scoreboard at center ice said it all in big, bold, white letters: “CLINCHED.”

The Islanders will play their first official playoff game at their two-seasons-old arena in Game 3 of a first-round series against either the Bruins or Hurricanes.

“The crowd was great,” captain Anders Lee said. “Looking forward to hearing them in the playoffs. They really brought it this evening, and that’s huge.”

Said Zach Parise, “It was awesome. It was a great atmosphere in there and I think we’re all as a team looking forward to that carrying over into the postseason.”

Wednesday night’s fun will not change the fact there is work to do on Lou Lamoriello’s aging, less-than-fast roster, or the fact anything other than a deep playoff run would be difficult to spin as a positive season.

But before all that let us take a moment to acknowledge the Islanders’ immediate accomplishment, which deserves a stick tap.

This was a team that, after a 2-8-3 stretch to start the new calendar year, found itself six points out of a playoff spot and looked hopeless.

At the time, I wrote that “Lamoriello and his band of aging Islanders deserve the opportunity to somehow wriggle out of this mess.”

And this: “No one should expect this team to go quietly, not after all it has been through in recent years.”

It did not, even after losing its most dynamic skater, Mathew Barzal, on Feb. 18.

Lamoriello made moves, notably acquiring Bo Horvat from the Canucks, key players returned from injury, notably Adam Pelech, and it was just enough.

“We made a commitment to putting ourselves in the position to have the opportunity we had tonight, and we did that,” Lee said.

“Guys put in a lot of work, we played extremely hard and we got our foot in the door, a seat at the table . . . We knew we had a hill to climb.”

Parise said, “We potentially got written off a little bit when Barzy went down, and we rallied and put together a pretty good record from them on to put ourselves in this spot.”

It appeared the Islanders had blown it on Monday.

They gave up control of their playoff future by losing, 5-2, to a Capitals team that had lost six games in row. Inexplicable.

Then came Tuesday night, when something even less explicable happened.

The Penguins, now in control, lost at home to lowly Chicago, 5-2, a team presumed to be angling for the worst record in the NHL to help its draft position.

Nope. Pittsburgh had to win and lost, endangering its 16-year playoff streak. Chicago had to lose and won.

“Crazy how fast things can change,” Noah Dobson said. “Leaving Washington, it was a complete 180 to how we’re feeling tonight.”

With four minutes left on Wednesday, Lee’s power-play goal made it 4-2, and the celebration was on. Fans rose and began a loud chorus of “Let’s go, Islanders!”

The Islanders could have lost and still made the playoffs if the Penguins lost to the Blue Jackets on Thursday, but it was far better this way.

Montreal came into the game with a 31-43-6 record, with one victory in its last five games and having been outscored 15-1 in its three most recent losses.

The Islanders escaped the trap this time, and now it is on to the playoffs.

There is no time to waste for Lamoriello’s experienced crew, which has been aiming all season for another run at a Stanley Cup before time catches up with them.

The clincher did not solve all their problems. Not even close. But after getting a gift on Tuesday, the Islanders were not about to return it on Wednesday.

“I’m sure you could point to a lot of different times in the season that got us here,” Parise said. “But here we are.”",['Neil Best'],2023-04-13 02:34:54.159000+00:00

Keith Yandle walked into coffee shops when he played hockey in New York and would hear people talking about the next Rangers game against the Islanders or the New Jersey Devils.

“When you play those teams, even during the regular season, it adds a little bit more,” Yandle said. “Those are fun rivalries.”

Take those rivalries and add the prospect of elimination. The results could mean a spring sports scene in the Big Apple area that hasn’t happened in almost three decades.

All three New York-area teams are in the NHL playoffs this year — just the fourth time that has happened and the first since 2007. Add in the NBA’s Knicks and Brooklyn Nets and it’s the first time the city’s five indoor major professional teams all qualified for the postseason since 1994, when the Rangers lifted the Stanley Cup.

The Devils and Rangers could face off in the playoffs for the first time since the 2012 Eastern Conference final. And given the teams’ young talent and potential, it’s easy to envision a championship parade coming to New York or North Jersey in the not-too-distant future.

“It’s awesome for the sport,” said former Penguins forward Brian Boyle, who also played for the Rangers and Devils before retiring and joining NHL Network. “The passion, that’s what drives it. That’s what makes sports great, and they have that right there. And when they’re all doing fairly well — there’s no doormats now — it’s exciting.”

Much like Major League Baseball’s Subway Series between the Yankees and Mets, the mix of contending hockey teams in New York makes for interesting tension in the stands and in local establishments showing the games on TV.

“You’re cheering against your neighbors, your cousins, your family,” said Islanders forward Kyle Palmieri, who also played for the Devils after growing up in New Jersey. “Everyone kind of has their own alliances.”

Because of that, visiting fans bleed into the crowd more easily than in other markets. But Zach Parise, now with the Islanders after captaining the Devils to the Cup Final in 2012, said it doesn’t feel at all like a neutral-site game — certainly not in the playoffs.

“Both fanbases are so into it that they drown out the other half really quick,” Parise said.

Yandle, who broke the NHL’s consecutive games played record last season before retiring to join TNT, pointed out the New York-area teams all making the playoffs is good for the sport’s bottom line, too, from revenue to ratings.

Former goalie Kevin Weekes, who played for all three and now works for ESPN, said: “You can’t put a price on” playoff hockey at Madison Square Garden.

You can, and it’s over $350 on the secondary market just to get into the place known as “The World’s Most Famous Arena.”

It may be a little cheaper at Prudential Center in Newark or sparkling new UBS Arena at Belmont Park on Long Island, which will host a postseason game for the first time in its second year of existence after the Islanders clinched their spot Wednesday night.

No matter where the games are, at least for the first round, the eyes of the hockey community will be drawn to New York or New Jersey just about every night. That’s not something three-time Devils Stanley Cup-winning defenseman Ken Daneyko expected to experience again in his lifetime.

“When they do, all three in, it’s great for our market, for New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Long Island — you name it,” said Daneyko, who’s now an NHL Network analyst. “Hockey’s at the forefront, and that’s what we love, what we want.”

Beyond adding more banners to hang from the rafters, it also could be a boon for youth hockey in the area. Much like Palmieri, James and Trevor van Riemsdyk and others from New York and New Jersey wanted to be like Mark Messier and Brian Leetch, the next generation of kids playing could say the same about Adam Fox, Jack Hughes and the other stars playing for the Rangers, Devils and Islanders.

“It has come a long way,” Palmieri said. “You look at the rinks that are being built and the youth hockey teams that are popping up, the opportunities for guys to make it to higher levels is really awesome. Any time you generate buzz about hockey in that market, it’s doing well for youth hockey and everyone.”",['Associated Press'],2023-04-13 20:08:04-04:00

Investors to Inquire About Securities Class Action Investigation - SRPT","NEW YORK, April 13, 2023 /PRNewswire/ --

WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, continues investigating potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: SRPT) resulting from allegations that Sarepta may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Sarepta securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. The Rosen Law Firm is preparing a class action seeking recovery of investor losses.

WHAT IS THIS ABOUT: On March 16, 2023, after market hours, the Company issued a press release which ""announced that at its late cycle meeting for the SRP-9001 (delandistrogene moxeparvovec) biologics license application (BLA), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Office of Therapeutics (OTP) has determined that an advisory committee meeting will be held for SRP-9001 in advance of the May 29, 2023 regulatory action date.""

As explained by the Investor's Business Daily in an article entitled ""Sarepta Crashes on an Unexpected Roadblock for Its Gene Therapy"", the Food and Drug Administration's decision was a surprise. The article quoted a UBS analyst as saying that ""given the announcement of the advisory committee decision, against a backdrop of the Office of Therapeutics communicating how capacity constrained it is at every public appearance, we do see a potential risk of (approval date) extension.""

On this news, the price of Sarepta's stock fell $26.98, or 18%, to close at $122.69 per share on March 17, 2023, the next trading day.

WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, continues investigating potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: SRPT) resulting from allegations that Sarepta may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Sarepta securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. The Rosen Law Firm is preparing a class action seeking recovery of investor losses.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the prospective class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=1306 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

WHAT IS THIS ABOUT: On March 16, 2023, after market hours, the Company issued a press release which ""announced that at its late cycle meeting for the SRP-9001 (delandistrogene moxeparvovec) biologics license application (BLA), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Office of Therapeutics (OTP) has determined that an advisory committee meeting will be held for SRP-9001 in advance of the May 29, 2023 regulatory action date.""

As explained by the Investor's Business Daily in an article entitled ""Sarepta Crashes on an Unexpected Roadblock for Its Gene Therapy"", the Food and Drug Administration's decision was a surprise. The article quoted a UBS analyst as saying that ""given the announcement of the advisory committee decision, against a backdrop of the Office of Therapeutics communicating how capacity constrained it is at every public appearance, we do see a potential risk of (approval date) extension.""

On this news, the price of Sarepta's stock fell $26.98, or 18%, to close at $122.69 per share on March 17, 2023, the next trading day.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

https://nypost.com/2023/04/13/inside-the-emotions-the-islanders-rode-to-the-playoffs-again/,Why the emotional roller-coaster the Islanders rode to the playoffs feels awfully familiar,"Jeff Tambellini remembers the night before the 2006-07 regular-season finale, as the Islanders sat around the TV at a Newark hotel to watch “Hockey Night in Canada.”

In order to have a chance to get into the playoffs the next day, the Islanders needed the Maple Leafs to beat the Canadiens. Then they needed to beat the Devils to keep Toronto out.

The Maple Leafs opened a 3-1 lead, blew it to go down 5-3, then stormed back to win 6-5. The door was open.

“As a young player watching some of our leaders … it’s such a veteran group and just watching their emotions go as we were watching Toronto-Montreal, and then for it to finish and now we have a chance to get back in,” Tambellini, a left-winger on that team, told The Post Wednesday afternoon. “Me as a player, that’s really all you can ask for, is to control your own destiny on the last day of the season.”

Jeff Tambellini and the Islanders had already had an emotional night waiting to see if they would have a chance to qualify for the 2007 playoffs before going out and beating the Devils to actually do so the next day. Getty Images

Sound familiar?

The current group of Islanders, who channeled the 2007 team in clinching a playoff berth on the last day of the season with a 4-2 victory over the Canadiens on Wednesday, was scattered at their respective homes on Tuesday night as the Penguins lost to the Blackhawks. Some of them got to their televisions. All of them heard about it.

“I decided not to tune into that one,” Noah Dobson said. “But I was checking the score periodically and I turned it on. … It’s an opportunity where, yesterday in the morning you wake up and it’s like, oh, you’re a little down. Obviously, to see that kinda gives you a little energy and life.”

“I watched a movie (“American Hustle”) downstairs,” Islanders coach Lane Lambert said, “and my wife watched the game upstairs and sent me updates.”

Like in 2007, they got to the rink on the last day of the season knowing they would get into the playoffs with a win.

The Islanders of 16 years ago had gone through what Richard Park would, on Wednesday night, call an “unorthodox” season, starting with Garth Snow replacing Neil Smith as general manager just 41 days after Smith was hired and including a late-March injury to goaltender Rick DiPietro that seemed to spell doom for the team’s playoff chances.

As the stretch run unfolded, with every game being a must-win, injuries dictated that Wade Dubielewicz was in nets. And, heading into Game 82 in New Jersey, Dubielewicz had won the Islanders three straight games, with the best yet to come.

The Devils, who had already locked up their playoff seeding, sat Martin Brodeur for just the fourth time that season, and Park scored twice to give the Islanders a 2-0 lead early in the third. But the lead wouldn’t last.

“There’s a buzz in the building ’cause it means so much to our team,” Tambellini said. “We had a lot of fans that night in New Jersey, and then we get up [2-0] and now we’re hanging on. And you can feel when a team’s hanging on, and we get down to that last minute and they score and tie it, and you can just feel the life kind of come out of the group a little bit.”

One point would not be enough for the Islanders. And the game would soon go into a shootout.

That was where Dubielewicz became an Islanders folk hero.

On the bench, the Islanders knew that Dubielewicz’s go-to move in a shootout was the poke check. They’d seen him do it in practice. But to pull it out with the season on the line was another matter entirely.

Wade Dubielewicz led the Islanders to four straight wins in the spring of 2007 to reach the playoffs, where they eventually lost to the Sabres in the first round. Getty Images

“Honestly, it was the most annoying thing ever as a shooter to come down and have this little, I don’t want to say a dinky poke check, but you can kind of stomach when the goalie makes a save on you,” Park told The Post. “A poke check, it’s not a great feeling, but he was really good at it.”

Dubielewicz stopped Brian Gionta with a poke check. Then he did the same thing to Sergei Brylin.

“I would imagine it was pretty loud after Dubielewicz poke-checked Sergei,” Zach Parise, who scored for the Devils in the shootout, told The Post. “I’m sure it was pretty loud.”

Indeed, the video confirms his recollection.

“Those are the moments that makes our sport, in my opinion — being a little biased — the best sport out there,” Park said. “You just can’t predict, and as much as you want a storybook ending every time in your favor, things don’t [always] work out like that.”

Sixteen years later, though, the Islanders got their storybook ending again.

Regarding the injuries

Mathew Barzal (suspected knee) and Alexander Romanov (upper body) both skated on their own ahead of Wednesday’s game, with Romanov having first gotten on the ice Tuesday following his injury nearly two weeks ago in Tampa.

Lane Lambert and the Islanders have been tight-lipped about player injuries, and that isn’t likely to change as the postseason arrives. Corey Sipkin for the NY Post

The good news for the Islanders is that they now have at least four days between games, as the playoffs won’t start until Monday, with the potential for Game 1 of their series against the Bruins or Hurricanes to be Tuesday.

(On a scheduling note: The Boston Marathon is Monday. Whether that makes the Bruins more or less likely to be hosting a playoff game that night is up to your interpretation).

The Islanders have been extremely guarded about injuries and personnel decisions all year, and will only be more tight-lipped in the playoffs. Asked about Barzal’s availability for Game 1 on Wednesday night, Lambert said: “He’s still day to day, so we don’t know yet. We’ll know a little bit more as we go along.”

Translation: The Islanders are not about to publicly reveal anything here.

Five hits from Isles-Canadiens

• Eighty-one games of competition isn’t much, but Wednesday was, by a large margin, the best atmosphere in the short history of UBS Arena.

Alexander Romanov’s absence with an upper body injury suffered earlier this month has placed a strain on the Islanders’ defense. NHLI via Getty Images

• Something I’ve been wondering: If you gave the Islanders the choice between Barzal or Romanov returning for the playoffs, would they have to pick Romanov? The way his absence has unsettled the Isles in the defensive zone and destabilized them on the back end is stark. But then again, Barzal is Barzal, and his return is the power play’s best chance of regaining competency.

• If Barzal isn’t back for Game 1 of the playoffs, it probably will and should be Josh Bailey on Bo Horvat’s right side. Bailey’s game on Wednesday was not all too noticeable, but he’s played in the postseason before and knows how to play mistake-free hockey in these situations. Plus, his scoring output is 60 percent higher per 60 minutes than Simon Holmstrom’s in terms of total points.

• An up-and-down season for Noah Dobson was fairly well encapsulated on Wednesday. A defensive-zone giveaway along the wall led directly to Rem Pitlick’s goal late in the first. But by the end of the night, Dobson had a pair of assists.

• On a related note, it will be interesting to see how much Lambert rides Adam Pelech and Ryan Pulock in the playoffs, especially if Romanov is not yet back. Scott Mayfield led the Isles in ice time on Wednesday with 25:53, so Lambert does not seem to be quite there yet as far as using his top pair so much.",['Social Links For Ethan Sears'],2023-04-13 00:00:00
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/factbox-wall-st-banks-expect-130745939.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,Factbox-Wall St banks expect one more Fed rate-hike as recession looms,"(Reuters) - Most major U.S. banks expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by another 25 basis points next month, following evidence of sticky inflation and a strong labor market.

The Fed had pressed ahead with a hike in March as well, even though the U.S. banking crisis raised the specter of a recession as lending conditions tightened.

Money markets are currently pricing in a roughly 65% chance of a 25bps hike from the Fed in May. Such a hike will bring the Fed Funds rate increase for this cycle to 5%, taking the rate to the 5% to 5.25% range. Traders expect a pause thereafter and see rate cuts beginning in the second half of the year.

LOS ANGELES, April 12, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Building on the massive importance, impact, and universal popularity Latin music has in the U.S. and around the globe, (OVG), the global venue development, advisory, and investment company for the sports and live entertainment industries and SBS Entertainment, the entertainment division of Spanish Broadcasting System, Inc. the ""Company"" or ""SBS"") (OTC Pink: SBSAA) the leading Minority certified, Hispanic multimedia and entertainment company today announced a multi-year strategic agreement. The two innovative, growing companies will reimagine the live performance landscape by bringing together both a media entertainment company and a venue entertainment company to create new content and expand the presence of fan-favorite events to reach new mainstream audiences throughout North America.

Oak View Group and SBS Entertainment have announced a multi-year strategic agreement to reimagine live events.

SBS Entertainment is known for bringing to life some of the most iconic live Latin music experiences. Its line-up of live music events consists of experiences that have been around for decades, including the Crown Jewel of Live Latin Music events, Calibash, which has been historically sold-out since its inception. In recent years, the popularity of Latin music continues to surge. According to RIAA, Latin music revenue generated $552M on a retail basis in the US in 2019, $655M 2020, and growing to $886M in 2021. The 2021 total signifies roughly 35.3 percent year-over-year growth, against 23.4 percent year-over-year growth for the broader domestic music industry throughout the same period, outpacing overall recorded music revenues and reaching an all-time high in share.

As part of the deal, SBS's signature events including Mega Mezcla, Amor En Vivo, and Mega Bash, which all take place across key Hispanic markets, will also be produced at UBS Arena at Belmont Park, New York's entertainment and sports venue and home of the New York Islanders. UBS Arena's inaugural presentation of Mega Bash will take place December 2023. Additionally, the companies will team to present newly created events at OVG venues including Moody Center in Austin, TX; newly opened Acrisure Arena in Greater Palm Springs, CA; and in the Orlando, FL area. The program is expected to be expanded to additional participating OVG venues across North America and eventually Europe.

""As one of the largest concert producers in the nation and trailblazers for Latin music, it is our mission to continue to build upon our legacy by creating more unparalleled live music experiences for audiences across the globe,"" said Alessandra Alarcón, president, SBS Entertainment. ""Our partnership with the Oak View Group is the first of its kind and we couldn't be more excited to work with them to expand our footprint across their world-class venues and connect more Latin music fans with the artists they love.""

The demand for Latin music continues to grow and sold-out tours around the world have become a profitable expansion opportunity with a growing openness to new artists and music. Recognizing the overall demand for Latin music, the 2022 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival (commonly called Coachella) doubled the number of Latin performers from the 2020 roster with more than 20 multi-genre Latin artists. Latin acts accounted for 22 of the 200 biggest tours in the world in 2022.

""As the popularity and globalization of Latin music continues to rise, we're delighted to partner with SBS Entertainment to broaden its audience, while delivering greater diversity across our business, and bringing its iconic live events to OVG's roster of world-class arenas,"" said Francesca Bodie, president of business development, Oak View Group. ""This partnership represents a foundation that we plan to grow, both nationally and internationally in the coming years, and we look forward to developing more programming with Alessandra and the SBS team.""

Widely regarded in industry circles as a leader in the Latino multimedia sector, SBS is the largest certified minority-owned, Hispanic-targeted media company in the nation, operating top-rated radio formats in the country's largest markets, including flagship WSKQ-FM in New York City, America's most-listened-to station in any language (and the #1 Spanish-language station in the world); Aire, the most expansive Spanish-language radio network with 300+ affiliates; LaMusica, the country's highest-rated and fastest growing Hispanic streaming app; MegaTV, the popular news and political commentary television network; and concert promoter SBS Entertainment and its perennially sold-out roster of signature live events.

SBS Entertainment's pre-pandemic Calibash 2020 dominated Billboard magazine's Top U.S. Concert Promoter's List as one of the highest grossing events in the nation, alongside ticketed performances by Elton John, Madonna, and Celine Dion.

NEW YORK (AP) — Brock Nelson scored twice as the New York Islanders beat the Montreal Canadiens 4-2 Wednesday night and clinched a playoff berth.

The Islanders are awaiting the outcome of the Florida Panthers-Carolina Hurricanes game on Thursday to determine their first-round playoff opponent. New York missed the postseason last year, and that led to the firing of head coach Barry Trotz in May.

Hudson Fasching and Anders Lee also scored for New York, and Ilya Sorokin made 16 saves as the Islanders closed out their regular season. Noah Dobson added two assists.

Rem Pitlick and Nick Suzuki scored for Montreal, and Sam Montembeault finished with 31 saves in the Canadiens’ next-to-last game of the regular season.

Lee scored a power-play goal at 16:01 of the third period to give the Islanders 4-2 lead. The Islanders captain redirected a shot from Sebastian Aho for his 28th goal of the season.

Suzuki cut the Canadiens deficit in half with a crafty short-handed goal at 14:38 of the second period. Montreal’s captain beat Islanders defenseman Samuel Bolduc in a foot race and, with one hand, lifted the puck over the glove of Sorokin. Bolduc did not play another shift after te goal.

Nelson extended the Islanders’ lead to 3-1 with his second goal of the game midway through the second period. New York generated several scoring opportunities on an extended shift in the offensive zone, and Nelson eventually redirected Dobson’s shot at 10:20. Scott Mayfield also assisted on the play.

The Islanders outshot the Canadiens 19-6 in the middle period.

Nelson scored his team-leading 35th goal to open the scoring at 10:27 of the first period. The 31-year-old entered the offensive zone with possession of the puck and fired a wrist shot from the high slot past the glove of Montembault. Kyle Palmieri and Adam Pelech picked up assists.

Before the first goal of the game, Sorokin made a neat save with his right pad on Canadiens forward Denis Gurianov to keep the game scoreless.

Story continues

Fasching helped the Islanders regain a one-goal edge with a timely goal at 18:57 of the first. Jean-Gabriel Pageau set up Zach Parise for a deflection that rang off the crossbar and Fasching crashed the net and buried the rebound to give New York a 2-1 lead.

Pitlick blasted a one-timer to tie the game at 1 at 17:38 of the first period. Jake Evans stole the puck from Dobson and found Pitlick alone in the circle.

NOTES: Canadiens forward Joel Teasdale made his NHL debut. … Josh Bailey returned to the lineup after being a healthy scratch the previous three games. … Mathew Barzal and Alexander Romanov continue to skate on their own, but haven’t participated in a team practice as of yet. Barzal sustained a lower-body injury on Feb.18 against the Boston Bruins, and Romanov has been sidelined with an upper-body injury he suffered on Apr. 1 against the Tampa Bay Lightning.

BlackRock's Financial Markets Advisory group has been selling off securities over the last two weeks, including pieces of collateralized loan obligations, commercial mortgage bonds and niche asset-backed debt, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

BlackRock and Credit Suisse declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.

The move comes after the Swiss lender was acquired by UBS Group AG in a state-brokered deal.

Earlier this month, U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) retained BlackRock's unit to sell the securities portfolios it kept in receivership after the collapse of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank.

In March, law firm Pallas Partners told Reuters that they along with a Swiss council were working on possible legal action on behalf of some Credit Suisse AT1 bond investors whose holdings were wiped out following the bank's takeover.

https://news.yahoo.com/bank-england-considers-raising-saver-062918337.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,"Bank of England considers raising saver protection, governor says","Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told the IMF meeting he did not believe the world faced another financial crisis.

The Bank of England is considering raising the level of protection given to bank savings, following recent upheaval in the financial sector.

Currently, deposits up to £85,000 are protected if a bank fails, far less than in US banks.

Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said he did not believe there was a risk of a 2008-style crisis.

But he questioned whether UK banks were holding enough liquidity - or available cash - to cope with short-term shocks.

Rules on how much money banks hold in case of trouble were being reviewed, as well as the bank deposit insurance scheme, he said.

Speaking at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting in Washington, Mr Bailey said reforms put in place after the 2008 financial crisis had been effective during the recent turmoil, which saw rising concern over the health of the global financial system and a slide in bank shares around the world.

""The post-crisis reforms to bank regulation have worked,"" Mr Bailey said.

""Today I do not believe we face a systemic banking crisis. When I look at the UK banks, they are well capitalised, liquid and able to serve their customers and support the economy.""

The trouble was triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and two other US lenders. Shortly after, Switzerland's UBS was forced to buy rival Credit Suisse.

Regulators are now focusing on whether banks need bigger cash buffers, given new challenges. In particular, the spread of news on social media and electronic banking mean that savers can move their money out of financial institutions within seconds, making them more vulnerable to sudden bank runs.

Mr Bailey said regulators shouldn't assume that current levels of liquidity protection were ""correct"".

""Runs can go further much more quickly,"" he said.

When SVB ran into difficulty, $40bn was withdrawn from the bank in 24 hours amid social media rumours, as savers were able to instantly take out their savings digitally.

Story continues

The chair of the US Federal Reserve called it the fastest bank run in American history and the authorities stepped in to protect all deposits.

Standard deposit protection is already significantly higher in the US at $250,000 (£200,000).

Both the US and the EU, where deposits are protected to a comparable size as in the UK, are considering raising their levels of protection. But such moves would come at a cost to big banks, and could potentially limit flows of credit.

Protection for bank deposits, administered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, was increased substantially following the 2008 financial crisis. Before that savers were covered for less than £32,000 per institution.

For most individuals, there is little chance of ever having £85,000 in a bank account.

However, whenever there are wobbles in the banking sector, the safety of savings is of immediate concern to many, particularly older savers, with savings held to recover retirement - hence the wider reassurance provided by the safety net.

There is extra protection available for people who have a sudden influx of funds, due to a life event such as a divorce settlement, inheritance or payout from a life insurance policy. The ""Temporary High Balance"" protection covers deposits over £85,000 and up to £1m per institution for up to six months.","['Faisal Islam', 'Peter Hoskins - Bbc News']",

https://www.amny.com/sports/islanders-canadiens-4-12-23/,"Islanders do just enough, defeat Canadiens 4-2 to clinch playoff berth","ELMONT, N.Y. — The seemingly never-ending game of hot potato between the New York Islanders and Pittsburgh Penguins passing up golden opportunities to lock up the final Eastern Conference playoff spot is over — and it’s the Islanders who have snuck their way in.

For the fourth time in five years, the Islanders will contend for the Stanley Cup after squeaking by the lowly Montreal Canadiens 4-2 in their 2022-23 regular-season finale on Wednesday night at UBS Arena behind two goals from Brock Nelson including the game-winner in the second period, 19 saves from Ilya Sorokin, and just enough gumption to overcome the glaring issues that have plagued them for most of the season.

“Obviously different emotions compared to yesterday after the Washington game, but we had a chance at home and wanted to take advantage of it,” Nelson said after his side got a huge helper from the Chicago Blackhawks, who defeated the Penguins on Tuesday night to keep the Islanders’ playoff hopes alive following a disheartening loss to the Washington Capitals. “I thought we did everything we needed to.”

The Islanders’ (42-31-9, 93 points) first-round opponent is still unknown for now. Their final seeding hinges on the result of the Florida Panthers’ final game of the regular season on Thursday night against the Carolina Hurricanes. If the Panthers, who have 92 points, defeat the Carolina Hurricanes, they get the No. 1 Wild Card spot which would relegate the Islanders to playing the powerhouse Boston Bruins.

Should the Panthers lose, the Islanders will take on the winner of the Metropolitan Division — either the Hurricanes or New Jersey Devils.

“It’s a sigh of relief,” defenseman Noah Dobson, who tallied a pair of assists, said. “It just shows how tough this league is to get into the playoffs. It takes all 82 games to grind but I thought… we dug in deep and we deserve to be in.”

Nelson got the Islanders on the board — and tested the integrity of UBS Arean’s roof — 10:27 into the game when he sniped his 35th goal of the season over the blocker side of Canadiens goalie Sam Montembeault.

The goal put the All-Star center in rarified Islanders air, becoming just the 11th skater in franchise history to record multiple 35-plus-goal seasons (he scored 37 last year).

“Our line did some good things to generate,” Nelson said of his budding partnership with Kyle Palmieri and Pierre Engvall. “We’ve done that for a few weeks… Knowing what was at stake, I think everyone tried to get up as much as you can.”

But that first goal seemed to supply an air of complacency as the Islanders stopped pushing and lost focus.

Noah Dobson turned the puck over on the right boards of his own zone, allowing Jake Evans to find a wide-open Rem Pitlick just above the left goal line for a one-time finish into an open net with 2:22 to go in the first as Sorokin — who made his fair share of vital saves amidst the momentary swoon in the second half of the period — didn’t have a chance.

Montreal’s opener jolted the Islanders back into alignment as they found a reply just 1:19 later when Hudson Fasching — who burst onto the scene out of nowhere to be one of the team’s most valuable players of the season — stuffed home a loose puck that laid at the feet of a sprawled-out Montemault after a Zach Parise tip rang off the crossbar.

“You get a real feel for a player and we continue to see him doing things that we like,” head coach Lane Lambert said about Fasching. “When I talk about contributions from everyone to be in this position right now, he is certainly one of those guys.”

Nelson got his second 10:20 into the second to put the hosts up two with a deft deflection while stationed between the circles. A shot from Dobson at the point was directed downward by Wednesday night’s hero and it bounced under Montembeault and into the back of the net.

“He’s been great,” Islanders captain Anders Lee said of Nelson. “He’s had a phenomenal season and we’ve leaned on him for big moments and goals for many years, not just this year.”

In theory, the Islanders had a chance to build their advantage on a power play after Brendan Gallagher tripped Fasching. But New York’s inept man-advantage unit came up lame as Montreal’s Nick Suzuki out-raced Samuel Bolduc to a rolling puck in front of Sorokin’s goal off a clear and, while sliding, chipped it with one hand over the netminder for a highlight-worthy short-handed goal with 3:22 to go in the period.

Bolduc was benched for the rest of the game after that play.

“He could have maintained body position on Suzuki,” Lambert said. “That’s a young player learning and growing and he’ll learn from those situations.”

The final 20 minutes saw the Islanders revert to their defensive game, yielding just five Canadiens shots in the third period to secure the win, but Anders Lee provided the exclamation point with a deflected power-play goal to end their lengthy nine-game man-advantage drought with 3:59 to go in regulation.

“It was textbook,” Dobson said of the Islanders’ defensive efforts. “When we’re locking it down like that, it’s hard to get through and hard to play against.”

SBPV managing director Natalia Ferrara has written to lawmakers to demand they consider staff affected by the collapse of Credit Suisse and halt any job losses until the end of 2023.

""We ... call on you to support our demand for a freeze on layoffs by the end of 2023 in parliament,"" Ferrara wrote in the letter published by newspaper Blick on Monday.

""Politicians must not shirk responsibility,"" she added.

The Swiss parliament is due to meet in extraordinary session on Tuesday to discuss the state-sponsored rescue of Credit Suisse which took place last month.

UBS agreed to buy Zurich rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.31 billion) in a deal engineered by the government, the central bank and market regulator to avoid a meltdown in the country's financial system.

""For the past three weeks, many of the approximately 17,000 employees at Credit Suisse and the 22,000 UBS employees have been looking at their future with uncertainty,"" said Ferrara, referring to the staff numbers in Switzerland.

Credit Suisse employs 45,000 people globally, while UBS has 74,000 in total.

""In the public debate about the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, there is a lot of talk about numbers, money, regulation, 'too big to fail' or bonuses,"" Ferrara wrote.

""But the affected employees of the two banks remain only a side note.

""That needs to change.""

UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti last week warned there would be ""change and hard decisions"" ahead following the takeover.

The giant bank created could reduce its workforce by 20%-30%, it has been reported by Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger, with 11,000 jobs being cut in Switzerland.

UBS has said it is too early to speculate on job cuts.

Ferrara said it was not the fault of the bank employees that the rescue was required, adding it would take months for UBS's plans to be worked out.

""Now it is time for the affected employees of the two banks to be given protection and respect,"" Ferrara wrote.

""It must not be the case that parliament debates money and technical aspects of the CS rescue for days during the extraordinary session and the people affected are forgotten."" ($1 = 0.9069 Swiss francs)",[],2023-04-11 00:00:00
https://www.columbian.com/news/2023/apr/12/credit-suisse-rescue-rebuked-by-half-of-swiss-parliament/,Credit Suisse rescue rebuked by half of Swiss parliament,"GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland’s lower house of parliament issued a searing — though symbolic — rebuke Wednesday of an emergency plan spearheaded by the executive branch to prop up embattled Credit Suisse and shepherd it into a takeover by Swiss banking rival UBS.

The National Council, through an unusual left-right alliance, voted twice over the last day to reject government guarantees authorized last month of 100 billion Swiss francs (about $110 billion) to help keep Credit Suisse afloat and 9 billion francs to help UBS mop up any losses it may incur in the deal.

The votes took place in a special parliamentary session that wrapped up Wednesday to scrutinize long-running troubles at Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old bank that was a pillar of Swiss finance, and the government plan to save it from a collapse that could have shaken the global financial system.

Switzerland’s main right-wing party opposed tighter regulations on banks, while centrists favored tougher rules but would accept state help for banks in some cases. Left-leaning parties that have long decried “overly dangerous” banks were insistent on stricter limits on bonuses for top executives and requirements for more money to be kept on hand by the biggest lenders.

“The whole discussion centered on whether more regulation was needed — in particular to the leverage ratio — and severely regulate bonuses of the managers of the big, systemically important banks,” Socialist lawmaker Roger Nordmann said.","['Jamey Keaten', 'Associated Press']",2023-04-12 00:00:00

Wholesale prices declined 0.5 percent in March, according to US data, with the drop largely attributed to a fall in energy prices.

The report came on the heels of US government data Wednesday that showed a generally improving picture on consumer prices, although inflation remained elevated when food and energy costs were stripped out.

""Inflation is on a slowing trend,"" said LBBW's Karl Haeling. ""There's definitely an optimism that the end is near in terms of the Fed's cycle of interest rate increases.""

All three major US stock indices advanced, led by the Nasdaq, which packed on two percent following a rally in Apple, Netflix and other big-name tech companies.

In Europe, Paris led its counterparts, jumping 1.1 percent after luxury giant LVMH reported bumper first-quarter sales. It helped drive the CAC 40 to a fresh record-high for the third session in a row.

London stocks closed 0.2 percent higher as data showed the UK economy unexpectedly stalled in February.

But the dollar fell to a one-year low against the euro as traders bet on a pivot in Fed policy in the foreseeable future.

- 'Wishful thinking' -

""There is certainly some optimism that prices are heading in the right direction and that inflation is slowing,"" Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said.

""However, there is also plenty of room for wishful thinking as markets continue to price in the prospect of rate cuts by year-end.""

Investors now have their eyes trained on crucial first-quarter earnings on Friday from top banks including JPMorgan and Citibank following last month's upheaval in the financial sector, which led to the emergency sale of troubled Credit Suisse to Swiss rival UBS.

""For weeks it's all about the trajectory of inflation and subsequent interest rate hikes for investors,"" noted Nigel Green, head of financial consultancy deVere Group.

""But the focus is now shifting to earnings season,"" Green said.

""The big banks will be keenly watched as not only do they often set the mood music for the rest of the season, but also because they are more intricately linked to the rest of the economy than most other sectors,"" Green added.

Asian markets ended mixed after a downbeat start.

Hong Kong edged up despite sharp losses in the tech sector that came after the Financial Times reported that Japan's SoftBank was looking to unload a majority of its holdings in Alibaba.

Up to 70,000 stores may shut down if retail sales growth does not reach the yearly average

More than 1,400 retail stores under major retailers are shutting down this year

A combination of rising operational costs and the rallying of e-commerce sales are expected to deal a huge blow to the U.S. retail market, resulting in the likely closure of more than 50,000 retail stores across the country within the next five years, a new study by investment bank and financial services company UBS has reportedly suggested.

UBS equity research analyst Michael Lasser and his team predicted in the study, which was released Tuesday, that more than 50,000 retail stores will likely shut down in the U.S. due to rising operational costs and the ramping up of e-commerce sales in businesses, Insider reported. The team further predicted that the steepest declines will be felt the most by specialty retailers, specifically those in consumer electronics and clothing stores.

Some 4,000 home furnishing stores out of 47,769 shops in the U.S. are expected to shut down within the next five years. Apparel and accessories stores are poised to see a bigger decline as UBS expects a minimum of 14,000 shops under the said subsector to close by 2027.

UBS said the number of expected retail store closures represents a reduction of 5% in the overall U.S. retail store count of about 940,000 shops. Smaller retail chains are expected to be affected by the physical store decline while big retailers such as Target, Costco and Walmart are predicted to see big wins over the said period.

https://t.co/UTiYwdUrLt pic.twitter.com/8zJ7j5za7P — Streetinsider.com (@Street_Insider) April 11, 2023

Unlike smaller retailers, retail giants have more business backbone to absorb the impact of rising costs and have more means to invest in strategies that will cater to the shifting demand in digital sales.

Regional retail chains, especially those located within shopping malls, are expected to ""continue closing stores and potentially go out of business,"" UBS analysts said, as per Sourcing Journal.

Finally, UBS analysts warned that if retail sales growth falls short of the 4% per year average, store closures in the sector could reach beyond 70,000 as e-commerce sales are expected to see a 26% hike in total sales by 2028.

Last month, retail executives had less-than-stellar projections about consumer spending even as retail companies reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings.

Some retail executives said they expected ""headwinds"" in the market and ""softness"" in consumer spending, The Buffalo News reported. Furthermore, they told investors and analysts that earnings for the first quarter of 2023 and possibly throughout the year would be smaller than in previous years.

Many of the retail executives who had downbeat outlooks of the retail market for this year cited shifting patterns among low-income shoppers who continue to suffer from inflation and the economic downturn.

""The lower-household-income customers are pinched,"" Bruce K. Thorn, CEO of furniture retailer Big Lots, said, according to the outlet.

In February, U.S. retail sales fell moderately at 0.4%, as reported by the Commerce Department. In the previous month, retail sales climbed 3.2%, with economists pointing out that challenges with adjusting data for shifting spending patterns at the end and the start of the year affected the ""exaggerated"" surge in January retail sales growth.

During February's sales decline, motor vehicle purchases led the pack in the contraction as auto dealers' receipts were down by 1.8%. Furniture stores and clothing retailers also saw a decline, while online sales increased by 1.6%.

More than a dozen major retailers have announced store closures in the U.S. this year, Insider earlier reported. The collective number of store closures announced so far in 2023 from the likes of Amazon, Foot Locker and Walmart is 1,416.

While some of the companies that have so far announced store closures this year pointed to cost-cutting measures as a reason for the shutdowns, others said they were adjusting selling methods to meet ever-changing purchasing trends.

Foot Locker leads the list of retailers that announced store closures this year, saying it will close 545 stores by 2026. Bed Bath & Beyond will close 416 locations this year, Tuesday Morning will shutter 265 stores amid bankruptcy proceedings, Bath & Body Works will close about 50 mall-based stores and Gap and Banana will shut down 46 stores. Other retailers on the list announced the closure of less than 30 physical stores.

In April last year, UBS said traditional shopping malls were at higher risk of seeing retail store closures than strip centers due largely to a decrease in shopper mall traffic as consumers shifted to shopping in stores closer to their own homes.",['Marvie Basilan'],2023-04-12 06:30:01-04:00

The Islanders were coming to the end of the first period night and the air had briefly left UBS Arena.

Just over a minute earlier, the Canadiens had tied the score in a game the Islanders had to win to clinch a playoff berth without help.

The puck fell to Fasching after Zach Parise’s shot, and the 27-year-old Minnesotan took a whack at it.

That whack gave the Islanders the lead and they did not relinquish it in a 4-2 victory that secured a Stanley Cup playoff spot.

“Pretty surreal,” Fasching told The Post in the postgame locker room. “Hard to believe. I’m obviously ecstatic. It’s a dream come true.

“It’s something every kid imagines, playing in the Stanley Cup playoffs. Absolutely excited, thrilled.”

Hudson Fasching is all smiles after scoring a first-period goal during the Islanders’ 4-2 playoff-clinching win over Canadiens. AP

Much as Fasching might have imagined such a moment as a child, he would have given you a more realistic assessment eight months ago, when the Islanders signed him to a two-way deal after his eight years with the Buffalo and Arizona organizations had yielded just 38 NHL games, one NHL goal and a lot of AHL bus rides.

“I wouldn’t [have] believed you, probably, I guess? Obviously you gotta believe in yourself,” Fasching said, “but to some extent, it’s hard to believe. I’m just really happy to be here, grateful for us.”

Fasching’s goal on Wednesday was his 10th of the season, as he continued to play a vital role on the third line. Thrust into the lineup in December amid a slew of injuries, Fasching never left — and as a pending free agent this summer, he is suddenly a priority.

“Obviously,” Fasching said prior to the game, “I’d like to stay here.”

The Islanders should like to keep him.

Anders Lee, who had met Fasching during occasional summer skates back in their home state of Minnesota prior to the season, understands the grind well as a former sixth-round pick who made it. These moments don’t come often. Fasching seized his.

“This game is, at times, very unforgiving,” Lee said. “But he’s had an opportunity this year and you have to take advantage of it.

“This league is extremely tough. You kinda have to have results or make an impact every night. There’s no question he’s done that and more. So I’m extremely proud of him.”

Fasching doesn’t use the word “proud” much, though he surely does feel some pride in this most unlikely achievement. He usually opts for “grateful” — and gratitude did emanate from him Wednesday night.

“I think staying in the NHL is coming to some sort of a stable position,” he said, “but playoffs is a whole other element and something I’m excited to tackle. But yeah, it’s pretty crazy.”",['Social Links For Ethan Sears'],2023-04-13 00:00:00
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-sells-asset-backed-bonds-203339276.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,BlackRock Sells Asset-Backed Bonds From Credit Suisse’s Books,"(Bloomberg) -- Credit Suisse Group AG has hired BlackRock Inc. to help sell a portfolio of structured bonds for the Swiss bank, becoming the latest entity to tap the money manager in a time of crisis.

Most Read from Bloomberg

BlackRock’s Financial Markets Advisory group has been selling off securities over the last two weeks, including pieces of collateralized loan obligations, commercial mortgage bonds and niche asset backed debt, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Bonds backed by auto, credit card, student and aircraft loans or leases were also included in the lists of securities put up for sale, which included at least $300 million of bonds, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private transactions.

Representatives for BlackRock and Credit Suisse declined to comment.

The sales come weeks after Credit Suisse was sold to UBS Group AG in a state-brokered deal, and just a few months after the Swiss bank’s structured team moved over to a new company called Atlas SP Partners, which is backed by Apollo Global Management Inc. The merger will see large parts of Credit Suisse’s investment bank wound down in what UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher called a bigger deal to manage than even those during the height of the 2008 financial crisis.

This is BlackRock’s second sale process this month in structured bonds, with its Financial Markets Advisory group having also been tapped by the US government to help sell $114 billion of securities amassed from failed lenders Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank. Those include agency mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and CMBS. BlackRock has been charged with selling those assets for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which said the firm would seek a “gradual and orderly” process.

Story continues

The move follows Credit Suisse’s announcement of a “new strategy and transformation plan” in late October, which included job cuts as well as “significant exposure reduction” to securitized products, such as collateralized loan obligations.

The $8.6 trillion asset manager has a history of swooping in to sell old inventory in troubled times. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve and US Department of the Treasury awarded contracts to BlackRock to manage $130 billion of bad debt formerly on the books of Bear Stearns and American International Group Inc. The Fed also turned to BlackRock to help oversee debt-buying programs to help stabilize the economy at the onset of the pandemic in 2020.

NEW YORK -- Keith Yandle walked into coffee shops when he played hockey in New York and would hear people talking about the next Rangers game against the Islanders or the New Jersey Devils.

""When you play those teams, even during the regular season, it adds a little bit more,"" Yandle said. ""Those are fun rivalries.""

Take those rivalries and add the prospect of elimination. The results could mean a spring sports scene in the Big Apple area that hasn't happened in almost three decades.

All three New York-area teams are in the NHL playoffs this year - just the fourth time that has happened and the first since 2007. Add in the NBA's Knicks and Brooklyn Nets and it's the first time the city's five indoor major professional teams all qualified for the postseason since 1994, when the Rangers lifted the Stanley Cup.

The Devils and Rangers could face off in the playoffs for the first time since the 2012 Eastern Conference final. And given the teams' young talent and potential, it's easy to envision a championship parade coming to New York or North Jersey in the not-too-distant future.

""It's awesome for the sport,"" said Brian Boyle, who played for the Rangers and Devils before retiring and joining NHL Network. ""The passion, that's what drives it. That's what makes sports great, and they have that right there. And when they're all doing fairly well - there's no doormats now - it's exciting.""

Much like Major League Baseball's Subway Series between the Yankees and Mets, the mix of contending hockey teams in New York makes for interesting tension in the stands and in local establishments showing the games on TV.

""You're cheering against your neighbors, your cousins, your family,"" said Islanders forward Kyle Palmieri, who also played for the Devils after growing up in New Jersey. ""Everyone kind of has their own alliances.""

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-suisse-job-cuts-must-064221799.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,"Credit Suisse job cuts must be frozen, Swiss banks' employees leader says","ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse and UBS must freeze any job cuts planned as part of their emergency merger, the Swiss Bank Employees' Association (SBPV) said on Tuesday, in an open letter to the country's parliament.

SBPV managing director Natalia Ferrara has written to lawmakers to demand they consider staff affected by the collapse of Credit Suisse and halt any job losses until the end of 2023.

""We ... call on you to support our demand for a freeze on layoffs by the end of 2023 in parliament,"" Ferrara wrote in the letter seen by Reuters.

""Politicians must not shirk their responsibility,"" she added.

The Swiss parliament is due to meet in extraordinary session on Tuesday to discuss the state-sponsored rescue of Credit Suisse which took place last month.

UBS agreed to buy Zurich rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.31 billion) in a deal engineered by the government, the central bank and market regulator to avoid a meltdown in the country's financial system.

""For the past three weeks, many of the approximately 17,000 employees at Credit Suisse and the 22,000 UBS employees have been looking at their future with uncertainty,"" said Ferrara, referring to the staff numbers in Switzerland.

Credit Suisse employs 45,000 people globally, while UBS has 74,000 in total.

""In the public debate about the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, there is a lot of talk about numbers, money, regulation, 'too big to fail' or bonuses,"" wrote Ferrara, whose organisation represents 6,000 workers in Switzerland.

""But the affected employees of the two banks remain only a side note. That needs to change.""

UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti last week warned there would be ""change and hard decisions"" ahead following the takeover.

The giant bank created could reduce its workforce by 20%-30%, it has been reported by Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger, with 11,000 jobs being cut in Switzerland.

Story continues

UBS has said it is too early to speculate on job cuts.

Ferrara said it was not the fault of the bank employees that the rescue was required, adding it would take months for UBS's plans to be worked out.

""Now it is time for the affected employees of the two banks to be given protection and respect,"" Ferrara wrote in the letter that was first published by Swiss newspaper Blick on Tuesday.

""It must not be the case that parliament debates money and technical aspects of the CS rescue for days during the extraordinary session and the people affected are forgotten.""

Keith Yandle walked into coffee shops when he played hockey in New York and would hear people talking about the next Rangers game against the Islanders or the New Jersey Devils. “When you play those teams, even during the regular season, it adds a little bit more,” Yandle said. “Those are fun rivalries.”

Take those rivalries and add the prospect of elimination. The results could mean a spring sports scene in the Big Apple area that hasn’t happened in almost three decades.

All three New York-area teams are in the NHL playoffs this year — just the fourth time that has happened and the first since 2007. Add in the NBA’s Knicks and Brooklyn Nets and it’s the first time the city’s five indoor major professional teams all qualified for the postseason since 1994, when the Rangers lifted the Stanley Cup.

The Devils and Rangers could face off in the playoffs for the first time since the 2012 Eastern Conference final. And given the teams’ young talent and potential, it’s easy to envision a championship parade coming to New York or North Jersey in the not-too-distant future.

“It’s awesome for the sport,” said Brian Boyle, who played for the Rangers and Devils before retiring and joining NHL Network. “The passion, that’s what drives it. That’s what makes sports great, and they have that right there. And when they’re all doing fairly well — there’s no doormats now — it’s exciting.”

Much like Major League Baseball’s Subway Series between the Yankees and Mets, the mix of contending hockey teams in New York makes for interesting tension in the stands and in local establishments showing the games on TV.

“You’re cheering against your neighbors, your cousins, your family,” said Islanders forward Kyle Palmieri, who also played for the Devils after growing up in New Jersey. “Everyone kind of has their own alliances.”

https://fortune.com/2023/04/13/warren-buffett-failed-bank-ceos-penalized-return-pension-salaries/,Warren Buffett: Failed bank CEOs should live modestly,"Berkshire Hathaway boss Warren Buffett doesn’t mind upsetting his friends.

Despite the billionaire rubbing shoulders with the Wall Street elite for decades, Buffett has called for harsher penalties on CEOs, presidents, and directors of failed banks.

His call comes after a slew of problems in the sector in recent months, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and later Signature Bank being shut down by the New York State Department of Financial Services.

Credit Suisse suffered a wobble before a $3.2 billion rescue deal was agreed on with UBS—a process that left certain types of bond holders out in the cold and required billions of francs of Swiss taxpayer money to be used as a guarantee to stabilize the market.

In the future, Coca-Cola investor Buffett wants to see CEOs of busted banks held accountable—namely by forcing them to give back the pension they accrued during the time they were in the post.

Buffett believes not only that CEOs should be forced to return retirement savings if they “screw up,” but that directors should also be made to hand back five years worth of their lucrative salaries if they lead a bank to its demise.

“All kinds of trouble [was] caused by the banks. But bank executives…they all continue to live fine. They may have lost their job, but they got their pensions,” Buffett told CNBC’s Squawk Box. “There have got to be consequences to the people who make the decisions. Penalizing the shareholders later on by billions of dollars worth of fines…that doesn’t deter the bad action.”

The man worth $111 billion believes CEOs should “go back to living like a person that works on the production line of Ford or something like that. They don’t deserve anything special.”

Opulent banker lifestyles

Buffett’s opinion may be influenced by the likes of former SVB CEO Greg Becker, who just days after presiding over the second biggest bank failure in U.S. history, jetted off to his $3.1 million holiday home in Hawaii.

Becker had been partially blamed—by staff at least—for the collapse of the San Francisco–based lender, after he candidly revealed the state of the business’ finances to investors in a move dubbed “idiotic” by employees.

Buffett believes his ideal system wouldn’t get rid of moral hazard “because it penalizes different people who make the decision,” he added. “And I wanna penalize people who make the decision and have it very clear to them.”

Will bank CEOs be punished?

Buffett added he believes it’s unlikely his idea would ever come into fruition, which would be good news for his friends who, he believes, will not greet his proposal with “great enthusiasm.”

While such a move could hit his popularity in the finance world, Buffett believes such action is necessary to deter similar behavior in the future.

“I’ve been on the board of banks, and the answer is to have board of directors feel like, ‘God, if this guy screws things up, I’ve gotta give back all this money that I’ve gotten, you know, $300,000 a year or whatever it may be in pre-stock,'” the 92-year-old Buffett explained. “Believe me, that changes behavior of the people that cause the problem.”

Buffett admitted bankers involved in the recent turmoil had not made the same mistakes as those who prompted the financial crisis of 2008—adding that the “reprehensible” individuals who presided over the chaos nearly 15 years ago got off relatively easy.

“I don’t know anybody that went back to flipping burgers at McDonald’s or something, after they screwed up the system in a big way in 2008 and ’09,” he said. “There’s no penalty attached to bad behavior. And it does really, really affect the system when people lose confidence in banks.

“I just think the system isn’t set up quite right in terms of connecting punishment to culprits on something that’s…incredibly important that your banking system run well in a country.”

Despite selling off a raft of shares in lenders, Berkshire Hathaway has kept hold of Bank of America stock, with Buffett heaping praise on its CEO Brian Moynihan as someone he likes “enormously.”

Such individuals will have to play a key part in restoring the public’s confidence in the sector, which Buffett—who is in Japan this week—believes is paramount: “It’s important the banks retain the confidence of the public and they can lose it in seconds.”",['Eleanor Pringle'],2023-04-13 00:00:00

https://www.nhl.com/canadiens/news/pregame-bruins-canadiens-what-you-need-to-know/c-343449208,BOS@MTL: What you need to know,"Here's everything you need to know heading into the game:

1. The Canadiens are back home after a quick hop over to Long Island on Wednesday night, where they fell 4-2 to the Islanders at UBS Arena. Forwards Nick Suzuki - with a beautiful shorthanded goal - and Rem Pitlick found twine to keep Montreal in the game, but New York managed to come out on top. Goaltender Sam Montembeault made 31 saves in the Habs' crease. The Islanders' victory over Montreal booked them a ticket to the playoffs, which will be held for the very first time at UBS Arena.

Video: MTL Recap: Suzuki records a goal each in a 4-2 loss

2. Recalled from the Rocket on Tuesday, forward Joel Teasdale and defenseman Frederic Allard were inserted into the lineup for the Islanders game. In fact, it was Teasdale's NHL debut and it was hard for the young winger to hide his excitement for the big moment.

Tweet from @CanadiensMTL: C'pas f��chant tout ��a 😄A million dollar smile#GoHabsGo pic.twitter.com/mEGbxfidPX

Teasdale played on the fourth line to the right of Michael Pezzetta and Chris Tierney, while Allard formed a pairing with Johnathan Kovacevic on the backend.

With Thursday's contest being the second of a back-to-back, the Canadiens won't hold a morning skate prior to the game. Any lineup changes will likely be known during St-Louis' pregame presser closer to puck drop, although he did confirm that Montembeault would get the start against Boston.

Tweet from @CanadiensMTL: Martin St-Louis confirme que Samuel Montembeault obtiendra le d��part devant le filet mercredi et jeudi soir.Head coach Martin St-Louis confirmed Samuel Montembeault will start in goal on Wednesday and Thursday night.#GoHabsGo

3. The Bruins are putting a cap on an historic season. On Thursday in Montreal, they'll be looking to beat their own NHL record of 64 wins and 133 points set on Tuesday against the Washington Capitals. Boston has yet to lose a game in April, with its last loss coming on March 28 against the Nashville Predators. The B's will be without some of their key players for the season finale, however. Goaltender Linus Ullmark left the Caps game as a precaution due to ""muscle tightening"" and did not travel to Montreal; head coach Jim Montgomery said he was leaning towards starting Jeremy Swayman against the Habs. Forward David Krejci, who hasn't played since April 1 against Pittsburgh, also did not make the trip. Both Derek Forbort and Nick Foligno are making progress towards a return, but won't play at the Bell Centre, while Tomas Nosek was questionable due to an illness.

4. The season finale is always a special night at the Bell Centre, as it's the culmination of Fan Appreciation Week. Doors open to both M2 Marche Montreal and the VIP CIBC entrance starting at 5:00 p.m. for the final ""5 à 6"" of the season. Thanks to our sponsors, a large number of prizes will be handed out to spectators in the building, and the night will close out with the return of the Jerseys Off Our Backs tradition, presented by RBC, where a select few lucky fans will get to receive a jersey directly off the back of a player. For those fans who won't be in attendance, don't forget to check out the final online Fan Appreciation Week contests from Club 1909.

5. Game time is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. ET. You can catch all the action on TSN2 and RDS on television, or listen in on TSN 690 and 98,5 fm on the radio. Enjoy the game! Bon match!",[],

LOS ANGELES, April 12, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Building on the massive importance, impact, and universal popularity Latin music has in the U.S. and around the globe, Oak View Group (OVG), the global venue development, advisory, and investment company for the sports and live entertainment industries and SBS Entertainment, the entertainment division of Spanish Broadcasting System, Inc. the ""Company"" or ""SBS"") SBSAA the leading Minority certified, Hispanic multimedia and entertainment company today announced a multi-year strategic agreement. The two innovative, growing companies will reimagine the live performance landscape by bringing together both a media entertainment company and a venue entertainment company to create new content and expand the presence of fan-favorite events to reach new mainstream audiences throughout North America.

Oak View Group and SBS Entertainment have announced a multi-year strategic agreement to reimagine live events.

SBS Entertainment is known for bringing to life some of the most iconic live Latin music experiences. Its line-up of live music events consists of experiences that have been around for decades, including the Crown Jewel of Live Latin Music events, Calibash, which has been historically sold-out since its inception. In recent years, the popularity of Latin music continues to surge. According to RIAA, Latin music revenue generated $552M on a retail basis in the US in 2019, $655M 2020, and growing to $886M in 2021. The 2021 total signifies roughly 35.3 percent year-over-year growth, against 23.4 percent year-over-year growth for the broader domestic music industry throughout the same period, outpacing overall recorded music revenues and reaching an all-time high in share.

As part of the deal, SBS's signature events including Mega Mezcla, Amor En Vivo, and Mega Bash, which all take place across key Hispanic markets, will also be produced at UBS Arena at Belmont Park, New York's entertainment and sports venue and home of the New York Islanders. UBS Arena's inaugural presentation of Mega Bash will take place December 2023. Additionally, the companies will team to present newly created events at OVG venues including Moody Center in Austin, TX; newly opened Acrisure Arena in Greater Palm Springs, CA; and in the Orlando, FL area. The program is expected to be expanded to additional participating OVG venues across North America and eventually Europe.

""As one of the largest concert producers in the nation and trailblazers for Latin music, it is our mission to continue to build upon our legacy by creating more unparalleled live music experiences for audiences across the globe,"" said Alessandra Alarcón, president, SBS Entertainment. ""Our partnership with the Oak View Group is the first of its kind and we couldn't be more excited to work with them to expand our footprint across their world-class venues and connect more Latin music fans with the artists they love.""

The demand for Latin music continues to grow and sold-out tours around the world have become a profitable expansion opportunity with a growing openness to new artists and music. Recognizing the overall demand for Latin music, the 2022 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival (commonly called Coachella) doubled the number of Latin performers from the 2020 roster with more than 20 multi-genre Latin artists. Latin acts accounted for 22 of the 200 biggest tours in the world in 2022.

""As the popularity and globalization of Latin music continues to rise, we're delighted to partner with SBS Entertainment to broaden its audience, while delivering greater diversity across our business, and bringing its iconic live events to OVG's roster of world-class arenas,"" said Francesca Bodie, president of business development, Oak View Group. ""This partnership represents a foundation that we plan to grow, both nationally and internationally in the coming years, and we look forward to developing more programming with Alessandra and the SBS team.""

Widely regarded in industry circles as a leader in the Latino multimedia sector, SBS is the largest certified minority-owned, Hispanic-targeted media company in the nation, operating top-rated radio formats in the country's largest markets, including flagship WSKQ-FM in New York City, America's most-listened-to station in any language (and the #1 Spanish-language station in the world); Aire, the most expansive Spanish-language radio network with 300+ affiliates; LaMusica, the country's highest-rated and fastest growing Hispanic streaming app; MegaTV, the popular news and political commentary television network; and concert promoter SBS Entertainment and its perennially sold-out roster of signature live events.

SBS Entertainment's pre-pandemic Calibash 2020 dominated Billboard magazine's Top U.S. Concert Promoter's List as one of the highest grossing events in the nation, alongside ticketed performances by Elton John, Madonna, and Celine Dion.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/factbox-wall-st-banks-expect-130745033.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,Factbox-Wall St banks expect one more Fed rate-hike as recession looms,"(Reuters) - Most major U.S. banks expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by another 25 basis points next month, following evidence of sticky inflation and a strong labor market.

The Fed had pressed ahead with a hike in March as well, even though the U.S. banking crisis raised the specter of a recession as lending conditions tightened.

Money markets are currently pricing in a roughly 65% chance of a 25bps hike from the Fed in May. Such a hike will bring the Fed Funds rate increase for this cycle to 5%, taking the rate to the 5% to 5.25% range. Traders expect a pause thereafter and see rate cuts beginning in the second half of the year.

The 2021 total signifies roughly 35.3 percent year-over-year growth, against 23.4 percent year-over-year growth for the broader domestic music industry throughout the same period, outpacing overall recorded music revenues and reaching an all-time high in share.

As part of the deal, SBS's signature events including Mega Mezcla, Amor En Vivo, and Mega Bash, which all take place across key Hispanic markets, will also be produced at UBS Arena at Belmont Park, New York's entertainment and sports venue and home of the New York Islanders. UBS Arena's inaugural presentation of Mega Bash will take place December 2023. Additionally, the companies will team to present newly created events at OVG venues including Moody Center in Austin, TX; newly opened Acrisure Arena in Greater Palm Springs, CA; and in the Orlando, FL area. The program is expected to be expanded to additional participating OVG venues across North America and eventually Europe.

""As one of the largest concert producers in the nation and trailblazers for Latin music, it is our mission to continue to build upon our legacy by creating more unparalleled live music experiences for audiences across the globe,"" said Alessandra Alarcón, president, SBS Entertainment. ""Our partnership with the Oak View Group is the first of its kind and we couldn't be more excited to work with them to expand our footprint across their world-class venues and connect more Latin music fans with the artists they love.""

The demand for Latin music continues to grow and sold-out tours around the world have become a profitable expansion opportunity with a growing openness to new artists and music. Recognizing the overall demand for Latin music, the 2022 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival (commonly called Coachella) doubled the number of Latin performers from the 2020 roster with more than 20 multi-genre Latin artists. Latin acts accounted for 22 of the 200 biggest tours in the world in 2022.

""As the popularity and globalization of Latin music continues to rise, we're delighted to partner with SBS Entertainment to broaden its audience, while delivering greater diversity across our business, and bringing its iconic live events to OVG's roster of world-class arenas,"" said Francesca Bodie, president of business development, Oak View Group. ""This partnership represents a foundation that we plan to grow, both nationally and internationally in the coming years, and we look forward to developing more programming with Alessandra and the SBS team.""

Widely regarded in industry circles as a leader in the Latino multimedia sector, SBS is the largest certified minority-owned, Hispanic-targeted media company in the nation, operating top-rated radio formats in the country's largest markets, including flagship WSKQ-FM in New York City, America's most-listened-to station in any language (and the #1 Spanish-language station in the world); Aire, the most expansive Spanish-language radio network with 300+ affiliates; LaMusica, the country's highest-rated and fastest growing Hispanic streaming app; MegaTV, the popular news and political commentary television network; and concert promoter SBS Entertainment and its perennially sold-out roster of signature live events.

SBS Entertainment's pre-pandemic Calibash 2020 dominated Billboard magazine's Top U.S. Concert Promoter's List as one of the highest grossing events in the nation, alongside ticketed performances by Elton John, Madonna, and Celine Dion.

Keith Yandle walked into coffee shops when he played hockey in New York and would hear people talking about the next Rangers game against the Islanders or the New Jersey Devils.

""When you play those teams, even during the regular season, it adds a little bit more,"" Yandle said. ""Those are fun rivalries.""

Take those rivalries and add the prospect of elimination. The results could mean a spring sports scene in the Big Apple area that hasn't happened in almost three decades.

All three New York-area teams are in the NHL playoffs this year - just the fourth time that has happened and the first since 2007. Add in the NBA's Knicks and Brooklyn Nets and it's the first time the city's five indoor major professional teams all qualified for the postseason since 1994, when the Rangers lifted the Stanley Cup.

The Devils and Rangers could face off in the playoffs for the first time since the 2012 Eastern Conference final. And given the teams' young talent and potential, it's easy to envision a championship parade coming to New York or North Jersey in the not-too-distant future.

""It's awesome for the sport,"" said Brian Boyle, who played for the Rangers and Devils before retiring and joining NHL Network. ""The passion, that's what drives it. That's what makes sports great, and they have that right there. And when they're all doing fairly well - there's no doormats now - it's exciting.""

Much like Major League Baseball's Subway Series between the Yankees and Mets, the mix of contending hockey teams in New York makes for interesting tension in the stands and in local establishments showing the games on TV.

""You're cheering against your neighbors, your cousins, your family,"" said Islanders forward Kyle Palmieri, who also played for the Devils after growing up in New Jersey. ""Everyone kind of has their own alliances.""

Because of that, visiting fans bleed into the crowd more easily than in other markets. But Zach Parise, now with the Islanders after captaining the Devils to the Cup Final in 2012, said it doesn't feel at all like a neutral-site game - certainly not in the playoffs.

""Both fanbases are so into it that they drown out the other half really quick,"" Parise said.

Yandle, who broke the NHL's consecutive games played record last season before retiring to join TNT, pointed out the New York-area teams all making the playoffs is good for the sport's bottom line, too, from revenue to ratings.

Former goalie Kevin Weekes, who played for all three and now works for ESPN, said: ""You can't put a price on"" playoff hockey at Madison Square Garden.

You can, and it's over $350 on the secondary market just to get into the place known as ""The World's Most Famous Arena.""

It may be a little cheaper at Prudential Center in Newark or sparkling new UBS Arena at Belmont Park on Long Island, which will host a postseason game for the first time in its second year of existence after the Islanders clinched their spot Wednesday night.

No matter where the games are, at least for the first round, the eyes of the hockey community will be drawn to New York or New Jersey just about every night. That's not something three-time Devils Stanley Cup-winning defenseman Ken Daneyko expected to experience again in his lifetime.

""When they do, all three in, it's great for our market, for New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Long Island - you name it,"" said Daneyko, who's now an NHL Network analyst. ""Hockey's at the forefront and that's what we love, what we want.""

Beyond adding more banners to hang from the rafters, it also could be a boon for youth hockey in the area. Much like Palmieri, James and Trevor van Riemsdyk and others from New York and New Jersey wanted to be like Mark Messier and Brian Leetch, the next generation of kids playing could say the same about Adam Fox, Jack Hughes and the other stars playing for the Rangers, Devils and Islanders.

""It has come a long way,"" Palmieri said. ""You look at the rinks that are being built and the youth hockey teams that are popping up, the opportunities for guys to make it to higher levels is really awesome. Any time you generate buzz about hockey in that market, it's doing well for youth hockey and everyone.""

https://triblive.com/sports/penguins-eliminated-from-postseason-contention-after-islanders-beat-canadiens/,Penguins' postseason hopes finally extinguished,"TribLIVE's Daily and Weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need, right to your inbox.

Perhaps the only thing sharper than Sidney Crosby’s dagger of a backhander is his comprehensive memory.

Ask him about any random game in November 2008 or some mundane goal a long-departed teammate scored during the late winter of 2014, he can recall seemingly any nugatory detail such as what kind of gloves he was wearing or if a linemate’s family was in the stands that night.

The final game of the 2014-15 regular season is one he has a pretty good recollection of.

Needing a win to reach the postseason, the Pittsburgh Penguins gutted out a narrow 2-0 road victory against a Buffalo Sabres organization blatantly tanking to secure the top overall pick of the upcoming draft (which ended up going to the Edmonton Oilers in the form of superstar forward Connor McDavid).

“I definitely remember having to win that game,” Crosby said in reference that night April. 11, 2015. “It being a pretty close one. ‘Suttsy’ (former Penguins forward Brandon Sutter) got a couple of goals in that game.”

The Penguins’ reward for that victory was a daunting first-round matchup with the New York Rangers, who tidily claimed the series in five games. But for one night in the visiting dressing room at what was then called First Niagara Center in downtown Buffalo, the Penguins rejoiced without a worry.

Eight years later, the Penguins won’t have any such luxury.

On Wednesday, they were formally eliminated from postseason contention for the first time since 2006.

The New York Islanders secured the final wild-card position in the Eastern Conference on Wednesday with a 4-2 home win against the Montreal Canadiens at UBS Arena in Elmont, N.Y.

That renders the Penguins’ regular-season finale, a road contest against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Thursday, meaningless with regard to the playoffs.

The Penguins had an opportunity to control their own fate as recently as Tuesday, but a 5-2 home loss to the Chicago Blackhawks, one of the NHL’s worst teams, put them at the mercy of the Islanders’ outcome Wednesday.

This brings to an end a streak of 16 consecutive seasons in which the Penguins have qualified for the playoffs. Their most recent season without a trip to the postseason came in 2005-06 during the rookie campaign of an 18-year-old Crosby.

“You know the league is tight, and the way it’s been here the last little bit, you knew it was going to come down to the last game or two,” a 35-year-old Crosby said after Tuesday’s loss. “We got an opportunity (Tuesday) to control our own destiny, and it didn’t work out. We’ve got to find a way to rebound here and find a way to win the next one.”

For a team that invested heavily last offseason in retaining a core group of luminaries and splendid supplements, hoping that its 82nd game of the season would even get them a chance to burrow into the playoffs and potentially get a first-round matchup against the NHL’s best team, the big, bad Boston Bruins, is woefully short of even the base level of any expectations.

Why are the Penguins — blessed with a roster stocked of future enshrines into the Hockey Hall of Fame and All-Stars — on the outside looking in at the last stage of the regular season?

“Consistency I think is the thing that sticks out,” said defenseman Jeff Petry, the team’s most prominent offseason addition last summer. “Whether it’s from game to game or period to period, we know the things that we do well that lead to results more times than not. There’s stretches of games where we were on top of that. And games where the details weren’t as sharp. You can definitely see a difference in the style of play. From games to games or period to period, there’s points throughout the season where the details and our execution weren’t there.”

What kind of lineup the Penguins will have there in Columbus remains to be seen. Coach Mike Sullivan indicated the result of the Canadiens-Islanders matchup will dictate who he dresses.

Even in the face of extirpation from postseason contention, Sullivan prepared his outfit during a practice session Wednesday in Cranberry as if Thursday’s game three hours to the west in Columbus will have gravity.

“We’re all human. We all have emotions,” Sullivan said. “We’ve got to live with those. The other aspect of it is that we’re not out of the playoffs until we’re out of the playoffs. We’ve got to operate on the assumption (Wednesday) that we still have meaningful hockey in front of us.

“We’re hopeful we’ll play a meaningful game in Columbus.”

Seemingly every game is meaningful to the Penguins’ captain, no matter what can or cannot be gained. Presumably, Thursday’s contest will as well, even if his team’s aspirations have been extinguished.

“It’s a situation that you’ve got to make the best of it,” Crosby said. “Prepare the same way today and hope that we get another chance.”",['Seth Rorabaugh'],2023-04-12 17:49:19-04:00
